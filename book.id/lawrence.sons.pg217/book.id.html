<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>THE EARLY MARRIED LIFE OF THE MORELS

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THE BOTTOMS''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>succeeded to <div class="bookquote">``Hell Row'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>. Hell Row was a block of thatched,
bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane. There
lived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits two fields away.
The brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely soiled by these small
mines, whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded
wearily in a circle round a gin. And all over the countryside were these
same pits, some of which had been worked in the time of Charles II, the
few colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth,
making queer mounds and little black places among the corn-fields and
the meadows. And the cottages of these coal-miners, in blocks and pairs
here and there, together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers,
straying over the parish, formed the village of Bestwood.

<p/>Then, some sixty years ago, a sudden change took place, gin-pits were
elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers. The coal and iron
field of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered. Carston, Waite
and Co. appeared. Amid tremendous excitement, Lord Palmerston formally
opened the company's first mine at Spinney Park, on the edge of Sherwood
Forest.

<p/>About this time the notorious Hell Row, which through growing old had
acquired an evil reputation, was burned down, and much dirt was cleansed
away.

<p/>Carston, Waite & Co. found they had struck on a good thing, so, down the
valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mines were sunk, until
soon there were six pits working. From Nuttall, high up on the sandstone
among the woods, the railway ran, past the ruined priory of the
Carthusians and past Robin Hood's Well, down to Spinney Park, then on to
Minton, a large mine among corn-fields; from Minton across the farmlands
of the valleyside to Bunker's Hill, branching off there, and running
north to Beggarlee and Selby, that looks over at Crich and the hills of
Derbyshire: six mines like black studs on the countryside, linked by a
loop of fine chain, the railway.

<p/>To accommodate the regiments of miners, Carston, Waite and Co. built the
Squares, great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of Bestwood,
and then, in the brook valley, on the site of Hell Row, they erected the
Bottoms.

<p/>The Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners' dwellings, two rows
of three, like the dots on a blank-six domino, and twelve houses in a
block. This double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp
slope from Bestwood, and looked out, from the attic windows at least, on
the slow climb of the valley towards Selby.

<p/>The houses themselves were substantial and very decent. One could walk
all round, seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in
the shadow of the bottom block, sweet-williams and pinks in the sunny
top block; seeing neat front windows, little porches, little privet
hedges, and dormer windows for the attics. But that was outside; that
was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers' wives.
The dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the back of the house, facing
inward between the blocks, looking at a scrubby back garden, and then at
the ash-pits. And between the rows, between the long lines of ash-pits,
went the alley, where the children played and the women gossiped and the
men smoked. So, the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms, that
was so well built and that looked so nice, were quite unsavoury because
people must live in the kitchen, and the kitchens opened on to that
nasty alley of ash-pits.

<p/>Mrs. Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms, which was already
twelve years old and on the downward path, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) descended to it from
Bestwood. But it was the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could do. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had an end
house in one of the top blocks, and thus had only one neighbour; on
the other side an extra strip of garden. And, having an end house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
enjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the <div class="bookquote">``between''
 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>houses, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of
five shillings a week. But this superiority in station was not much
consolation to Mrs. Morel.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was thirty-one years old, and had been married eight years. A rather
small woman, of delicate mould but resolute bearing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shrank a little
from the first contact with the Bottoms women. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came down in the
July, and in the September expected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) third baby.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband was a miner. They had only been in their new home three
weeks when the wakes, or fair, began. Morel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew, was sure to make
a holiday of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went off early on the Monday morning, the day of
the fair. The two children were highly excited. William, a boy of seven,
fled off immediately after breakfast, to prowl round the wakes ground,
leaving Annie, who was only five, to whine all morning to go also. Mrs.
Morel did her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) scarcely knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) neighbours yet, and knew no
one with whom to trust the little girl. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) promised to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to
the wakes after dinner.

<p/>William appeared at half-past twelve. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was a very active lad,
fair-haired, freckled, with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dane</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I have my dinner, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dane</b></font>) cried, rushing in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dane</b></font>) cap on.
<div class="bookquote">'''Cause it begins at half-past one, the man says so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can have your dinner as soon as it's done,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>replied the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it done?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue eyes staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in indignation.
<div class="bookquote">``Then I'm goin' be-out it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll do nothing of the sort. It will be done in five minutes. It is
only half-past twelve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll be beginnin',''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>the boy half cried, half shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't die if they do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, it's only
half-past twelve, so you've a full hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad began hastily to lay the table, and directly the three sat down.
They were eating batter-pudding and jam, when the boy jumped off his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
chair and stood perfectly stiff. Some distance away could be heard the
first small braying of a merry-go-round, and the tooting of a horn. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
face quivered as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, running to the dresser for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your pudding in your hand--and it's only five past one, so you
were wrong--you haven't got your twopence,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>cried the mother in a
breath.

<p/>The boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) twopence, then went
off without a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to go, I want to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie, beginning to cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the
mother. And later in the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trudged up the hill under the
tall hedge with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child. The hay was gathered from the fields, and
cattle were turned on to the eddish. It was warm, peaceful.

<p/>Mrs. Morel did not like the wakes. There were two sets of horses, one
going by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organs were grinding,
and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots, fearful screeching of the
cocoanut man's rattle, shouts of the Aunt Sally man, screeches from the
peep-show lady. The mother perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son gazing enraptured outside
the Lion Wallace booth, at the pictures of this famous lion that had
killed a negro and maimed for life two white men. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) alone,
and went to get Annie a spin of toffee. Presently the lad stood in front
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), wildly excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never said you was coming--isn't the' a lot of things?--that lion's
killed three men--I've spent my tuppence--an' look here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) pulled from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) pocket two egg-cups, with pink moss-roses on them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got these from that stall where y'ave ter get them marbles in
them holes. An' I got these two in two goes-`aepenny a go-they've got
moss-roses on, look here. I wanted these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wanted them for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said, pleased. <div class="bookquote">``They ARE pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you carry 'em, 'cause I'm frightened o' breakin' 'em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was tipful of excitement now she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) had come, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) about the ground,
showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) everything. Then, at the peep-show, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) explained the
pictures, in a sort of story, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) listened as if spellbound. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). All the time he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) stuck close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), bristling with
a small boy's pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). For no other woman looked such a lady as she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
did, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) little black bonnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) cloak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) smiled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) saw
women she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) knew. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was tired she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) son:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, are you coming now, or later?''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you goin' a`ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cried, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face full of reproach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Already? It is past four, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you goin' a`ready for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lamented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't come if you don't want,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) went slowly away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) little girl, whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) son stood
watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), cut to the heart to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) go, and yet unable to leave
the wakes. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) crossed the open ground in front of the Moon and Stars
she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) heard men shouting, and smelled the beer, and hurried a little,
thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) husband was probably in the bar.

<p/>At about half-past six her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) son came home, tired now, rather pale, and
somewhat wretched. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was miserable, though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not know it, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had let her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) go alone. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) had gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had not enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
wakes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has my dad been?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s helping to wait at the Moon and Stars. I seed him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) through that
black tin stuff wi' holes in, on the window, wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) sleeves rolled up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the mother shortly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s got no money. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'ll be
satisfied if he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) gets his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) `lowance, whether they give him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) more or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>When the light was fading, and Mrs. Morel could see no more to sew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
rose and went to the door. Everywhere was the sound of excitement, the
restlessness of the holiday, that at last infected her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went
out into the side garden. Women were coming home from the wakes, the
children hugging a white lamb with green legs, or a wooden horse.
Occasionally a man lurched past, almost as full as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could carry.
Sometimes a good husband came along with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) family, peacefully. But
usually the women and children were alone. The stay-at-home mothers
stood gossiping at the corners of the alley, as the twilight sank,
folding their arms under their white aprons.

<p/>Mrs. Morel was alone, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was used to it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) little
girl slept upstairs; so, it seemed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) home was there behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>),
fixed and stable. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt wretched with the coming child. The world
seemed a dreary place, where nothing else would happen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)--at
least until William grew up. But for herself, nothing but this dreary
endurance--till the children grew up. And the children! She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not
afford to have this third. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not want it. The father was serving
beer in a public house, swilling himself drunk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) despised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and
was tied to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). This coming child was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). If it were not
for William and Annie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was sick of it, the struggle with poverty and
ugliness and meanness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) went into the front garden, feeling too heavy to take herself out,
yet unable to stay indoors. The heat suffocated her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). And looking ahead,
the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) life made her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) feel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) were buried alive.

<p/>The front garden was a small square with a privet hedge. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
stood, trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the
fading, beautiful evening. Opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) small gate was the stile that
led uphill, under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut
pastures. The sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light. The glow sank
quickly off the field; the earth and the hedges smoked dusk. As it grew
dark, a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop, and out of the glare the
diminished commotion of the fair.

<p/>Sometimes, down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the
hedges, men came lurching home. One young man lapsed into a run down
the steep bit that ended the hill, and went with a crash into the stile.
Mrs. Morel shuddered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picked himself up, swearing viciously, rather
pathetically, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought the stile had wanted to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went indoors, wondering if things were never going to alter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
beginning by now to realise that they would not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) seemed so far
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) girlhood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wondered if it were the same person walking
heavily up the back garden at the Bottoms as had run so lightly up the
breakwater at Sheerness ten years before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I to do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``What have I to do
with all this? Even the child I am going to have! It doesn't seem as if
I were taken into account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sometimes life takes hold of one, carries the body along, accomplishes
one's history, and yet is not real, but leaves oneself as it were
slurred over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel said to herself--<div class="bookquote">``I wait, and what I wait for can
never come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) straightened the kitchen, lit the lamp, mended the fire, looked
out the washing for the next day, and put it to soak. After which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sewing. Through the long hours her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) needle flashed
regularly through the stuff. Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sighed, moving to relieve
herself. And all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was thinking how to make the most of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had, for the children's sakes.

<p/>At half-past eleven her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband came. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cheeks were very red and
very shiny above his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) black moustache. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head nodded slightly. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
pleased with himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Oh! waitin' for me, lass? I've bin `elpin' Anthony, an' what's
think he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s gen me? Nowt b'r a lousy hae`f-crown, an' that's ivry
penny--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) thinks you've made the rest up in beer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' I `aven't--that I `aven't. You b`lieve me, I've `ad very little
this day, I have an' all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) voice went tender. <div class="bookquote">``Here, an' I browt
thee a bit o' brandysnap, an' a cocoanut for th' children.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) laid the
gingerbread and the cocoanut, a hairy object, on the table. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, tha
niver said thankyer for nowt i' thy life, did ter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As a compromise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) picked up the cocoanut and shook it, to see if it
had any milk.

<p/>``It's a good `un, you may back yer life o' that. I got it fra' Bill
Hodgkisson. ``Bill,<div class="bookquote">'' I says, `tha non wants them three nuts, does ter?

 (<font color='red'><b>Walt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man will part with anything so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s drunk, and you're drunk
along with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, tha mucky little `ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said
Morel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hodgkisson</b></font>) was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodgkisson</b></font>) day's
helping to wait in the Moon and Stars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hodgkisson</b></font>) chattered on.

<p/>Mrs. Morel, very tired, and sick of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodgkisson</b></font>) babble, went to bed as quickly
as possible, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hodgkisson</b></font>) raked the fire.

<p/>Mrs. Morel came of a good old burgher family, famous independents
who had fought with Colonel Hutchinson, and who remained stout
Congregationalists. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lace-market
at a time when so many lace-manufacturers were ruined in Nottingham. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
father, George Coppard, was an engineer--a large, handsome, haughty
man, proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fair skin and blue eyes, but more proud still of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
integrity. Gertrude resembled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) small build. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
temper, proud and unyielding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had from the Coppards.

<p/>George Coppard was bitterly galled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) own poverty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) became foreman
of the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness. Mrs. Morel--Gertrude--was
the second daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) favoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mother, loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mother best of
all; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had the Coppards' clear, defiant blue eyes and their broad
brow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) remembered to have hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) father's overbearing manner
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) gentle, humorous, kindly-souled mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) remembered
running over the breakwater at Sheerness and finding the boat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
remembered to have been petted and flattered by all the men when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had
gone to the dockyard, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was a delicate, rather proud child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
remembered the funny old mistress, whose assistant she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had become, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had loved to help in the private school. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) still had the Bible
that John Field had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) used to walk home from chapel
with John Field when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was nineteen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Field</b></font>) was the son of a well-to-do
tradesman, had been to college in London, and was to devote himself to
business.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon, when
they had sat under the vine at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) father's house. The sun
came through the chinks of the vine-leaves and made beautiful patterns,
like a lace scarf, falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) and on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Some of the leaves were
clean yellow, like yellow flat flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now sit still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had cried. <div class="bookquote">``Now your hair, I don't know what it IS
like! It's as bright as copper and gold, as red as burnt copper, and
it has gold threads where the sun shines on it. Fancy their saying it's
brown. Your mother calls it mouse-colour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had met his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brilliant eyes, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) clear face scarcely showed the
elation which rose within her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you say you don't like business,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pursued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't. I hate it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried hotly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would like to go into the ministry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) half implored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should. I should love it, if I thought I could make a first-rate
preacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then why don't you--why DON``T you?'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) voice rang with defiance. <div class="bookquote">``If I
were a man, nothing would stop me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head erect. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was rather timid before her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my father's so stiff-necked. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) means to put me into the business,
and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you're a MAN?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Being a man isn't everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied, frowning with puzzled
helplessness.

<p/>Now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) moved about her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) work at the Bottoms, with some experience of
what being a man meant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew that it was NOT everything.

<p/>At twenty, owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) health, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had left Sheerness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) father had
retired home to Nottingham. John Field's father had been ruined; the
son had gone as a teacher in Norwood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) until, two
years later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) made determined inquiry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) had married his (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) landlady, a
woman of forty, a widow with property.

<p/>And still Mrs. Morel preserved John Field's Bible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not now
believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Field</b></font>) to be--Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) understood pretty well what he (<font color='blue'><b>Field</b></font>) might or
might not have been. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Field</b></font>) Bible, and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Field</b></font>) memory
intact in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own sake. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dying day, for thirty-five
years, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Field</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was twenty-three years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) met, at a Christmas party, a
young man from the Erewash Valley. Morel was then twenty-seven years
old. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was well set-up, erect, and very smart. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wavy black hair
that shone again, and a vigorous black beard that had never been shaved.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks were ruddy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) red, moist mouth was noticeable because
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed so often and so heartily. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had that rare thing, a rich,
ringing laugh. Gertrude Coppard had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), fascinated. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
so full of colour and animation, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice ran so easily into comic
grotesque, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so ready and so pleasant with everybody. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) own
father had a rich fund of humour, but it was satiric. This man's was
different: soft, non-intellectual, warm, a kind of gambolling.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) herself was opposite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) had a curious, receptive mind which found
much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) was clever
in leading folk to talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) loved ideas, and was considered very
intellectual. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) liked most of all was an argument on religion or
philosophy or politics with some educated man. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) did not often
enjoy. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) always had people tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) about themselves, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>)
pleasure so.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) person she (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) was rather small and delicate, with a large brow, and
dropping bunches of brown silk curls. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) blue eyes were very straight,
honest, and searching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) had the beautiful hands of the Coppards.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) dress was always subdued. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) wore dark blue silk, with a peculiar
silver chain of silver scallops. This, and a heavy brooch of twisted
gold, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) only ornament. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) was still perfectly intact, deeply
religious, and full of beautiful candour.

<p/>Walter Morel seemed melted away before her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) was to the miner that
thing of mystery and fascination, a lady. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), it was
with a southern pronunciation and a purity of English which thrilled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to hear. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) danced well, as if it were natural and
joyous in him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to dance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) grandfather was a French refugee who had
married an English barmaid--if it had been a marriage. Gertrude Coppard
watched the young miner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) danced, a certain subtle exultation like
glamour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) movement, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face the flower of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) body, ruddy,
with tumbled black hair, and laughing alike whatever partner he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bowed
above. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rather wonderful, never having met anyone like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) father was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) the type of all men. And George Coppard,
proud in his (<font color='blue'><b>Coppard</b></font>) bearing, handsome, and rather bitter; who preferred
theology in reading, and who drew near in sympathy only to one man, the
Apostle Paul; who was harsh in government, and in familiarity ironic;
who ignored all sensuous pleasure:--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was very different from the
miner. Gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had not
the slightest inclination towards that accomplishment, and had never
learned even a Roger de Coverley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was puritan, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father,
high-minded, and really stern. Therefore the dusky, golden softness of
this man's sensuous flame of life, that flowed off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flesh like the
flame from a candle, not baffled and gripped into incandescence by
thought and spirit as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) life was, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) something wonderful,
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came and bowed above her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). A warmth radiated through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had
drunk wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now do come and have this one wi' me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said caressively. <div class="bookquote">``It's easy,
you know. I'm pining to see you dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) could not dance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humility
and smiled. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) smile was very beautiful. It moved the man so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
forgot everything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said softly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) words came clean and ringing.

<p/>Not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was doing--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often did the right thing by
instinct--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), inclining reverentially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you mustn't miss your dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) reproved.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I don't want to dance that--it's not one as I care about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you invited me to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed very heartily at this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought o' that. Tha`rt not long in taking the curl out of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) turn to laugh quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't look as if you'd come much uncurled,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm like a pig's tail, I curl because I canna help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed,
rather boisterously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are a miner!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) exclaimed in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I went down when I was ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in wondering dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you were ten! And wasn't it very hard?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You soon get used to it. You live like th' mice, an' you pop out at
night to see what's going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel blind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like a moudiwarp!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Yi, an' there's some chaps as does
go round like moudiwarps.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face forward in the blind,
snout-like way of a mole, seeming to sniff and peer for direction. <div class="bookquote">``They
dun though!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protested naively. <div class="bookquote">``Tha niver seed such a way they get
in. But tha mun let me ta'e thee down some time, an' tha can see for
thysen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), startled. This was a new tract of life suddenly
opened before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) realised the life of the miners, hundreds of them
toiling below earth and coming up at evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) noble. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
risked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life daily, and with gaiety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with a touch
of appeal in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) pure humility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't ter like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked tenderly. <div class="bookquote">''`Appen not, it `ud dirty
thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had never been <div class="bookquote">``thee'd''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``thou'd''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>before.

<p/>The next Christmas they were married, and for three months she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was
perfectly happy: for six months she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was very happy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had signed the pledge, and wore the blue ribbon of a tee-totaller: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was nothing if not showy. They lived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) thought, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house.
It was small, but convenient enough, and quite nicely furnished,
with solid, worthy stuff that suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) honest soul. The women, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
neighbours, were rather foreign to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), and Morel's mother and sisters
were apt to sneer at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ladylike ways. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could perfectly well
live by herself, so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband close.

<p/>Sometimes, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) herself wearied of love-talk, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tried to open her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
heart seriously to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) listen deferentially, but without
understanding. This killed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) efforts at a finer intimacy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
flashes of fear. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was restless of an evening: it was not
enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) just to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) realised. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was glad when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
set himself to little jobs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a remarkably handy man--could make or mend anything. So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like that coal-rake of your mother's--it is small and natty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does ter, my wench? Well, I made that, so I can make thee one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! why, it's a steel one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' what if it is! Tha s`lt ha'e one very similar, if not exactly
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not mind the mess, nor the hammering and noise. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was busy and
happy.

<p/>But in the seventh month, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) Sunday coat, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
felt papers in the breast pocket, and, seized with a sudden curiosity,
took them out to read. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) very rarely wore the frock-coat he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was married
in: and it had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before to feel curious concerning the
papers. They were the bills of the household furniture, still unpaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said at night, after he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was washed and had had his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
dinner. <div class="bookquote">``I found these in the pocket of your wedding-coat. Haven't you
settled the bills yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I haven't had a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you told me all was paid. I had better go into Nottingham on
Saturday and settle them. I don't like sitting on another man's chairs
and eating from an unpaid table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can have your bank-book, can't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha can ha'e it, for what good it'll be to thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a good bit of money left
over. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) realised it was no use asking questions. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat rigid
with bitterness and indignation.

<p/>The next day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went down to see his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you buy the furniture for Walter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>tartly retorted the elder woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how much did he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) give you to pay for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder woman was stung with fine indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighty pound, if you're so keen on knowin',''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighty pounds! But there are forty-two pounds still owing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where has it all gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find all the papers, I think, if you look--beside ten pound as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) owed me, an' six pound as the wedding cost down here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Six pounds!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Morel</b></font>)</div>echoed Gertrude Morel. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) monstrous that,
after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own father had paid so heavily for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wedding, six pounds
more should have been squandered in eating and drinking at Walter's
parents' house, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) expense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how much has he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) sunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) houses?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) houses--which houses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude Morel went white to the lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
lived in, and the next one, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought the house we live in--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're my houses, those two,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother-in-law</b></font>)</div>said the mother-in-law. <div class="bookquote">``And not clear
either. It's as much as I can do to keep the mortgage interest paid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude sat white and silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we ought to be paying you rent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter is paying me rent,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>replied the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what rent?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Six and six a week,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>retorted the mother.

<p/>It was more than the house was worth. Gertrude held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) head erect,
looked straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is lucky to be you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the elder woman, bitingly, <div class="bookquote">``to have a
husband as takes all the worry of the money, and leaves you a free
hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The young wife was silent.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said very little to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) manner had changed towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) proud, honourable soul had crystallised out hard
as rock.

<p/>When October came in, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought only of Christmas. Two years ago, at
Christmas, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Last Christmas she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had married him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). This
Christmas she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would bear him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't dance yourself, do you, missis?''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nearest neighbour,
in October, when there was great talk of opening a dancing-class over
the Brick and Tile Inn at Bestwood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I never had the least inclination to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy! An' how funny as you should ha' married your Mester. You know
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s quite a famous one for dancing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was famous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>laughed Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yea, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is though! Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ran that dancing-class in the Miners' Arms
club-room for over five year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did.''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The other woman was defiant. <div class="bookquote">``An' it was thronged
every Tuesday, and Thursday, an' Sat`day--an' there WAS carryin's-on,
accordin' to all accounts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>This kind of thing was gall and bitterness to Mrs. Morel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had
a fair share of it. The women did not spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), at first; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
superior, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not help it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) began to be rather late in coming home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're working very late now, aren't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
washer-woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No later than they allers do, I don't think. But they stop to have
their pint at Ellen's, an' they get talkin', an' there you are! Dinner
stone cold--an' it serves 'em right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Morel does not take any drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman dropped the clothes, looked at Mrs. Morel, then went on with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) work, saying nothing.

<p/>Gertrude Morel was very ill when the boy was born. Morel was good to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), as good as gold. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt very lonely, miles away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own
people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt lonely with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) now, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) presence only made it more
intense.

<p/>The boy was small and frail at first, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came on quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
a beautiful child, with dark gold ringlets, and dark-blue eyes which
changed gradually to a clear grey. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother loved him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) passionately.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came just when her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear;
when her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faith in life was shaken, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul felt dreary and lonely.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made much of the child, and the father was jealous.

<p/>At last Mrs. Morel despised her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) turned to the child; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
turned from the father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had begun to neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>); the novelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own home was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no grit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said bitterly to herself. What
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt just at the minute, that was all to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not abide by
anything. There was nothing at the back of all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) show.

<p/>There began a battle between the husband and wife--a fearful, bloody
battle that ended only with the death of one. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fought to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
undertake his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own responsibilities, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) obligations.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was too different from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nature was purely sensuous, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) strove to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) moral, religious. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to force him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to face
things. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not endure it--it drove him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind.

<p/>While the baby was still tiny, the father's temper had become so
irritable that it was not to be trusted. The child had only to give a
little trouble when the man began to bully. A little more, and the hard
hands of the collier hit the baby. Then Mrs. Morel loathed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband,
loathed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for days; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went out and drank; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cared very
little what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did. Only, on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) scathed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
satire.

<p/>The estrangement between them caused him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), knowingly or unknowingly,
grossly to offend her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not have done.

<p/>William was only one year old, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
so pretty. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not well off now, but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sisters kept the boy in
clothes. Then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little white hat curled with an ostrich feather,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) white coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a joy to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), the twining wisps of hair
clustering round his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head. Mrs. Morel lay listening, one Sunday morning,
to the chatter of the father and child downstairs. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dozed off.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came downstairs, a great fire glowed in the grate, the room was
hot, the breakfast was roughly laid, and seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) armchair, against
the chimney-piece, sat Morel, rather timid; and standing between
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) legs, the child--cropped like a sheep, with such an odd round
poll--looking wondering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>); and on a newspaper spread out upon
the hearthrug, a myriad of crescent-shaped curls, like the petals of a
marigold scattered in the reddening firelight.

<p/>Mrs. Morel stood still. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) first baby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went very white, and
was unable to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What dost think o' `im?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Morel laughed uneasily.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) two fists, lifted them, and came forward. Morel shrank
back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could kill you, I could!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) choked with rage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) two
fists uplifted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer non want ter make a wench on `im,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Morel said, in a frightened
tone, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head to shield his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes from hers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) attempt at
laughter had vanished.

<p/>The mother looked down at the jagged, close-clipped head of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hair, and stroked and fondled his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faltered. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lip trembled, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face broke, and,
snatching up the child, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shoulder and cried
painfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was one of those women who cannot cry; whom it hurts as
it hurts a man. It was like ripping something out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sobbing.

<p/>Morel sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands gripped together till
the knuckles were white. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gazed in the fire, feeling almost stunned,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not breathe.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came to an end, soothed the child and cleared away the
breakfast-table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) left the newspaper, littered with curls, spread
upon the hearthrug. At last her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband gathered it up and put it at
the back of the fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went about her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) work with closed mouth and very
quiet. Morel was subdued. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) crept about wretchedly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) meals were
a misery that day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) civilly, and never alluded to what
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had done. But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt something final had happened.

<p/>Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had been silly, that the boy's hair would have
had to be cut, sooner or later. In the end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) even brought herself to
say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband it was just as well he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had played barber when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
did. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew, and Morel knew, that that act had caused something
momentous to take place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) remembered the scene all her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
life, as one in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had suffered the most intensely.

<p/>This act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
love for Morel. Before, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had striven against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bitterly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
had fretted after him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had gone astray from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) ceased
to fret for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love: he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was an outsider to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). This made life much
more bearable.

<p/>Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) still continued to strive with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) still had her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
high moral sense, inherited from generations of Puritans. It was now a
religious instinct, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was almost a fanatic with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), or had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sinned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
drank, and lied, was often a poltroon, sometimes a knave, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wielded
the lash unmercifully.

<p/>The pity was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was too much his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opposite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not be content
with the little he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might be; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the much that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ought
to be. So, in seeking to make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nobler than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) destroyed
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) injured and hurt and scarred herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lost none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
worth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) also had the children.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drank rather heavily, though not more than many miners, and always
beer, so that whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) health was affected, it was never injured.
The week-end was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chief carouse. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat in the Miners' Arms until
turning-out time every Friday, every Saturday, and every Sunday evening.
On Monday and Tuesday he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten
o'clock. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stayed at home on Wednesday and Thursday evenings,
or was only out for an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) practically never had to miss work owing
to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drinking.

<p/>But although he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was very steady at work, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wages fell off. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
blab-mouthed, a tongue-wagger. Authority was hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), therefore
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could only abuse the pit-managers. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would say, in the Palmerston:

<p/>``Th' gaffer come down to our stall this morning, an' 'e says, ``You know,
Walter, this `ere'll not do. What about these props?'' An' I says to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
``Why, what art talkin' about? What d'st mean about th' props?'' ``It'll
never do, this <div class="bookquote">``ere,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'e says. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be havin' th' roof in, one o'
these days.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>An' I says, ``Tha'd better stan' on a bit o' clunch, then,
an' hold it up wi' thy ``ead.<div class="bookquote">'' So 'e wor that mad, 'e cossed an' 'e
swore, an' t`other chaps they did laugh.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Morel was a good mimic. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
imitated the manager's fat, squeaky voice, with its attempt at good
English.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''I shan't have it, Walter. Who knows more about it, me or you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the manager</b></font>)</div>So
I says, <div class="bookquote">``I've niver fun out how much tha' knows, Alfred. It'll `appen
carry thee ter bed an' back.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>So Morel would go on to the amusement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) boon companions. And some
of this would be true. The pit-manager was not an educated man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
been a boy along with Morel, so that, while the two disliked each other,
they more or less took each other for granted. But Alfred Charlesworth
did not forgive the butty these public-house sayings. Consequently,
although Morel was a good miner, sometimes earning as much as five
pounds a week when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) married, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) came gradually to have worse and worse
stalls, where the coal was thin, and hard to get, and unprofitable.

<p/>Also, in summer, the pits are slack. Often, on bright sunny mornings,
the men are seen trooping home again at ten, eleven, or twelve o'clock.
No empty trucks stand at the pit-mouth. The women on the hillside look
across as they shake the hearthrug against the fence, and count the
wagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley. And the
children, as they come from school at dinner-time, looking down the
fields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing, say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Minton's knocked off. My dad'll be at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>And there is a sort of shadow over all, women and children and men,
because money will be short at the end of the week.

<p/>Morel was supposed to give his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) wife thirty shillings a week, to
provide everything--rent, food, clothes, clubs, insurance, doctors.
Occasionally, if he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) were flush, he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thirty-five. But these
occasions by no means balanced those when he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) twenty-five. In
winter, with a decent stall, the miner might earn fifty or fifty-five
shillings a week. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was happy. On Friday night, Saturday, and
Sunday, he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) spent royally, getting rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) sovereign or thereabouts.
And out of so much, he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) scarcely spared the children an extra penny or
bought them a pound of apples. It all went in drink. In the bad times,
matters were more worrying, but he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was not so often drunk, so that Mrs.
Morel used to say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be short, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>)'s flush, there
isn't a minute of peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) earned forty shillings he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept ten; from thirty-five he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept five;
from thirty-two he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept four; from twenty-eight he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept three; from
twenty-four he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept two; from twenty he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept one-and-six; from eighteen
he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept a shilling; from sixteen he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept sixpence. He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) never saved a
penny, and he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) wife no opportunity of saving; instead, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
occasionally to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) debts; not public-house debts, for those never
were passed on to the women, but debts when he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had bought a canary, or a
fancy walking-stick.

<p/>At the wakes time Morel was working badly, and Mrs. Morel was trying
to save against her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) confinement. So it galled her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bitterly to think
he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) should be out taking his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) pleasure and spending money, whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
remained at home, harassed. There were two days' holiday. On the Tuesday
morning Morel rose early. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was in good spirits. Quite early, before
six o'clock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) whistling away to himself downstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
had a pleasant way of whistling, lively and musical. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) nearly always
whistled hymns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had been a choir-boy with a beautiful voice, and had
taken solos in Southwell cathedral. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) morning whistling alone betrayed
it.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wife lay listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tinkering away in the garden, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
whistling ringing out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sawed and hammered away. It always gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a sense of warmth and peace to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thus as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lay in bed, the
children not yet awake, in the bright early morning, happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) man's
fashion.

<p/>At nine o'clock, while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting
playing on the sofa, and the mother was washing up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came in from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
carpentry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sleeves rolled up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) waistcoat hanging open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
still a good-looking man, with black, wavy hair, and a large black
moustache. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face was perhaps too much inflamed, and there was about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) a look almost of peevishness. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was jolly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went straight
to the sink where his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wife was washing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, are thee there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said boisterously. <div class="bookquote">``Sluthe off an' let me
wesh mysen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may wait till I've finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mun I? An' what if I shonna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>This good-humoured threat amused Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you can go and wash yourself in the soft-water tub.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! I can' an' a', tha mucky little `ussy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stood watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) a moment, then went away to wait for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) chose he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could still make himself again a real gallant. Usually
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) preferred to go out with a scarf round his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) neck. Now, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
made a toilet. There seemed so much gusto in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) puffed and
swilled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) washed himself, so much alacrity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hurried to
the mirror in the kitchen, and, bending because it was too low for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>),
scrupulously parted his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wet black hair, that it irritated Mrs. Morel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
put on a turn-down collar, a black bow, and wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) Sunday tail-coat.
As such, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked spruce, and what his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) clothes would not do, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
instinct for making the most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) good looks would.

<p/>At half-past nine Jerry Purdy came to call for his (<font color='blue'><b>Purdy</b></font>) pal. Jerry was
Morel's bosom friend, and Mrs. Morel disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was a tall,
thin man, with a rather foxy face, the kind of face that seems to lack
eyelashes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) walked with a stiff, brittle dignity, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) head were
on a wooden spring. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) nature was cold and shrewd. Generous where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
intended to be generous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) seemed to be very fond of Morel, and more or
less to take charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Morel hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had known his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wife, who had died of
consumption, and who had, at the end, conceived such a violent dislike
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) room it caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) haemorrhage.
None of which Jerry had seemed to mind. And now his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) eldest daughter,
a girl of fifteen, kept a poor house for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), and looked after the two
younger children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A mean, wizzen-hearted stick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never known Jerry mean in MY life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>protested Morel. <div class="bookquote">``A
opener-handed and more freer chap you couldn't find anywhere, accordin'
to my knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Open-handed to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>retorted Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``But his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) fist is shut tight
enough to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) children, poor things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor things! And what for are they poor things, I should like to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs. Morel would not be appeased on Jerry's score.

<p/>The subject of argument was seen, craning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) thin neck over the
scullery curtain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) caught Mrs. Morel's eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mornin', missis! Mester in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerry entered unasked, and stood by the kitchen doorway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was not
invited to sit down, but stood there, coolly asserting the rights of men
and husbands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) said to Mrs. Morel.

<p/>``Yes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grand out this morning--grand for a walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Do you mean YOU<div class="bookquote">``RE going for a walk?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. We mean walkin' to Nottingham,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men greeted each other, both glad: Jerry, however, full of
assurance, Morel rather subdued, afraid to seem too jubilant in presence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) wife. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) laced his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) boots quickly, with spirit. They were
going for a ten-mile walk across the fields to Nottingham. Climbing the
hillside from the Bottoms, they mounted gaily into the morning. At the
Moon and Stars they had their first drink, then on to the Old Spot. Then
a long five miles of drought to carry them into Bulwell to a glorious
pint of bitter. But they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose
gallon bottle was full, so that, when they came in sight of the city,
Morel was sleepy. The town spread upwards before them, smoking vaguely
in the midday glare, fridging the crest away to the south with spires
and factory bulks and chimneys. In the last field Morel lay down under
an oak tree and slept soundly for over an hour. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rose to go
forward he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt queer.

<p/>The two had dinner in the Meadows, with Jerry's sister, then repaired
to the Punch Bowl, where they mixed in the excitement of pigeon-racing.
Morel never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) life played cards, considering them as having some
occult, malevolent power--<div class="bookquote">``the devil's pictures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) called them! But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was a master of skittles and of dominoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) took a challenge from
a Newark man, on skittles. All the men in the old, long bar took sides,
betting either one way or the other. Morel took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) coat. Jerry held
the hat containing the money. The men at the tables watched. Some
stood with their mugs in their hands. Morel felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) big wooden ball
carefully, then launched it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) played havoc among the nine-pins, and
won half a crown, which restored him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) to solvency.

<p/>By seven o'clock the two were in good condition. They caught the 7.30
train home.

<p/>In the afternoon the Bottoms was intolerable. Every inhabitant remaining
was out of doors. The women, in twos and threes, bareheaded and in white
aprons, gossiped in the alley between the blocks. Men, having a rest
between drinks, sat on their heels and talked. The place smelled stale;
the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat.

<p/>Mrs. Morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows, which
were not more than two hundred yards away. The water ran quickly over
stones and broken pots. Mother and child leaned on the rail of the old
sheep-bridge, watching. Up at the dipping-hole, at the other end of the
meadow, Mrs. Morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the
deep yellow water, or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over
the blackish stagnant meadow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew William was at the dipping-hole,
and it was the dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) life lest he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should get drowned. Annie
played under the tall old hedge, picking up alder cones, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) called
currants. The child required much attention, and the flies were teasing.

<p/>The children were put to bed at seven o'clock. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) worked awhile.

<p/>When Walter Morel and Jerry arrived at Bestwood they felt a load off
their minds; a railway journey no longer impended, so they could put the
finishing touches to a glorious day. They entered the Nelson with the
satisfaction of returned travellers.

<p/>The next day was a work-day, and the thought of it put a damper on the
men's spirits. Most of them, moreover, had spent their money. Some were
already rolling dismally home, to sleep in preparation for the morrow.
Mrs. Morel, listening to their mournful singing, went indoors. Nine
o'clock passed, and ten, and still <div class="bookquote">``the pair''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had not returned. On a
doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly, in a drawl: <div class="bookquote">``Lead, kindly
Light.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they
must sing that hymn when they got maudlin.

<p/>``As if <div class="bookquote">``Genevieve' weren't good enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>The kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops. On the hob a
large black saucepan steamed slowly. Mrs. Morel took a panchion, a great
bowl of thick red earth, streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom,
and then, straining herself to the weight, was pouring in the liquor.

<p/>Just then Morel came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been very jolly in the Nelson, but
coming home had grown irritable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) had not quite got over the feeling
of irritability and pain, after having slept on the ground when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) was
so hot; and a bad conscience afflicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) neared the house.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) did not know he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) was angry. But when the garden gate resisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>)
attempts to open it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) kicked it and broke the latch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) entered just
as Mrs. Morel was pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan.
Swaying slightly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) lurched against the table. The boiling liquor
pitched. Mrs. Morel started back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``coming home in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) drunkenness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Comin' home in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) snarled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) hat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) blood rose in a jet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say you're NOT drunk!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) flashed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saucepan, and was stirring the sugar into the
beer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) two hands heavily on the table, and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) face
forwards at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Say you're not drunk,'''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Why, nobody but a nasty little
bitch like you `ud `ave such a thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) face forward at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's money to bezzle with, if there's money for nothing else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not spent a two-shillin' bit this day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't get as drunk as a lord on nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``And,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried, flashing into sudden fury, <div class="bookquote">``if you've been sponging on your
beloved Jerry, why, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) children, for they need it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a lie, it's a lie. Shut your face, woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now at battle-pitch. Each forgot everything save the hatred of
the other and the battle between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was fiery and furious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>).
They went on till he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) a liar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried, starting up, scarce able to breathe. <div class="bookquote">``Don't call me
that--you, the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoe-leather.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) forced the last words out of suffocated lungs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) yelled, banging the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) fist. <div class="bookquote">``You're a
liar, you're a liar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stiffened herself, with clenched fists.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The house is filthy with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then get out on it--it's mine. Get out on it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``It's me as
brings th' money whoam, not thee. It's my house, not thine. Then ger out
on't--ger out on't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I would,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried, suddenly shaken into tears of impotence. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,
wouldn't I, wouldn't I have gone long ago, but for those children. Ay,
haven't I repented not going years ago, when I'd only the one'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--suddenly
drying into rage. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think it's for YOU I stop--do you think I'd
stop one minute for YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) shouted, beside himself. <div class="bookquote">``Go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) faced round. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried loudly, <div class="bookquote">``you shan't have it ALL
your own way; you shan't do ALL you like. I've got those children to see
to. My word,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``I should look well to leave them to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) cried thickly, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) fist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be only too glad. I should laugh, laugh, my lord, if I could
get away from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) red face, with its bloodshot eyes, thrust
forward, and gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried in fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>), struggled to be
free. Coming slightly to himself, panting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) roughly to the
outer door, and thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) forth, slotting the bolt behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) with a
bang. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) went back into the kitchen, dropped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) armchair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>)
head, bursting full of blood, sinking between his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) knees. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelson</b></font>) dipped
gradually into a stupor, from exhaustion and intoxication.

<p/>The moon was high and magnificent in the August night. Mrs. Morel,
seared with passion, shivered to find herself out there in a great white
light, that fell cold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), and gave a shock to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) inflamed soul.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great
rhubarb leaves near the door. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) got the air into her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) breast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
walked down the garden path, trembling in every limb, while the child
boiled within her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). For a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not control her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) consciousness;
mechanically she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went over the last scene, then over it again, certain
phrases, certain moments coming each time like a brand red-hot down on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soul; and each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) enacted again the past hour, each time the
brand came down at the same points, till the mark was burnt in, and the
pain burnt out, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) must have been half
an hour in this delirious condition. Then the presence of the night came
again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) glanced round in fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had wandered to the side
garden, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was walking up and down the path beside the currant
bushes under the long wall. The garden was a narrow strip, bounded from
the road, that cut transversely between the blocks, by a thick thorn
hedge.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hurried out of the side garden to the front, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could stand
as if in an immense gulf of white light, the moon streaming high in face
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), the moonlight standing up from the hills in front, and filling
the valley where the Bottoms crouched, almost blindingly. There, panting
and half weeping in reaction from the stress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) murmured to herself
over and over again: <div class="bookquote">``The nuisance! the nuisance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) became aware of something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). With an effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) roused
herself to see what it was that penetrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) consciousness. The tall
white lilies were reeling in the moonlight, and the air was charged with
their perfume, as with a presence. Mrs. Morel gasped slightly in fear.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) touched the big, pallid flowers on their petals, then shivered.
They seemed to be stretching in the moonlight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand into
one white bin: the gold scarcely showed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) fingers by moonlight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
bent down to look at the binful of yellow pollen; but it only appeared
dusky. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) drank a deep draught of the scent. It almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
dizzy.

<p/>Mrs. Morel leaned on the garden gate, looking out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lost herself
awhile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thought. Except for a slight feeling
of sickness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) consciousness in the child, herself melted out like
scent into the shiny, pale air. After a time the child, too, melted with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) in the mixing-pot of moonlight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rested with the hills and
lilies and houses, all swum together in a kind of swoon.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came to herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was tired for sleep. Languidly she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>); the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spread with
linen; a moth ricochetted over them, and right across the garden.
Following it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eye roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). A few whiffs of the raw, strong
scent of phlox invigorated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) passed along the path, hesitating at
the white rose-bush. It smelled sweet and simple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) touched the white
ruffles of the roses. Their fresh scent and cool, soft leaves reminded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) of the morning-time and sunshine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was very fond of them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was tired, and wanted to sleep. In the mysterious out-of-doors she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt
forlorn.

<p/>There was no noise anywhere. Evidently the children had not been
wakened, or had gone to sleep again. A train, three miles away,
roared across the valley. The night was very large, and very strange,
stretching its hoary distances infinitely. And out of the silver-grey
fog of darkness came sounds vague and hoarse: a corncrake not far off,
sound of a train like a sigh, and distant shouts of men.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hurried down
the side garden to the back of the house. Softly she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lifted the latch;
the door was still bolted, and hard against her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rapped gently,
waited, then rapped again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) must not rouse the children, nor the
neighbours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) must be asleep, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would not wake easily. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart
began to burn to be indoors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) clung to the door-handle. Now it was
cold; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would take a chill, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) present condition!

<p/>Putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hurried again to the
side garden, to the window of the kitchen. Leaning on the sill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
could just see, under the blind, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband's arms spread out on the
table, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) black head on the board. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was sleeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face
lying on the table. Something in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) attitude made her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) feel tired of
things. The lamp was burning smokily; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could tell by the copper
colour of the light. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tapped at the window more and more noisily.
Almost it seemed as if the glass would break. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not wake up.

<p/>After vain efforts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) began to shiver, partly from contact with the
stone, and from exhaustion. Fearful always for the unborn child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
wondered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could do for warmth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went down to the coal-house,
where there was an old hearthrug she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had carried out for the rag-man the
day before. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wrapped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shoulders. It was warm, if grimy.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) walked up and down the garden path, peeping every now and then
under the blind, knocking, and telling herself that in the end the very
strain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) position must wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>At last, after about an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rapped long and low at the window.
Gradually the sound penetrated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). When, in despair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had ceased
to tap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stir, then lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face blindly. The labouring of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) into consciousness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rapped imperatively at the
window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) started awake. Instantly she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) fists set and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
eyes glare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had not a grain of physical fear. If it had been
twenty burglars, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would have gone blindly for them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) glared round,
bewildered, but prepared to fight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Open the door, Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said coldly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hands relaxed. It dawned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had done. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head dropped,
sullen and dogged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hurry to the door, heard the bolt chock.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tried the latch. It opened--and there stood the silver-grey night,
fearful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), after the tawny light of the lamp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hurried back.

<p/>When Mrs. Morel entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) almost running through the door
to the stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had ripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) collar off his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) neck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) haste to
be gone ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came in, and there it lay with bursten button-holes. It
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) angry.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) warmed and soothed herself. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) weariness forgetting everything,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) moved about at the little tasks that remained to be done, set his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
breakfast, rinsed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pit-bottle, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pit-clothes on the hearth
to warm, set his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pit-boots beside them, put him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) out a clean scarf and
snap-bag and two apples, raked the fire, and went to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was already
dead asleep. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) narrow black eyebrows were drawn up in a sort of
peevish misery into his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) forehead while his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cheeks' down-strokes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
sulky mouth, seemed to be saying: <div class="bookquote">``I don't care who you are nor what you
are, I SHALL have my own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) too well to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) unfastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
brooch at the mirror, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) smiled faintly to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face all smeared
with the yellow dust of lilies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) brushed it off, and at last lay
down. For some time her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mind continued snapping and jetting sparks,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was asleep before her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband awoke from the first sleep of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
drunkenness.



<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>THE BIRTH OF PAUL, AND ANOTHER BATTLE

<p/>AFTER such a scene as the last, Walter Morel was for some days abashed
and ashamed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soon regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) old bullying indifference. Yet
there was a slight shrinking, a diminishing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) assurance. Physically
even, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shrank, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) fine full presence waned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) never grew in the
least stout, so that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sank from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) erect, assertive bearing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
physique seemed to contract along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pride and moral strength.

<p/>But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) realised how hard it was for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wife to drag about at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
work, and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sympathy quickened by penitence, hastened forward with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came straight home from the pit, and stayed in at evening
till Friday, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not remain at home. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was back again
by ten o'clock, almost quite sober.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) always made his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own breakfast. Being a man who rose early and had
plenty of time he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not, as some miners do, drag his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wife out of bed
at six o'clock. At five, sometimes earlier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) woke, got straight out of
bed, and went downstairs. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not sleep, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wife lay waiting
for this time, as for a period of peace. The only real rest seemed to be
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was out of the house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went downstairs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shirt and then struggled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
pit-trousers, which were left on the hearth to warm all night. There
was always a fire, because Mrs. Morel raked. And the first sound in
the house was the bang, bang of the poker against the raker, as Morel
smashed the remainder of the coal to make the kettle, which was filled
and left on the hob, finally boil. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cup and knife and fork, all he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
wanted except just the food, was laid ready on the table on a newspaper.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) breakfast, made the tea, packed the bottom of the doors
with rugs to shut out the draught, piled a big fire, and sat down to an
hour of joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) toasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bacon on a fork and caught the drops of fat
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bread; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) put the rasher on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thick slice of bread, and
cut off chunks with a clasp-knife, poured his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tea into his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saucer,
and was happy. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) family about, meals were never so pleasant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
loathed a fork: it is a modern introduction which has still scarcely
reached common people. What Morel preferred was a clasp-knife. Then, in
solitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) ate and drank, often sitting, in cold weather, on a little
stool with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) back to the warm chimney-piece, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) food on the fender,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cup on the hearth. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) read the last night's newspaper--what
of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could--spelling it over laboriously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) preferred to keep the
blinds down and the candle lit even when it was daylight; it was the
habit of the mine.

<p/>At a quarter to six he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rose, cut two thick slices of bread and butter,
and put them in the white calico snap-bag. He (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) filled his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) tin bottle with
tea. Cold tea without milk or sugar was the drink he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) preferred for the
pit. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) shirt, and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) pit-singlet, a vest
of thick flannel cut low round the neck, and with short sleeves like a
chemise.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) went upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) wife with a cup of tea because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was ill,
and because it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've brought thee a cup o' tea, lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you needn't, for you know I don't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink it up; it'll pop thee off to sleep again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) accepted the tea. It pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) take it and sip it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll back my life there's no sugar in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yi--there's one big `un,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) replied, injured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, sipping again.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had a winsome face when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair was loose. He (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to grumble
at him (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) in this manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again, and went, without any
sort of leave-taking. He (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) never took more than two slices of bread and
butter to eat in the pit, so an apple or an orange was a treat to him (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) always liked it when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put one out for him (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) tied a scarf round
his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) neck, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) great, heavy boots, his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) coat, with the big pocket,
that carried his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) snap-bag and his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) bottle of tea, and went forth into
the fresh morning air, closing, without locking, the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>)
loved the early morning, and the walk across the fields. So he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) appeared
at the pit-top, often with a stalk from the hedge between his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) teeth,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) chewed all day to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) mouth moist, down the mine, feeling
quite as happy as when he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) was in the field.

<p/>Later, when the time for the baby grew nearer, he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) would bustle round
in his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) slovenly fashion, poking out the ashes, rubbing the fireplace,
sweeping the house before he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) went to work. Then, feeling very
self-righteous, he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) went upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I'm cleaned up for thee: tha's no `casions ter stir a peg all day,
but sit and read thy books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Which made her (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) laugh, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the dinner cooks itself?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I know nowt about th' dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd know if there weren't any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, `appen so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) answered, departing.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) got downstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) would find the house tidy, but dirty. She (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>)
could not rest until she (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) had thoroughly cleaned; so she (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) went down to the
ash-pit with her (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) dustpan. Mrs. Kirk, spying her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>), would contrive to have
to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) own coal-place at that minute. Then, across the wooden
fence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) would call:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you keep wagging on, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Morel deprecatingly. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing else for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Hose?''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>called a very small woman from across the road. It
was Mrs. Anthony, a black-haired, strange little body, who always wore a
brown velvet dress, tight fitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>)'d come. I've got a copperful of clothes, an' I'm sure I
heered his (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) bell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark! He (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>)'s at the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div><p/>The two women looked down the alley. At the end of the Bottoms a
man stood in a sort of old-fashioned trap, bending over bundles of
cream-coloured stuff; while a cluster of women held up their arms to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), some with bundles. Mrs. Anthony herself had a heap of creamy,
undyed stockings hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've done ten dozen this week,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) said proudly to Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``T-t-t!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went the other. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how you can find time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Anthony/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Anthony. <div class="bookquote">``You can find time if you make time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how you do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``And how much shall you
get for those many?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tuppence-ha`penny a dozen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I'd starve before I'd sit down and seam
twenty-four stockings for twopence ha`penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Anthony/Anthony</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Anthony. <div class="bookquote">``You can rip along with 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Hose was coming along, ringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bell. Women were waiting at the
yard-ends with their seamed stockings hanging over their arms. The
man, a common fellow, made jokes with them, tried to swindle them, and
bullied them. Mrs. Morel went up her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) yard disdainfully.

<p/>It was an understood thing that if one woman wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbour, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
should put the poker in the fire and bang at the back of the fireplace,
which, as the fires were back to back, would make a great noise in the
adjoining house. One morning Mrs. Kirk, mixing a pudding, nearly started
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) skin as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) heard the thud, thud, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) grate. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>)
hands all floury, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) rushed to the fence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you knock, Mrs. Morel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wouldn't mind, Mrs. Kirk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirk</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Kirk climbed on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) copper, got over the wall on to Mrs. Morel's
copper, and ran in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) neighbour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, dear, how are you feeling?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried in concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might fetch Mrs. Bower,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>Mrs. Kirk went into the yard, lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) strong, shrill voice, and
called:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ag-gie--Ag-gie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirk</b></font>)</div><p/>The sound was heard from one end of the Bottoms to the other. At last
Aggie came running up, and was sent for Mrs. Bower, whilst Mrs. Kirk
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) pudding and stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) neighbour.

<p/>Mrs. Morel went to bed. Mrs. Kirk had Annie and William for dinner. Mrs.
Bower, fat and waddling, bossed the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hash some cold meat up for the master's dinner, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) an
apple-charlotte pudding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) may go without pudding this day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bower</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bower.

<p/>Morel was not as a rule one of the first to appear at the bottom of the
pit, ready to come up. Some men were there before four o'clock, when the
whistle blew loose-all; but Morel, whose stall, a poor one, was at this
time about a mile and a half away from the bottom, worked usually till
the first mate stopped, then he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) finished also. This day, however, the
miner was sick of the work. At two o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) watch, by
the light of the green candle--he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) was in a safe working--and again at
half-past two. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) was hewing at a piece of rock that was in the way for
the next day's work. As he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) heels, or kneeled, giving hard
blows with his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) pick, <div class="bookquote">``Uszza--uszza!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall ter finish, Sorry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Barker</b></font>)</div>cried Barker, his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) fellow butty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Finish? Niver while the world stands!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>growled Morel.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) went on striking. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) was tired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a heart-breaking job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barker</b></font>)</div>said Barker.

<p/>But Morel was too exasperated, at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) tether, to answer.
Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) struck and hacked with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha might as well leave it, Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barker</b></font>)</div>said Barker. <div class="bookquote">``It'll do to-morrow,
without thee hackin' thy guts out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll lay no b-- finger on this to-morrow, Isr`el!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, if tha wunna, somebody else'll ha'e to,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Israel.

<p/>Then Morel continued to strike.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey-up there--LOOSE-A'!''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>cried the men, leaving the next stall.

<p/>Morel continued to strike.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha'll happen catch me up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barker</b></font>)</div>said Barker, departing.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) had gone, Morel, left alone, felt savage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) had not finished
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) job. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) had overworked himself into a frenzy. Rising, wet with
sweat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) tool down, pulled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) coat, blew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) candle,
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) lamp, and went. Down the main road the lights of the other men
went swinging. There was a hollow sound of many voices. It was a long,
heavy tramp underground.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) sat at the bottom of the pit, where the great drops of water fell
plash. Many colliers were waiting their turns to go up, talking noisily.
Morel gave his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) answers short and disagreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's rainin', Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles</b></font>)</div>said old Giles, who had had the news from the
top.

<p/>Morel found one comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) old umbrella, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) loved, in the
lamp cabin. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) stand on the chair, and was at the top
in a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) handed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) lamp and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) umbrella, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
had bought at an auction for one-and-six. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) stood on the edge of
the pit-bank for a moment, looking out over the fields; grey rain was
falling. The trucks stood full of wet, bright coal. Water ran down the
sides of the waggons, over the white <div class="bookquote">``C.W. and Co.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>. Colliers, walking
indifferent to the rain, were streaming down the line and up the field,
a grey, dismal host. Morel put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) umbrella, and took pleasure from
the peppering of the drops thereon.

<p/>All along the road to Bestwood the miners tramped, wet and grey and
dirty, but their red mouths talking with animation. Morel also walked
with a gang, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) frowned peevishly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) went. Many
men passed into the Prince of Wales or into Ellen's. Morel, feeling
sufficiently disagreeable to resist temptation, trudged along under
the dripping trees that overhung the park wall, and down the mud of
Greenhill Lane.

<p/>Mrs. Morel lay in bed, listening to the rain, and the feet of the
colliers from Minton, their voices, and the bang, bang of the gates as
they went through the stile up the field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some herb beer behind the pantry door,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Th'
master'll want a drink, if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) doesn't stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) was late, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) concluded he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) had called for a drink, since it
was raining. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) care about the child or her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was very ill when her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) children were born.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked, feeling sick to death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took consolation in that. The thought of being the mother of men
was warming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked at the child. It had blue eyes,
and a lot of fair hair, and was bonny. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) love came up hot, in spite of
everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had it in bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>Morel, thinking nothing, dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) way up the garden path, wearily
and angrily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) umbrella, and stood it in the sink; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>)
sluthered his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) heavy boots into the kitchen. Mrs. Bower appeared in the
inner doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bower</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s about as bad as she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can be. It's a boy childt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The miner grunted, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) empty snap-bag and his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) tin bottle on the
dresser, went back into the scullery and hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) coat, then came and
dropped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Han yer got a drink?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) asked.

<p/>The woman went into the pantry. There was heard the pop of a cork. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
set the mug, with a little, disgusted rap, on the table before Morel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>)
drank, gasped, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) big moustache on the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) scarf, drank,
gasped, and lay back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) chair. The woman would not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>)
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) dinner before him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>), and went upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that the master?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've gave him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bower</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bower.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) had sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) arms on the table--he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) resented the fact that
Mrs. Bower put no cloth on for him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>), and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) a little plate, instead
of a full-sized dinner-plate--he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) began to eat. The fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) wife
was ill, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) had another boy, was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) at that moment.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) was too tired; he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) dinner; he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) wanted to sit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) arms
lying on the board; he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) did not like having Mrs. Bower about. The fire
was too small to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>).

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) meal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) sat for twenty minutes; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>)
stoked up a big fire. Then, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) stockinged feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) went reluctantly
upstairs. It was a struggle to face his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) wife at this moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) was
tired. His (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) face was black, and smeared with sweat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) singlet had
dried again, soaking the dirt in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) had a dirty woollen scarf round his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>)
throat. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) stood at the foot of the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how are ter, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) stood at a loss what to say next. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) was tired, and this bother was
rather a nuisance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) didn't quite know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A lad, tha says,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) stammered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned down the sheet and showed the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) murmured. Which made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) laugh, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) blessed by
rote--pretending paternal emotion, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) did not feel just then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, my lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) answered, turning away.

<p/>Dismissed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) wanted to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) dared not. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) half wanted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but could not bring herself to give any sign. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) only
breathed freely when he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) was gone out of the room again, leaving behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) a faint smell of pit-dirt.

<p/>Mrs. Morel had a visit every day from the Congregational clergyman. Mr.
Heaton was young, and very poor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) wife had died at the birth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>)
first baby, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) remained alone in the manse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) was a Bachelor of Arts
of Cambridge, very shy, and no preacher. Mrs. Morel was fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). For hours he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was well. He (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>)
became the god-parent of the child.

<p/>Occasionally the minister stayed to tea with Mrs. Morel. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) laid
the cloth early, got out her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) best cups, with a little green rim, and
hoped Morel would not come too soon; indeed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) stayed for a pint,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would not mind this day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had always two dinners to cook, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) believed children should have their chief meal at midday, whereas
Morel needed his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) at five o'clock. So Mr. Heaton would hold the baby,
whilst Mrs. Morel beat up a batter-pudding or peeled the potatoes, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>), watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) all the time, would discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) next sermon. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) ideas
were quaint and fantastic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) judiciously to earth. It was
a discussion of the wedding at Cana.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) changed the water into wine at Cana,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that is a
symbol that the ordinary life, even the blood, of the married husband
and wife, which had before been uninspired, like water, became filled
with the Spirit, and was as wine, because, when love enters, the whole
spiritual constitution of a man changes, is filled with the Holy Ghost,
and almost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) form is altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel thought to herself:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, poor fellow, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young wife is dead; that is why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love
into the Holy Ghost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>They were halfway down their first cup of tea when they heard the
sluther of pit-boots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Morel, in spite of herself.

<p/>The minister looked rather scared. Morel entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) was feeling rather
savage. He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) nodded a <div class="bookquote">``How d'yer do''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to the clergyman, who rose to shake
hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``look thee at it! Tha niver
wants ter shake hands wi' a hand like that, does ter? There's too much
pick-haft and shovel-dirt on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>The minister flushed with confusion, and sat down again. Mrs. Morel
rose, carried out the steaming saucepan. Morel took off his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) coat,
dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) armchair to table, and sat down heavily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you tired?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>asked the clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tired? I ham that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Morel. ``YOU don't know what it is to be
tired, as I<div class="bookquote">``M tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>replied the clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, look yer `ere,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>said the miner, showing the shoulders of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
singlet. <div class="bookquote">``It's a bit dry now, but it's wet as a clout with sweat even
yet. Feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Heaton doesn't want to feel your
nasty singlet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/>The clergyman put out his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) hand gingerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) doesn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel; ``but it's all come out of me,
whether or not. An' iv`ry day alike my singlet's wringin' wet. <div class="bookquote">``Aven't
you got a drink, Missis, for a man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes home barkled up from
the pit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you drank all the beer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, pouring out his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' was there no more to be got?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>Turning to the clergyman--<div class="bookquote">``A man gets
that caked up wi' th' dust, you know,--that clogged up down a coal-mine,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) NEEDS a drink when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>said the clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's ten to one if there's owt for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's water--and there's tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Water! It's not water as'll clear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) poured out a saucerful of tea, blew it, and sucked it up through his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
great black moustache, sighing afterwards. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) poured out another
saucerful, and stood his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) cup on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My cloth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, putting it on a plate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man as comes home as I do 's too tired to care about cloths,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said
Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wife, sarcastically.

<p/>The room was full of the smell of meat and vegetables and pit-clothes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) leaned over to the minister, his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) great moustache thrust forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
mouth very red in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) black face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Heaton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``a man as has been down the black hole all day,
dingin' away at a coal-face, yi, a sight harder than that wall--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Needn't make a moan of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>put in Mrs. Morel.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband because, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had an audience, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) whined
and played for sympathy. William, sitting nursing the baby, hated him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>),
with a boy's hatred for false sentiment, and for the stupid treatment of
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother. Annie had never liked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) merely avoided him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>When the minister had gone, Mrs. Morel looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fine mess!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dos't think I'm goin' to sit wi' my arms danglin', cos tha's got a
parson for tea wi' thee?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) bawled.

<p/>They were both angry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said nothing. The baby began to cry, and
Mrs. Morel, picking up a saucepan from the hearth, accidentally knocked
Annie on the head, whereupon the girl began to whine, and Morel to shout
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). In the midst of this pandemonium, William looked up at the big
glazed text over the mantelpiece and read distinctly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God Bless Our Home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>Whereupon Mrs. Morel, trying to soothe the baby, jumped up, rushed at
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), boxed his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) ears, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are YOU putting in for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat down and laughed, till tears ran over her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cheeks, while
William kicked the stool he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been sitting on, and Morel growled:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I canna see what there is so much to laugh at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>One evening, directly after the parson's visit, feeling unable to bear
herself after another display from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took Annie and the
baby and went out. Morel had kicked William, and the mother would never
forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went over the sheep-bridge and across a corner of the meadow to the
cricket-ground. The meadows seemed one space of ripe, evening light,
whispering with the distant mill-race. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat on a seat under the
alders in the cricket-ground, and fronted the evening. Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), level
and solid, spread the big green cricket-field, like the bed of a sea of
light. Children played in the bluish shadow of the pavilion. Many rooks,
high up, came cawing home across the softly-woven sky. They stooped in
a long curve down into the golden glow, concentrating, cawing, wheeling,
like black flakes on a slow vortex, over a tree clump that made a dark
boss among the pasture.

<p/>A few gentlemen were practising, and Mrs. Morel could hear the chock
of the ball, and the voices of men suddenly roused; could see the white
forms of men shifting silently over the green, upon which already the
under shadows were smouldering. Away at the grange, one side of the
haystacks was lit up, the other sides blue-grey. A waggon of sheaves
rocked small across the melting yellow light.

<p/>The sun was going down. Every open evening, the hills of Derbyshire were
blazed over with red sunset. Mrs. Morel watched the sun sink from the
glistening sky, leaving a soft flower-blue overhead, while the western
space went red, as if all the fire had swum down there, leaving the
bell cast flawless blue. The mountain-ash berries across the field stood
fierily out from the dark leaves, for a moment. A few shocks of corn in
a corner of the fallow stood up as if alive; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) imagined them bowing;
perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son would be a Joseph. In the east, a mirrored sunset
floated pink opposite the west's scarlet. The big haystacks on the
hillside, that butted into the glare, went cold.

<p/>With Mrs. Morel it was one of those still moments when the small frets
vanish, and the beauty of things stands out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had the peace and
the strength to see herself. Now and again, a swallow cut close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).
Now and again, Annie came up with a handful of alder-currants. The baby
was restless on his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) mother's knee, clambering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) hands at the
light.

<p/>Mrs. Morel looked down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had dreaded this baby like a
catastrophe, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt
strangely towards the infant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart was heavy because of the child,
almost as if it were unhealthy, or malformed. Yet it seemed quite well.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) noticed the peculiar knitting of the baby's brows, and the
peculiar heaviness of its eyes, as if it were trying to understand
something that was pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) child's dark,
brooding pupils, as if a burden were on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was thinking about something--quite sorrowful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirk</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Kirk.

<p/>Suddenly, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), the heavy feeling at the mother's heart melted
into passionate grief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) bowed over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and a few tears shook swiftly
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) very heart. The baby lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lamb!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) cried softly.

<p/>And at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) felt, in some far inner place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) soul, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) husband were guilty.

<p/>The baby was looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>). It had blue eyes like her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) own, but its
look was heavy, steady, as if it had realised something that had stunned
some point of its soul.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) arms lay the delicate baby. Its deep blue eyes, always looking up
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) unblinking, seemed to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) innermost thoughts out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>)
no longer loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) husband; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) had not wanted this child to come, and
there it lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) arms and pulled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) felt as if the
navel string that had connected its frail little body with hers had not
been broken. A wave of hot love went over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) to the infant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) held it
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) face and breast. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) force, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) soul she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>)
would make up to it for having brought it into the world unloved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>)
would love it all the more now it was here; carry it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) love. Its
clear, knowing eyes gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) pain and fear. Did it know all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>)?
When it lay under her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) heart, had it been listening then? Was there a
reproach in the look? She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) felt the marrow melt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) bones, with fear
and pain.

<p/>Once more she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) was aware of the sun lying red on the rim of the hill
opposite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) suddenly held up the child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Look, my pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) thrust the infant forward to the crimson, throbbing sun, almost with
relief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) little fist. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) bosom
again, ashamed almost of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) impulse to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) back again whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>)
came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) thought to herself, <div class="bookquote">``what will become of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--what
will he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) heart was anxious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will call him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) said suddenly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) knew not why.

<p/>After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) went home. A fine shadow was flung over the deep green
meadow, darkening all.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) expected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) found the house empty. But Morel was home by ten
o'clock, and that day, at least, ended peacefully.

<p/>Walter Morel was, at this time, exceedingly irritable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) work seemed
to exhaust him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came home he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not speak civilly to anybody.
If the fire were rather low he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bullied about that; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) grumbled about his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
dinner; if the children made a chatter he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shouted at them in a way that
made their mother's blood boil, and made them hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>On the Friday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby was unwell,
and was restless, crying if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were put down. Mrs. Morel, tired to
death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish the nuisance would come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said wearily to herself.

<p/>The child at last sank down to sleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was too tired to
carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to the cradle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll say nothing, whatever time he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It only works
me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does anything it'll make
my blood boil,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) added to herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sighed, hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) coming, as if it were something she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not
bear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) revenge, was nearly drunk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head
bent over the child as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) entered, not wishing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). But it
went through her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) like a flash of hot fire when, in passing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lurched
against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched at the
white pot knobs for support. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hat and coat, then returned,
stood glowering from a distance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat bowed over the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there nothing to eat in the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked, insolently, as if to a
servant. In certain stages of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) intoxication he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) affected the
clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) most in this
condition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what there is in the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, so coldly, it sounded
impersonal.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stood and glared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) without moving a muscle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said
affectedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, still ignoring him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) glowered again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came unsteadily forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) leaned on the
table with one hand, and with the other jerked at the table drawer to
get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pulled sideways.
In a temper he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dragged it, so that it flew out bodily, and spoons,
forks, knives, a hundred metallic things, splashed with a clatter and a
clang upon the brick floor. The baby gave a little convulsed start.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the mother cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up, like
other women have to, an' wait on a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait on you--wait on you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I see myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha sh`lt wait
on me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was trying to fit in the drawer. At her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) turned round.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face was crimson, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes bloodshot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) one silent
second in threat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P-h!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went quickly, in contempt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) jerked at the drawer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) excitement. It fell, cut sharply on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
shin, and on the reflex he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) flung it at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>One of the corners caught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brow as the shallow drawer crashed into
the fireplace. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) swayed, almost fell stunned from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chair. To her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
very soul she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sick; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) clasped the child tightly to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bosom. A
few moments elapsed; then, with an effort, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brought herself to.
The baby was crying plaintively. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left brow was bleeding rather
profusely. As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) glanced down at the child, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brain reeling, some
drops of blood soaked into its white shawl; but the baby was at least
not hurt. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) balanced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head to keep equilibrium, so that the blood
ran into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Walter Morel remained as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had stood, leaning on the table with one
hand, looking blank. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was sufficiently sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) balance,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went across to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), swayed, caught hold of the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
rocking-chair, almost tipping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) out; then leaning forward over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and swaying as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, in a tone of wondering concern:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did it catch thee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) swayed again, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would pitch on to the child. With the
catastrophe he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had lost all balance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, struggling to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) presence of mind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hiccoughed. <div class="bookquote">``Let's--let's look at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, hiccoughing again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lemme--lemme look at it, lass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) of drink, felt the unequal pull of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) swaying grasp on
the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rocking-chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, and weakly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) off.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Summoning all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
strength she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,
moving as if in sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went across to the scullery, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bathed
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eye for a minute in cold water; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was too dizzy. Afraid lest
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should swoon, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rocking-chair, trembling in every
fibre. By instinct, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kept the baby clasped.

<p/>Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back into its
cavity, and was on his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knees, groping, with numb paws, for the scattered
spoons.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came craning his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
neck towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has it done to thee, lass?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked, in a very wretched, humble
tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can see what it's done,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood, bending forward, supported on his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands, which grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
legs just above the knee. He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) peered to look at the wound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) drew away
from the thrust of his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face with its great moustache, averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
own face as much as possible. As he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), who was cold and
impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight, he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sickened with feebleness
and hopelessness of spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was turning drearily away, when he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw
a drop of blood fall from the averted wound into the baby's fragile,
glistening hair. Fascinated, he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) watched the heavy dark drop hang in
the glistening cloud, and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It
would soak through to the baby's scalp. He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) watched, fascinated, feeling
it soak in; then, finally, his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) manhood broke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What of this child?''  (<font color='red'><b>all wife</b></font>)</div>was all his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wife said to him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) low, intense
tones brought his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head lower. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) softened: <div class="bookquote">``Get me some wadding out of
the middle drawer,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a pad, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) singed before the fire, then put on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) forehead, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat with
the baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that clean pit-scarf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently with a
red, narrow scarf. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took it, and with trembling fingers proceeded to
bind it round her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me tie it for thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said humbly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can do it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) replied. When it was done she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went upstairs,
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to rake the fire and lock the door.

<p/>In the morning Mrs. Morel said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I was getting a
raker in the dark, because the candle blew out.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) two small children
looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) with wide, dismayed eyes. They said nothing, but their
parted lips seemed to express the unconscious tragedy they felt.

<p/>Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not
think of the previous evening's work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) scarcely thought of anything,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would not think of that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lay and suffered like a sulking dog.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had hurt himself most; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was the more damaged because he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would
never say a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), or express his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tried to wriggle out
of it. <div class="bookquote">``It was her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) own fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to himself. Nothing, however,
could prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) inner consciousness inflicting on him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) the punishment
which ate into his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) spirit like rust, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could only alleviate
by drinking.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word, or
to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had himself violent
pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rose, cut himself
food in the pantry, ate it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head dropped, then pulled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock slightly tipsy and
relieved; then once more straight to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rose again at six in the
evening, had tea and went straight out.

<p/>Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till 2.30,
dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel went upstairs,
towards four o'clock, to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) Sunday dress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was fast asleep.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would have felt sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had once said, <div class="bookquote">``Wife, I'm
sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But no; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) insisted to himself it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) fault. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
broke himself. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) merely left him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) alone. There was this deadlock of
passion between them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was stronger.

<p/>The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat down to meals
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't my father going to get up?''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>asked William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the mother replied.

<p/>There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children breathed
the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were rather
disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.

<p/>Immediately Morel woke he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got straight out of bed. That was
characteristic of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was all for activity. The
prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>It was near six o'clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got down. This time he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) entered without
hesitation, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wincing sensitiveness having hardened again. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not
care any longer what the family thought or felt.

<p/>The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud from <div class="bookquote">``The
Child's Own'' (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>, Annie listening and asking eternally <div class="bookquote">``why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Both children
hushed into silence as they heard the approaching thud of their father's
stockinged feet, and shrank as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was usually indulgent
to them.

<p/>Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ate and drank more noisily than
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had need. No one spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The family life withdrew, shrank
away, and became hushed as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cared no longer about his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
alienation.

<p/>Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had finished tea he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rose with alacrity to go out. It was
this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened Mrs. Morel. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sousing heartily in cold water, heard the eager scratch
of the steel comb on the side of the bowl, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wetted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes in disgust. As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bent over, lacing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) boots, there
was a certain vulgar gusto in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) movement that divided him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from the
reserved, watchful rest of the family. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always ran away from the
battle with himself. Even in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own heart's privacy, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) excused
himself, saying, <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) hadn't said so-and-so, it would never have
happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) asked for what she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)'s got.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The children waited in
restraint during his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preparations. When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gone, they sighed with
relief.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and was glad. It was a rainy evening. The
Palmerston would be the cosier. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hastened forward in anticipation. All
the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone black with wet. The roads, always
dark with coal-dust, were full of blackish mud. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hastened along. The
Palmerston windows were steamed over. The passage was paddled with wet
feet. But the air was warm, if foul, and full of the sound of voices and
the smell of beer and smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shollt ha'e, Walter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried a voice, as soon as Morel appeared in
the doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men made a seat for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and took him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in warmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was glad. In a
minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), all shame,
all trouble, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was clear as a bell for a jolly night.

<p/>On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife.
Having hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know what to do with
himself that evening, having not even twopence with which to go to the
Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt. So, while his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife
was down the garden with the child, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hunted in the top drawer of
the dresser where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) purse, found it, and looked inside. It
contained a half-crown, two halfpennies, and a sixpence. So he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took the
sixpence, put the purse carefully back, and went out.

<p/>The next day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted to pay the greengrocer, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked in the
purse for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sixpence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart sank to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shoes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat
down and thought: <div class="bookquote">``WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't spent it, had I? And I
hadn't left it anywhere else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was much put about. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hunted round everywhere for it. And, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
sought, the conviction came into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband had taken
it. What she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) purse was all the money she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) possessed. But that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should sneak it from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thus was unbearable. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had done so twice
before. The first time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not accused him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and at the week-end he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had put the shilling again into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) purse. So that was how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had known
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had taken it. The second time he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not paid back.

<p/>This time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt it was too much. When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dinner--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came
home early that day--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) coldly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, looking up in an offended way. <div class="bookquote">``No, I didna! I niver
clapped eyes on your purse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could detect the lie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you know you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you I didna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Yer at me again, are yer? I've had
about enough on't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking the clothes in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll may yer pay for this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, pushing back his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chair in
desperation. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bustled and got washed, then went determinedly upstairs.
Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came down dressed, and with a big bundle in a blue-checked,
enormous handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you'll see me again when you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be before I want to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) replied; and at that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) marched out
of the house with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bundle. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat trembling slightly, but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart
brimming with contempt. What would she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) do if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went to some other
pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman? But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) too
well--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) couldn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dead sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Nevertheless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart was
gnawed inside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's my dad?''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William, coming in from school.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s run away,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>replied the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief, and
says he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s not coming back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, never trouble, he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) won't go far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) doesn't come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>wailed Annie.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel sat and
laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You pair of gabeys!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``You'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) before the night's
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on. Mrs. Morel
grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said it would be a
relief to see the last of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); another part fretted because of keeping
the children; and inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), as yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not quite let him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) go. At
the bottom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew very well he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could NOT go.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden, however,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt something behind the door. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked. And there in the dark
lay the big blue bundle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat on a piece of coal and laughed. Every
time she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw it, so fat and yet so ignominious, slunk into its corner in
the dark, with its ends flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
laughed again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was relieved.

<p/>Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had not any money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew, so if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stopped
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was running up a bill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was very tired of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)--tired to death. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had not even the courage to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) bundle beyond the yard-end.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) meditated, at about nine o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) opened the door and came in,
slinking, and yet sulky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said not a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) coat, and
slunk to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) armchair, where he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) began to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may thank your stars I've come back to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, looking up
from under his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your parcel
through the yard-end,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked such a fool she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was not even angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) continued to
take his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boots off and prepare for bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But if you
leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got up and went out of the house, returning presently and
crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs. As Mrs. Morel
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) slink quickly through the inner doorway, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) bundle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
laughed to herself: but her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart was bitter, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>THE CASTING OFF OF MOREL--THE TAKING ON OF WILLIAM

<p/>DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable. Like all
miners, he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) was a great lover of medicines, which, strangely enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>)
would often pay for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a winder as we
canna ha'e a sup i' th' `ouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>So Mrs. Morel bought him (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) elixir of vitriol, his (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) favourite first
medicine. And he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) had hanging in
the attic great bunches of dried herbs: wormwood, rue, horehound, elder
flowers, parsley-purt, marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury.
Usually there was a jug of one or other decoction standing on the hob,
from which he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) drank largely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grand!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) said, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) lips after wormwood. <div class="bookquote">``Grand!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>)
exhorted the children to try.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) vowed. But
they were not to be tempted.

<p/>This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) herbs would
shift the <div class="bookquote">``nasty peens in his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) head'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>. He (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) was sickening for an attack of
an inflammation of the brain. He (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) had never been well since his (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) sleeping
on the ground when he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) went with Jerry to Nottingham. Since then he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) had
drunk and stormed. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) fell seriously ill, and Mrs. Morel had him (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>)
to nurse. He (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) was one of the worst patients imaginable. But, in spite of
all, and putting aside the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) was breadwinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) never
quite wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) to die. Still there was one part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) for
herself.

<p/>The neighbours were very good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>): occasionally some had the children
in to meals, occasionally some would do the downstairs work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), one
would mind the baby for a day. But it was a great drag, nevertheless.
It was not every day the neighbours helped. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had nursing of baby
and husband, cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was quite worn
out, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did what was wanted of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>And the money was just sufficient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had seventeen shillings a week
from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other butty put by a portion
of the stall's profits for Morel's wife. And the neighbours made broths,
and gave eggs, and such invalids' trifles. If they had not helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) so
generously in those times, Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through,
without incurring debts that would have dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) down.

<p/>The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) had a fine
constitution, so that, once on the mend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) went straight forward to
recovery. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) was pottering about downstairs. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) illness his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>)
wife had spoilt him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) a little. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to continue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) often
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) band to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) head, pulled down the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) mouth, and
shammed pains he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) did not feel. But there was no deceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). At first
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) merely smiled to herself. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>That wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) slightly, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) continued to feign sickness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be such a mardy baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife shortly.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) was indignant, and cursed under his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) breath, like a boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) was
forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

<p/>Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>), depending on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was more tolerant
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) less. Up till this time, in spite of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) had
been her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had felt that, more or less, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>)
did to himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) did to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) living depended on him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>). There were
many, many stages in the ebbing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>), but it was always
ebbing.

<p/>Now, with the birth of this third baby, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) self no longer set towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>), helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose, standing off
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>). After this she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) scarcely desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>). And, standing more aloof
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>), not feeling him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) so much part of herself, but merely part of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not mind so much what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) did, could leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>)
alone.

<p/>There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year, which
is like autumn in a man's life. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife was casting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off, half
regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off and turning now for love
and life to the children. Henceforward he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was more or less a husk. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself acquiesced, as so many men do, yielding their place to their
children.

<p/>During his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recuperation, when it was really over between them, both made
an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship of the first
months of their marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat at home and, when the children were in
bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was sewing--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sewing by hand, made all shirts
and children's clothing--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would read to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from the newspaper, slowly
pronouncing and delivering the words like a man pitching quoits. Often
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a phrase in anticipation. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) words humbly.

<p/>The silences between them were peculiar. There would be the swift,
slight <div class="bookquote">``cluck''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) needle, the sharp <div class="bookquote">``pop''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let out
the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spat in the fire.
Then her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thoughts turned to William. Already he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was getting a big boy.
Already he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was top of the class, and the master said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was the smartest
lad in the school. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a man, young, full of vigour, making the
world glow again for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing to think about,
would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soul would reach out in its
blind way to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and find her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt a sort of emptiness, almost
like a vacuum in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was unsettled and restless. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could
not live in that atmosphere, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) affected his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wife. Both felt an
oppression on their breathing when they were left together for some
time. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went to bed and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

<p/>Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace and
tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen months old
when the new baby was born. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was then a plump, pale child, quiet, with
heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar slight knitting of the brows.
The last child was also a boy, fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was with child, both for economic reasons and because she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband; but not for the sake of the infant.

<p/>They called the baby Arthur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was very pretty, with a mop of gold
curls, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father from the first. Mrs. Morel was glad this
child loved the father. Hearing the miner's footsteps, the baby would
put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arms and crow. And if Morel were in a good temper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) called
back immediately, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hearty, mellow voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would put an
apron round the child, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a sight the lad looks!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would exclaim sometimes, taking back
the baby, that was smutted on the face from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father's kisses and
play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s a little collier, bless his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bit o' mutton!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>And these were the happy moments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) life now, when the children
included the father in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active, while Paul,
always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer, and trotted after his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mother like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was usually active and interested, but
sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have fits of depression. Then the mother would find
the boy of three or four crying on the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked, and got no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) insisted, getting cross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>sobbed the child.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tried to reason him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out of it, or to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but without
effect. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feel beside herself. Then the father, always
impatient, would jump from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair and shout:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) doesn't stop, I'll smack him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll do nothing of the sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother coldly. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
carried the child into the yard, plumped him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little chair, and
said: <div class="bookquote">``Now cry there, Misery!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eye, or
at last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often, but they
caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) treatment of Paul was
different from that of the other children.

<p/>Suddenly one morning as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was looking down the alley of the Bottoms
for the barm-man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heard a voice calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). It was the thin little
Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A lad as gets `old of another an' rips his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) clothes off'n `is back,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Anthony/Anthony</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Anthony said, <div class="bookquote">``wants showing something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Anthony/Anthony</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your Alfred's as old as my William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a right to get hold of the

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``I don't thrash my children, and even if I did,
I should want to hear their side of the tale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Anthony/Anthony</b></font>)</div>retorted
Mrs. Anthony. <div class="bookquote">``When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean collar off'n `is
back a-purpose--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) didn't do it on purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make me a liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Anthony/Anthony</b></font>)</div>shouted Mrs. Anthony.

<p/>Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) gate. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mug of barm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I s'll let your mester know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Anthony/Anthony</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Anthony cried after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>).

<p/>At dinner-time, when William had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) meal and wanted to be off
again--he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was then eleven years old--his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother said to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did I tear his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) collar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you tore it more.''

collar. But I got my cobbler--''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) pulled from his (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on a
string. This old cobbler had <div class="bookquote">``cobbled'' (<font color='red'><b>This cobbler</b></font>)</div>--hit and smashed--seventeen other
cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) veteran.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``you know you've got no right to rip his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
collar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, our mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I never meant tr'a done it--an' it was
on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a`ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next time,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``YOU be more careful. I shouldn't like it
if you came home with your collar torn off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--well, you be more careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel, who hated any
bother with the neighbours, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would explain to Mrs. Anthony,
and the business would be over.

<p/>But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood
in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for some minutes.
Then:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wheer's that Willy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want HIM for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll let `im know when I get him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel, banging his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pit-bottle
on to the dresser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning to you about
Alfy's collar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Niver mind who's got hold of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel. ``When I get hold of <div class="bookquote">``IM
I'll make his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) bones rattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a poor tale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``that you're so ready to side
with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales against your own
children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll learn `im!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``It none matters to me whose lad 'e is;
`e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s a mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ripping and tearing about!'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was running
after that Alfy, who'd taken his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) cobbler, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) accidentally got hold
of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) collar, because the other dodged--as an Anthony would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>shouted Morel threateningly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would, before you're told,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife bitingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Niver you mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>stormed Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I know my business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's more than doubtful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>repeated Morel.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said no more, but sat and nursed his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) bad temper. Suddenly William
ran in, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I have my tea, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha can ha'e more than that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>shouted Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your noise, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel; <div class="bookquote">``and don't look so ridiculous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>shouted Morel, rising
from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) chair and glaring at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son.

<p/>William, who was a tall lad for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) years, but very sensitive, had gone
pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son.

<p/>William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fist, and
crouched.

<p/>``I'll GI<div class="bookquote">``E him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) `go out'!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shouted like an insane thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. <div class="bookquote">``You shall not touch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
for HER telling, you shall not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shonna I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>shouted Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Shonna I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>And, glaring at the boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang in between
them, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) fist lifted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you DARE!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shouted, baffled for the moment. <div class="bookquote">``What!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) spun round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``GO out of the house!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in fury.

<p/>The boy, as if hypnotised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), turned suddenly and was gone. Morel
rushed to the door, but was too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) returned, pale under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
pit-dirt with fury. But now his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wife was fully roused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only dare!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said in a loud, ringing voice. <div class="bookquote">``Only dare, milord, to
lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). In a towering rage, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sat down.

<p/>When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel joined
the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached to the
Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night in the long
room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood <div class="bookquote">``Co-op'' (<font color='red'><b>Bestwood</b></font>)</div>. The women were
supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from co-operation, and
other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel read a paper. It seemed
queer to the children to see their mother, who was always busy about
the house, sitting writing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rapid fashion, thinking, referring
to books, and writing again. They felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) on such occasions the
deepest respect.

<p/>But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they did not
grudge their mother--and that partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) enjoyed it, partly
because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild was called by some
hostile husbands, who found their wives getting too independent, the
<div class="bookquote">``clat-fart''  (<font color='red'><b>wives</b></font>)</div>shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It is true, from off
the basis of the Guild, the women could look at their homes, at the
conditions of their own lives, and find fault. So the colliers found
their women had a new standard of their own, rather disconcerting. And
also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news on Monday nights, so that the
children liked William to be in when their mother came home, because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
told him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) things.

<p/>Then, when the lad was thirteen, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a job in the <div class="bookquote">``Co-op.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>office. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was a very clever boy, frank, with rather rough features and
real viking blue eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on `im for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel.
<div class="bookquote">``All he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'ll do is to wear his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) britches behind out an' earn nowt. What's
'e startin' wi'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s starting with,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldna! Put `im i' th' pit we me, an' `ell earn a easy ten shillin'
a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) truck-end out on a
stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi`me, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is NOT going in the pit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``and there's an end of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for `im.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason why I
should do the same with my lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was very proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went to the night school, and learned
shorthand, so that by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was sixteen he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was the best shorthand
clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) taught in the
night schools. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was so fiery that only his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) good-nature and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
size protected him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).

<p/>All the things that men do--the decent things--William did. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could
run like the wind. When he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was twelve he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) won a first prize in a race;
an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil. It stood proudly on the
dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure. The boy only ran for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flew home with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) anvil, breathless, with a <div class="bookquote">``Look, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>That was
the first real tribute to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took it like a queen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to get ambitious. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gave all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) money to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) earned fourteen shillings a week, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back two for
himself, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never drank, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt himself rich. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went about
with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained nothing higher
than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager, then the doctors, then
the tradespeople, and after that the hosts of colliers. Willam began
to consort with the sons of the chemist, the schoolmaster, and
the tradesmen. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) played billiards in the Mechanics' Hall. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)
danced--this in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) mother. All the life that Bestwood offered
he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops down Church Street, to sports and
billiards.

<p/>Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of flower-like
ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's heart for a
brief fortnight.

<p/>Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) errant swain. Mrs.
Morel would find a strange girl at the door, and immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sniffed
the air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Morel in?''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>the damsel would ask appealingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband is at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated the maiden painfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which one? There are several.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--at a dance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances. And he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is NOT at
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) came home angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) mother for having turned the girl away
so rudely. He (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow, who walked with
long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) cap pushed jollily to
the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) head. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) came in frowning. He (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) cap on to
the sofa, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) strong jaw in his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) hand, and glared down at
his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was small, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hair taken straight back from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
forehead. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a quiet air of authority, and yet of rare warmth.
Knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son was angry, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trembled inwardly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why didn't you tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I forgot, simply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fumed a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Big brown eyes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're running
after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you. Tell them
that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a nice girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wasn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great strife
between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its height when
William said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered a low town--to
a fancy-dress ball. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was to be a Highlander. There was a dress he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
could hire, which one of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) friends had had, and which fitted him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
perfectly. The Highland suit came home. Mrs. Morel received it coldly
and would not unpack it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My suit come?''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>cried William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a parcel in the front room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) rushed in and cut the string.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you fancy your son in this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, enraptured, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
the suit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I don't want to fancy you in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On the evening of the dance, when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had come home to dress, Mrs. Morel
put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) coat and bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't want to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was rather pale, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face was closed and hard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was afraid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son's going the same way as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hesitated a moment, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart stood still with anxiety. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) caught sight of the Highland
bonnet with its ribbons. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) picked it up gleefully, forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
went out.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was nineteen he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) suddenly left the Co-op. office and got a
situation in Nottingham. In his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) new place he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had thirty shillings a week
instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father
were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William. It seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped, with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) aid, to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
younger sons. Annie was now studying to be a teacher. Paul, also very
clever, was getting on well, having lessons in French and German from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) godfather, the clergyman who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel.
Arthur, a spoilt and very good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but
there was talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) trying to get a scholarship for the High School in
Nottingham.

<p/>William remained a year at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) new post in Nottingham. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was studying
hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be fretting him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Still
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went out to the dances and the river parties. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not drink. The
children were all rabid teetotallers. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came home very late at night,
and sat yet longer studying. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother implored him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to take more care,
to do one thing or another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can work in
the office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN study on top of all. You
can't; the human frame won't stand it. Do one thing or the other--amuse
yourself or learn Latin; but don't try to do both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year. This
seemed a fabulous sum. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother doubted almost whether to rejoice or
to grieve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cried, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
eyes blazing as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything go silent
inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) read the letter: <div class="bookquote">''`And will you reply by Thursday whether
you accept. Yours faithfully--' They want me, mother, at a hundred and
twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me. Didn't I tell you I could
do it! Think of me in London! And I can give you twenty pounds a year,
mater. We s'll all be rolling in money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered sadly.

<p/>It never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might be more hurt at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) going
away than glad of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) success. Indeed, as the days drew near for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
departure, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart began to close and grow dreary with despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) so much! More than that, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hoped in him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) so much. Almost she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
lived by him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked to do things for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked to put a cup for
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tea and to iron his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) collars, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was so proud. It was a joy
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to have him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) collars. There was no laundry. So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
used to rub away at them with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little convex iron, to polish them,
till they shone from the sheer pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arm. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not do
it for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Now he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was going away. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were going
as well out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not seem to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) inhabited with
himself. That was the grief and the pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took nearly all
himself away.

<p/>A few days before his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) departure--he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was just twenty--he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) burned his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen
cupboard. From some of them he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had read extracts to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother. Some
of them she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too
trivial.

<p/>Now, on the Saturday morning he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can have the
birds and flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) Saturday's work on the Friday, because he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
having a last day's holiday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was making him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a rice cake, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) loved, to take with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was scarcely conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was so
miserable.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted, and had
purple and green thistles. William sniffed the page.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice scent! Smell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Um!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, breathing in. <div class="bookquote">``What d'you call it? Smell, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother ducked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) small, fine nose down to the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to smell their rubbish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, sniffing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This girl's father,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William, ``is as rich as Croesus. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) owns
property without end. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) calls me Lafayette, because I know French.
``You will see, I've forgiven you'--I like HER forgiving me. <div class="bookquote">``I told
mother about you this morning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will have much pleasure if you
come to tea on Sunday, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will have to get father's consent also. I
sincerely hope he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will agree. I will let you know how it transpires. If,
however, you--'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Let you know how it' what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Transpires'--oh yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Transpires!'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. <div class="bookquote">``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was so
well educated!''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden, giving
Paul the corner with the thistles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued to read extracts from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) letters, some of which amused his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, some of which saddened her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
and made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anxious for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they're very wise. They know they've only got to
flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like a dog that has its
head scratched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they can't go on scratching for ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``And when
they've done, I trot away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you can't pull
off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't flatter
themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You flatter YOURSELF,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/>Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained of the
file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or forty pretty
tickets from the corners of the notepaper--swallows and forget-me-nots
and ivy sprays. And William went to London, to start a new life.



<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>THE YOUNG LIFE OF PAUL

<p/>PAUL would be built like his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother, slightly and rather small. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fair
hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) eyes were grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was a
pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with a full,
dropping underlip.

<p/>As a rule he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed old for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) years. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was so conscious of what other
people felt, particularly his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fretted he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) understood,
and could have no peace. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) soul seemed always attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) grew older he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) became stronger. William was too far removed from
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) as a companion. So the smaller boy belonged at first
almost entirely to Annie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was a tomboy and a <div class="bookquote">``flybie-skybie'' (<font color='red'><b>a tomboy flybie-skybie</b></font>)</div>, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
mother called her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was intensely fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) second brother. So
Paul was towed round at the heels of Annie, sharing her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) game. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) raced
wildly at lerky with the other young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And
always Paul flew beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), living her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) share of the game, having as
yet no part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was quiet and not noticeable. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sister
adored him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) always seemed to care for things if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had a big doll of which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was fearfully proud, though not so fond.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with an antimacassar,
to sleep. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) forgot it. Meantime Paul must practise jumping off
the sofa arm. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) jumped crash into the face of the hidden doll.
Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail, and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul
remained quite still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it was
there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for the doll
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat helpless with misery. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) grief wore itself out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) forgave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) brother--he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was so much upset. But a day or two afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was
shocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let's burn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) wanted to see what the boy
would do. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made an altar of bricks, pulled some of the shavings out of
Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into the hollow face, poured
on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing alight. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) watched with
wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off the broken forehead of
Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame. So long as the stupid big
doll burned he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rejoiced in silence. At the end be poked among the embers
with a stick, fished out the arms and legs, all blackened, and smashed
them under stones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``An' I'm glad
there's nothing left of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) could say nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had broken it.

<p/>All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly against their
father, along with their mother. Morel continued to bully and to drink.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had periods, months at a time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made the whole life of the
family a misery. Paul never forgot coming home from the Band of Hope
one Monday evening and finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eye swollen and
discoloured, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father standing on the hearthrug, feet astride, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
head down, and William, just home from work, glaring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father.
There was a silence as the young children entered, but none of the
elders looked round.

<p/>William was white to the lips, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fists were clenched. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) waited
until the children were silent, watching with children's rage and hate;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You coward, you daren't do it when I was in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Morel's blood was up. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) swung round on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son. William was bigger,
but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dossn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o' thy chelp, my
young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee. Ay, an' I sholl that,
dost see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel crouched at the knees and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fist in an ugly, almost
beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will yer?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, quiet and intense. <div class="bookquote">``It `ud be the last time,
though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fist to
strike. William put his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fists ready. A light came into his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) blue eyes,
almost like a laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father. Another word, and the men
would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would. The three children sat
pale on the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop it, both of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice. <div class="bookquote">``We've had
enough for ONE night. And YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, turning on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband,
<div class="bookquote">``look at your children!''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel glanced at the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sneered. <div class="bookquote">``Why, what
have I done to the children, I should like to know? But they're like
yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and nasty ways--you've
learned 'em in it, you `ave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) refused to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). No one spoke. After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
boots under the table and went to bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you let me have a go at him (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William, when his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father
was upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``I could easily have beaten him (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice thing--your own father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`FATHER!'''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>repeated William. <div class="bookquote">``Call HIM MY father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is--and so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why don't you let me settle him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? I could do, easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It hasn't come to THAT yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's come to worse. Look at yourself. WHY didn't you let
me give it him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried quickly.

<p/>And the children went to bed, miserably.

<p/>When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms to a
house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley, which
spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it. In
front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind, sweeping from
Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force, and the tree shrieked
again. Morel liked it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's music,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It sends me to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became almost a
demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year in the new house their
father was very bad. The children played in the street, on the brim of
the wide, dark valley, until eight o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their
mother sat sewing below. Having such a great space in front of the house
gave the children a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This
terror came in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the
home discord. Often Paul would wake up, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been asleep a long
time, aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was wide awake. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
heard the booming shouts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father, come home nearly drunk, then the
sharp replies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, then the bang, bang of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father's fist on
the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks and
cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children lay silent in
suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear what their father was
doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might hit their mother again. There was a feeling of horror,
a kind of bristling in the darkness, and a sense of blood. They lay with
their hearts in the grip of an intense anguish. The wind came through
the tree fiercer and fiercer. All the chords of the great harp hummed,
whistled, and shrieked. And then came the horror of the sudden silence,
silence everywhere, outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a
silence of blood? What had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) done?

<p/>The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last, they
heard their father throw down his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) boots and tramp upstairs in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last, if the wind allowed,
they heard the water of the tap drumming into the kettle, which their
mother was filling for morning, and they could go to sleep in peace.

<p/>So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing, dancing at
night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of the darkness. But they
had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts, one darkness in their
eyes, which showed all their lives.

<p/>Paul hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father. As a boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a fervent private religion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stop drinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) prayed every night. <div class="bookquote">``Lord, let my father
die,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) prayed very often. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not be killed at pit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) prayed
when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.

<p/>That was another time when the family suffered intensely. The children
came from school and had their teas. On the hob the big black saucepan
was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven, ready for Morel's dinner.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was expected at five o'clock. But for months he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would stop and drink
every night on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way from work.

<p/>In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early, Mrs. Morel
would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a tallow candle to
save the gas. The children finished their bread-and-butter, or dripping,
and were ready to go out to play. But if Morel had not come they
faltered. The sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sitting in all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pit-dirt, drinking, after
a long day's work, not coming home and eating and washing, but sitting,
getting drunk, on an empty stomach, made Mrs. Morel unable to bear
herself. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) the feeling was transmitted to the other children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
never suffered alone any more: the children suffered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough of
twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were. A few last
colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter came along. No
more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley; work was done.
It was night.

<p/>Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still burned on
the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone. On the hob
the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting on the table. All
the room was full of the sense of waiting, waiting for the man who was
sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pit-dirt, dinnerless, some mile away from home, across
the darkness, drinking himself drunk. Paul stood in the doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has my dad come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can see he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) hasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, cross with the futility of the
question.

<p/>Then the boy dawdled about near his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother. They shared the same
anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained the potatoes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're ruined and black,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but what do I care?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother for suffering
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father did not come home from work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you bother yourself for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) wants to stop and get
drunk, why don't you let him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>flashed Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``You may well say `let him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a quick
way to ruining himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home. The children were yet young, and
depended on the breadwinner. William gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) the sense of relief,
providing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But the
tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.

<p/>The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay on the
table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense of anxiety
and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it any longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
could not go out and play. So he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran in to Mrs. Inger, next door but
one, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Inger</b></font>) to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Inger</b></font>) had no children. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Inger</b></font>) husband was good
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inger</b></font>) but was in a shop, and came home late. So, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Inger</b></font>) saw the lad
at the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inger</b></font>) called:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly the boy rose, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friend what
ailed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran indoors.

<p/>Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a nice time to come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shouted.

<p/>And everybody in the house was still, because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was dangerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ate
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had done,
pushed all the pots in a heap away from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms on the
table. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went to sleep.

<p/>Paul hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father so. The collier's small, mean head, with its black
hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms, and the face,
dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin, paltry brows, was
turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness and nasty temper. If
anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made, the man looked up and
shouted:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha doesna stop
that clatter! Dost hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion, usually at Annie,
made the family writhe with hate of the man.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anything.
The children, alone with their mother, told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all about the day's
happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in them until it
was told to their mother. But as soon as the father came in, everything
stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was like the scotch in the smooth, happy machinery of the
home. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always aware of this fall of silence on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entry,
the shutting off of life, the unwelcome. But now it was gone too far to
alter.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would dearly have liked the children to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but they could
not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to tell your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper. Everybody was
highly jubilant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you'd better tell your father when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.
<div class="bookquote">``You know how be carries on and says he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s never told anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would almost rather have forfeited the
prize than have to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've won a prize in a competition, dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. Morel turned round to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing--about famous women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hm--hm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the father and any
other member of the family. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was an outsider. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had denied the God in
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>The only times when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered again into the life of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own people
was when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pit-bottle. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always
wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it. They united with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the work, in the actual doing of something, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) real
self again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in a good
humour, always sang. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had whole periods, months, almost years, of
friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was jolly again. It was
nice to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) run with a piece of red-hot iron into the scullery,
crying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of my road--out of my road!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) iron goose, and made
the shape he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wanted. Or he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat absorbed for a moment, soldering. Then
the children watched with joy as the metal sank suddenly molten, and was
shoved about against the nose of the soldering-iron, while the room was
full of a scent of burnt resin and hot tin, and Morel was silent and
intent for a minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always sang when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mended boots because of the
jolly sound of hammering. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was rather happy when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat putting
great patches on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) moleskin pit trousers, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would often do,
considering them too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife to
mend.

<p/>But the best time for the young children was when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made fuses. Morel
fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic. These he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
cleaned with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand, till each one gleamed like a stalk of gold, after
which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cut the straws into lengths of about six inches, leaving, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
could, a notch at the bottom of each piece. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always had a beautifully
sharp knife that could cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) set
in the middle of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black
grains upon the white-scrubbed board. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made and trimmed the straws
while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see the
black grains trickle down a crack in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) palm into the mouth of the
straw, peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
bunged up the mouth with a bit of soap--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thumb-nail
from a pat in a saucer--and the straw was finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, dad!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right, my beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Morel, who was peculiarly lavish of
endearments to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) second son. Paul popped the fuse into the powder-tin,
ready for the morning, when Morel would take it to the pit, and use it
to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.

<p/>Meantime Arthur, still fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father, would lean on the arm of
Morel's chair and say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell us about down pit, daddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>This Morel loved to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's one little `oss--we call `im Taffy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would begin. <div class="bookquote">``An'
he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)'s a fawce `un!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made one feel Taffy's
cunning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)'s a brown `un,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would answer, ``an' not very high. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) comes
i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' `ear `im sneeze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ello, Taff,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>you say, `what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein' some snuff?''

<p/>``An' 'e sneezes again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) slives up an' shoves `is `ead on yer,
that cadin'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`What's want, Taff?''  (<font color='red'><b>yo</b></font>)</div>yo' say.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/ARTHUR</b></font>)</div>Arthur always asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody loved it.

<p/>Or sometimes it was a new tale.

<p/>``An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat on at
snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Hey up, theer!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shouts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' I wor just in time ter get `im by th' tail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you kill it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' what do they live on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The corn as the `osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket an' eat
your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your coat--the
slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel had some job
to do. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) always went to bed very early, often before the
children. There was nothing remaining for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to stay up for, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
had finished tinkering, and had skimmed the headlines of the newspaper.

<p/>And the children felt secure when their father was in bed. They lay and
talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights went suddenly
sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung in the hands of the
colliers tramping by outside, going to take the nine o'clock shift. They
listened to the voices of the men, imagined them dipping down into the
dark valley. Sometimes they went to the window and watched the three
or four lamps growing tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the
darkness. Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in
the warmth.

<p/>Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis. The others were
all quite strong; so this was another reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's difference
in feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came home at dinner-time feeling ill. But
it was not a family to make any fuss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with YOU?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother asked sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ate no dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So after dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz cushions the
children loved. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fell into a kind of doze. That afternoon Mrs.
Morel was ironing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) listened to the small, restless noise the boy
made in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) throat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) worked. Again rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart the old,
almost weary feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had never expected him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to live.
And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a great vitality in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) young body. Perhaps it would have
been a little relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) always felt a mixture of
anguish in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of the clatter of the
iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud, thud on the ironing-board.
Once roused, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes to see his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother standing on the
hearthrug with the hot iron near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cheek, listening, as it were, to
the heat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still face, with the mouth closed tight from suffering and
disillusion and self-denial, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nose the smallest bit on one side,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blue eyes so young, quick, and warm, made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart contract
with love. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was quiet, so, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked brave and rich with life,
but as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been done out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rights. It hurt the boy keenly,
this feeling about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life's fulfilment:
and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own incapability to make up to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with a sense of
impotence, yet made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) patiently dogged inside. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) childish
aim.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded, raced off the
dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rubbed the iron on the sack
lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was warm in the ruddy firelight.
Paul loved the way she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) crouched and put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head on one side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
movements were light and quick. It was always a pleasure to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
Nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ever did, no movement she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ever made, could have been found
fault with by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children. The room was warm and full of the scent of
hot linen. Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not mind much.
What happened happened, and it was no good kicking against the pricks.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved the evenings, after eight o'clock, when the light was put out,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could watch the fire-flames spring over the darkness of the walls
and ceiling; could watch huge shadows waving and tossing, till the room
seemed full of men who battled silently.

<p/>On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disturbed the atmosphere
for the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ter asleep, my darlin'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Morel asked softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; is my mother comin'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Morel
rarely <div class="bookquote">``thee'd''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want nothing. But how long will she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not long, my duckie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/>The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment or two. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
felt his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went to the top of the stairs and
said to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) to go to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says you're to go to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>the father repeated gently to Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I want HER to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>insisted the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) can't go off till you come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Morel called downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs. There's
the other children--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved a
fire dearly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) won't be long,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish with
irritation. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's presence seemed to aggravate all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sick
impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) son awhile,
said softly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, my darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.

<p/>Paul loved to sleep with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. Sleep is still most perfect, in
spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved. The warmth, the
security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from the touch of the
other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body and soul completely in
its healing. Paul lay against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and slept, and got better; whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
always a bad sleeper, fell later on into a profound sleep that seemed to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faith.

<p/>In convalescence he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would sit up in bed, see the fluffy horses feeding
at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay on the trodden yellow
snow; watch the miners troop home--small, black figures trailing slowly
in gangs across the white field. Then the night came up in dark blue
vapour from the snow.

<p/>In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes, suddenly
arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,
then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass. The
snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house, like pigeons dashing
by. Away across the valley the little black train crawled doubtfully
over the great whiteness.

<p/>While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they could do
anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur went out early
in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms, hunting through the
wet grass, from which the larks were rising, for the white-skinned,
wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in the green. And if they got
half a pound they felt exceedingly happy: there was the joy of finding
something, the joy of accepting something straight from the hand of
Nature, and the joy of contributing to the family exchequer.

<p/>But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty, was the
blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on the Saturdays;
also she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured the coppices and
woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry was to be found, every
week-end going on their search. In that region of mining villages
blackberries became a comparative rarity. But Paul hunted far and wide.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved being out in the country, among the bushes. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) also could
not bear to go home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother empty. That, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt, would disappoint
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have died rather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would exclaim as the lads came in, late, and tired
to death, and hungry, <div class="bookquote">``wherever have you been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lads</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul, <div class="bookquote">``there wasn't any, so we went over Misk Hills. And
look here, our mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) peeped into the basket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, those are fine ones!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there's over two pounds--isn't there over two pounds'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tried the basket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered doubtfully.

<p/>Then Paul fished out a little spray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) always brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) one spray,
the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could find.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting a
love-token.

<p/>The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than own himself
beaten and come home to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) empty-handed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never realised this,
whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was young. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a woman who waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children to grow
up. And William occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chiefly.

<p/>But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at home, the
mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was unconsciously jealous of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brother, and William was jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). At the same time, they were
good friends.

<p/>Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) second son was more subtle and fine,
perhaps not so passionate as with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eldest. It was the rule that Paul
should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers of the five
pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually. All the earnings of
each stall were put down to the chief butty, as contractor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>)
divided the wages again, either in the public-house or in his (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) own home.
So that the children could fetch the money, school closed early on
Friday afternoons. Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie,
then Paul--had fetched the money on Friday afternoons, until they went
themselves to work. Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a
little calico bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls,
children, and men were seen trooping to the offices.

<p/>These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building, almost
like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of Greenhill
Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room paved with blue
brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall. Here sat the
colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early. The women and
children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths. Paul always
examined the grass border, and the big grass bank, because in it grew
tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. There was a sound of many voices.
The women had on their Sunday hats. The girls chattered loudly. Little
dogs ran here and there. The green shrubs were silent all around.

<p/>Then from inside came the cry <div class="bookquote">``Spinney Park--Spinney Park.''  (<font color='red'><b>the folk</b></font>)</div>All the folk
for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time for Bretty to be paid,
Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room was quite small. A counter
went across, dividing it into half. Behind the counter stood two
men--Mr. Braithwaite and his (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>) clerk, Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite
was large, somewhat of the stern patriarch in appearance, having a
rather thin white beard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>) was usually muffled in an enormous silk
neckerchief, and right up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the
open grate. No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the
throats of the people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom
was rather small and fat, and very bald. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) made remarks that were not
witty, whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions against
the colliers.

<p/>The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had been
home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually a dog.
Paul was quite small, so it was often his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fate to be jammed behind the
legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew the order of
the names--they went according to stall number.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Holliday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Braithwaite</b></font>)</div>came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite. Then Mrs.
Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bower--John Bower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A boy</b></font>)</div><p/>A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
glowered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>) spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John Bower!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you used to `ave a different nose than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Winterbottom</b></font>)</div>said glossy Mr.
Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered, thinking of
John Bower senior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it your father's not come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Braithwaite</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Braithwaite, in a large and
magisterial voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s badly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>piped the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to keep off the drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cashier</b></font>)</div>pronounced the great
cashier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' niver mind if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) foot through yer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a mocking voice
from behind.

<p/>All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>)
next sheet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred Pilkington!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>) called, quite indifferent.

<p/>Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

<p/>Paul knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turn was next but one, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart began to beat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
pushed against the chimney-piece. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) calves were burning. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did
not hope to get through the wall of men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter Morel!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the ringing voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>piped Paul, small and inadequate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Morel--Walter Morel!''  (<font color='red'><b>the cashier finger thumb</b></font>)</div>the cashier repeated, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) finger and thumb on the
invoice, ready to pass on.

<p/>Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could not
or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Then Mr.
Winterbottom came to the rescue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s here. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)? Morel's lad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man round</b></font>)</div><p/>The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) pointed at
the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside, and disclosed the
boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Winterbottom</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Winterbottom.

<p/>Paul went to the counter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you shout up when
you're called?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Braithwaite</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Braithwaite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>) banged on to the invoice a
five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate and pretty movement, picked
up a little ten-pound column of gold, and plumped it beside the silver.
The gold slid in a bright stream over the paper. The cashier finished
counting off the money; the boy dragged the whole down the counter to
Mr. Winterbottom, to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid.
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) suffered again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sixteen an' six,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Winterbottom</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Winterbottom.

<p/>The lad was too much upset to count. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) pushed forward some loose silver
and half a sovereign.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much do you think you've given me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Winterbottom</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Winterbottom.

<p/>The boy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not the faintest notion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you got a tongue in your head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lip, and pushed forward some more silver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nowt but algibbra an' French,''  (<font color='red'><b>a collier</b></font>)</div>said a collier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' cheek an' impidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/>Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
money into the bag and slid out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) suffered the tortures of the damned
on these occasions.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) relief, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got outside, and was walking along the Mansfield
Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green. There were
some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple trees of an
orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream. The boy went near
the wall, self-consciously. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew many of the men, but could not
recognise them in their dirt. And this was a new torture to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father was not yet come.
Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandmother, Morel's mother,
had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father's not come yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady, in the peculiar
half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly to
grown men. <div class="bookquote">``Sit you down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar. Some colliers were
<div class="bookquote">``reckoning'' (<font color='red'><b>Some colliers</b></font>)</div>--sharing out their money--in a corner; others came in. They
all glanced at the boy without speaking. At last Morel came; brisk, and
with something of an air, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blackness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said rather tenderly to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``Have you bested me? Shall
you have a drink of something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all the men than
in having a tooth drawn.

<p/>The landlady looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) _de haut en bas_, rather pitying, and at
the same time, resenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) clear, fierce morality. Paul went home,
glowering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) entered the house silently. Friday was baking day, and
there was usually a hot bun. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother put it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in a fury, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes flashing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm NOT going to the office any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother asked in surprise. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sudden rages
rather amused her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm NOT going any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well, tell your father so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bun as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough of the
sixpence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying birthday
presents; but it WAS an income, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) treasured it. But--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They can have it, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``But you needn't bully ME about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are, and I'm not going
any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his (<font color='blue'><b>Braithwaite</b></font>) `h's', an' Mr. Winterbottom says
<div class="bookquote">``You was'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that why you won't go any more?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>smiled Mrs. Morel.

<p/>The boy was silent for some time. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face was pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes dark and
furious. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother moved about at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) work, taking no notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied.

<p/>``An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, <div class="bookquote">``What do they teach you at the
Board-school?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They never taught HIM much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``that is a fact--neither
manners nor wit--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) cunning he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was born with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>So, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ridiculous hypersensitiveness
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was the cheque?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen and six stoppages,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>replied the boy. <div class="bookquote">``It's a good week; and only five shillings stoppages
for my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was able to calculate how much her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband had earned, and could
call him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to account if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) short money. Morel always kept to
himself the secret of the week's amount.

<p/>Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the rule that Paul
should stay at home and bake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved to stop in and draw or read; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was very fond of drawing. Annie always <div class="bookquote">``gallivanted''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>on Friday nights;
Arthur was enjoying himself as usual. So the boy remained alone.

<p/>Mrs. Morel loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) marketing. In the tiny market-place on the top
of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby, Ilkeston
and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran in from
surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women, the streets
packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men everywhere in the
streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lace woman, sympathised
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) fruit man--who was a gabey, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife was a bad `un--laughed
with the fish man--who was a scamp but so droll--put the linoleum man
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place, was cold with the odd-wares man, and only went to the
crockery man when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a
little dish; then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was coldly polite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wondered how much that little dish was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sevenpence to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put the dish down and walked away; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not leave the
market-place without it. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went by where the pots lay coldly on
the floor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) glanced at the dish furtively, pretending not to.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bonnet was
in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl implored, <div class="bookquote">``don't wear that nubbly little bonnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what else shall I wear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>replied the mother tartly. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm sure
it's right enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was reduced to
black lace and a bit of jet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks rather come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you give it a
pick-me-up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll jowl your head for impudence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tied the
strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) chin.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) glanced at the dish again. Both she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) enemy, the pot man,
had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something between them.
Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want it for fivepence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) started. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart hardened; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stooped and took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
dish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer'll do me the favour, like?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Yer'd better spit in it, like
yer do when y'ave something give yer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel paid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the fivepence in a cold manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see you give it me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't let me have it for
fivepence if you didn't want to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky if you
can give your things away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) growled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; there are bad times, and good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had forgiven the pot man. They were friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dare now finger
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pots. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was happy.

<p/>Paul was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) home-coming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was always her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels, feeling rich in spirit.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) quick, light step in the entry and looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
drawing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sighed, smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) from the doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word, you ARE loaded!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``That brazen Annie said she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'d meet me. SUCH a
weight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) string bag and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) packages on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the bread done?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked, going to the oven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The last one is soaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't look, I've not
forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that pot man!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, closing the oven door. <div class="bookquote">``You know what a
wretch I've said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was? Well, I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s quite so bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy was attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) little black bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't make any money--well, it's everybody's cry alike
nowadays--and it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would ME,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, one can't wonder at it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let me have--how much do you think
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let me have THIS for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood looking on it
with joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>The two stood together gloating over the dish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I LOVE cornflowers on things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One and three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fivepence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not enough, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd been
extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needn't have let me have
it if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't wanted to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needn't, need he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, and the two comforted each other
from the fear of having robbed the pot man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We c'n have stewed fruit in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or custard, or a jelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or radishes and lettuce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't forget that bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice bright with glee.

<p/>Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, giving it to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tapped it also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied, going to unpack her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bag. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, and I'm a wicked,
extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hopped to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) side eagerly, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) latest extravagance. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of pansies
and of crimson daisies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four penn`orth!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How CHEAP!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't they!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed, giving way to pure joy. <div class="bookquote">``Paul, look at
this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like an old man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>cried Paul, stooping to sniff. <div class="bookquote">``And smells that nice! But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a
bit splashed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully washed
the pansy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``NOW look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s wet!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>pansy</b></font>) exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.

<p/>The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the end where
the Morels lived there were not many young things. So the few were more
united. Boys and girls played together, the girls joining in the fights
and the rough games, the boys taking part in the dancing games and rings
and make-belief of the girls.

<p/>Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings, when it was not
wet. They stayed indoors till the colliers were all gone home, till it
was thick dark, and the street would be deserted. Then they tied their
scarves round their necks, for they scorned overcoats, as all the
colliers' children did, and went out. The entry was very dark, and at
the end the whole great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little
tangle of lights below where Minton pit lay, and another far away
opposite for Selby. The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the
darkness for ever. The children looked anxiously down the road at the
one lamp-post, which stood at the end of the field path. If the little,
luminous space were deserted, the two boys felt genuine desolation. They
stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp, turning their
backs on the night, quite miserable, watching the dark houses. Suddenly
a pinafore under a short coat was seen, and a long-legged girl came
flying up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They set up a game
round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling. Then the play
went fast and furious.

<p/>There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop of
darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide, dark
way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came out of this
way and went into the field down the path. In a dozen yards the night
had swallowed them. The children played on.

<p/>They were brought exceedingly close together owing to their isolation.
If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt. Arthur was very
touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse. Then Paul had to
side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice, while Billy Pillins
always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back him (<font color='blue'><b>Pillins</b></font>) up. Then the six would
fight, hate with a fury of hatred, and flee home in terror. Paul never
forgot, after one of these fierce internecine fights, seeing a big red
moon lift itself up, slowly, between the waste road over the hilltop,
steadily, like a great bird. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought of the Bible, that the moon
should be turned to blood. And the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made haste to be friends
with Billy Pillins. And then the wild, intense games went on again under
the lamp-post, surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) parlour, would hear the children singing away:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
My socks are made of silk;
I wear a ring on every finger,
I wash myself in milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came
out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing.
It stirred the mother; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) understood when they came in at eight
o'clock, ruddy, with brilliant eyes, and quick, passionate speech.

<p/>They all loved the Scargill Street house for its openness, for the great
scallop of the world it had in view. On summer evenings the women would
stand against the field fence, gossiping, facing the west, watching the
sunsets flare quickly out, till the Derbyshire hills ridged across the
crimson far away, like the black crest of a newt.

<p/>In this summer season the pits never turned full time, particularly the
soft coal. Mrs. Dakin, who lived next door to Mrs. Morel, going to the
field fence to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hearthrug, would spy men coming slowly up the
hill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw at once they were colliers. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) waited, a tall, thin,
shrew-faced woman, standing on the hill brow, almost like a menace to
the poor colliers who were toiling up. It was only eleven o'clock. From
the far-off wooded hills the haze that hangs like fine black crape at
the back of a summer morning had not yet dissipated. The first man came
to the stile. <div class="bookquote">``Chock-chock!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went the gate under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, han' yer knocked off?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dakin</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Dakin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We han, missis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity as they letn yer goo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dakin</b></font>) said sarcastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you know you're flig to come up again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dakin</b></font>) said.

<p/>And the man went on. Mrs. Dakin, going up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dakin</b></font>) yard, spied Mrs. Morel
taking the ashes to the ash-pit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I reckon Minton's knocked off, missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it sickenin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Morel in wrath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! But I'n just seed Jont Hutchby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They might as well have saved their shoe-leather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. And
both women went indoors disgusted.

<p/>The colliers, their faces scarcely blackened, were trooping home again.
Morel hated to go back. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved the sunny morning. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone to
pit to work, and to be sent home again spoilt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious, at this time!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I help it, woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I've not done half enough dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll eat my bit o' snap as I took with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bawled
pathetically. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt ignominious and sore.

<p/>And the children, coming home from school, would wonder to see their
father eating with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dinner the two thick slices of rather dry and
dirty bread-and-butter that had been to pit and back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's my dad eating his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) snap for now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/ARTHUR</b></font>)</div>asked Arthur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should ha'e it holled at me if I didna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>snorted Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a story!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' is it goin' to be wasted?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not such a extravagant
mortal as you lot, with your waste. If I drop a bit of bread at pit, in
all the dust an' dirt, I pick it up an' eat it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The mice would eat it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't be wasted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good bread-an'-butter's not for mice, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Dirty or
not dirty, I'd eat it rather than it should be wasted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might leave it for the mice and pay for it out of your next pint,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, might I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>They were very poor that autumn. William had just gone away to London,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother missed his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) money. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sent ten shillings once or twice,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had many things to pay for at first. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) letters came regularly
once a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wrote a good deal to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
life, how he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) made friends, and was exchanging lessons with a Frenchman,
how he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) enjoyed London. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother felt again he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was remaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
just as when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) every week her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) direct,
rather witty letters. All day long, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cleaned the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in London: he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would do well. Almost, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was like
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knight who wore HER favour in the battle.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was coming at Christmas for five days. There had never been such
preparations. Paul and Arthur scoured the land for holly and evergreens.
Annie made the pretty paper hoops in the old-fashioned way. And there
was unheard-of extravagance in the larder. Mrs. Morel made a big and
magnificent cake. Then, feeling queenly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) showed Paul how to blanch
almonds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) skinned the long nuts reverently, counting them all, to see
not one was lost. It was said that eggs whisked better in a cold place.
So the boy stood in the scullery, where the temperature was nearly at
freezing-point, and whisked and whisked, and flew in excitement to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
mother as the white of egg grew stiffer and more snowy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just look, mother! Isn't it lovely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) balanced a bit on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nose, then blew it in the air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't waste it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/>Everybody was mad with excitement. William was coming on Christmas Eve.
Mrs. Morel surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pantry. There was a big plum cake, and a rice
cake, jam tarts, lemon tarts, and mince-pies--two enormous dishes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was finishing cooking--Spanish tarts and cheese-cakes. Everywhere was
decorated. The kissing bunch of berried holly hung with bright and
glittering things, spun slowly over Mrs. Morel's head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) trimmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
little tarts in the kitchen. A great fire roared. There was a scent of
cooked pastry. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was due at seven o'clock, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would be late. The
three children had gone to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was alone. But at a quarter to
seven Morel came in again. Neither wife nor husband spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
armchair, quite awkward with excitement, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) quietly went on with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) baking. Only by the careful way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did things could it be
told how much moved she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was. The clock ticked on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time dost say he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Morel asked for the fifth time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The train gets in at half-past six,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied emphatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'ll be here at ten past seven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, bless you, it'll be hours late on the Midland,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said
indifferently. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hoped, by expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) late, to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) early.
Morel went down the entry to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness, man!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You're like an ill-sitting hen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadna you better be gettin' him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) summat t' eat ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>asked the father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's plenty of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not so much as I can see on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered, turning crossly in
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) began to clear her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) table. The kettle was singing. They
waited and waited.

<p/>Meantime the three children were on the platform at Sethley Bridge,
on the Midland main line, two miles from home. They waited one hour.
A train came--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not there. Down the line the red and green lights
shone. It was very dark and very cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if the London train's come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul to Annie, when they saw
a man in a tip cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie. <div class="bookquote">``You be quiet--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might send us off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>But Paul was dying for the man to know they were expecting someone by
the London train: it sounded so grand. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was much too much scared
of broaching any man, let alone one in a peaked cap, to dare to ask. The
three children could scarcely go into the waiting-room for fear of being
sent away, and for fear something should happen whilst they were off the
platform. Still they waited in the dark and cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an hour an' a half late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/ARTHUR</b></font>)</div>said Arthur pathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie, <div class="bookquote">``it's Christmas Eve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>They all grew silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wasn't coming. They looked down the darkness
of the railway. There was London! It seemed the utter-most of distance.
They thought anything might happen if one came from London. They were
all too troubled to talk. Cold, and unhappy, and silent, they huddled
together on the platform.

<p/>At last, after more than two hours, they saw the lights of an engine
peering round, away down the darkness. A porter ran out. The children
drew back with beating hearts. A great train, bound for Manchester, drew
up. Two doors opened, and from one of them, William. They flew to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) handed parcels to them cheerily, and immediately began to explain
that this great train had stopped for HIS (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sake at such a small station
as Sethley Bridge: it was not booked to stop.

<p/>Meanwhile the parents were getting anxious. The table was set, the chop
was cooked, everything was ready. Mrs. Morel put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) black apron.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) best dress. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat, pretending to read. The
minutes were a torture to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``It's an hour an' a ha'ef.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And those children waiting!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' train canna ha' come in yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you, on Christmas Eve they're HOURS wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both a bit cross with each other, so gnawed with anxiety. The
ash tree moaned outside in a cold, raw wind. And all that space of night
from London home! Mrs. Morel suffered. The slight click of the works
inside the clock irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). It was getting so late; it was getting
unbearable.

<p/>At last there was a sound of voices, and a footstep in the entry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha's here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Morel, jumping up.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood back. The mother ran a few steps towards the door and
waited. There was a rush and a patter of feet, the door burst open.
William was there. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) Gladstone bag and took his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother in
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mater!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried.

<p/>And for two seconds, no longer, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
withdrew and said, trying to be quite normal:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how late you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't I!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cried, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Well, dad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men shook hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel's eyes were wet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We thought tha'd niver be commin',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'd come!''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>exclaimed William.

<p/>Then the son turned round to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you look well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said proudly, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I should think so--coming home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was a fine fellow, big, straight, and fearless-looking. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) looked
round at the evergreens and the kissing bunch, and the little tarts that
lay in their tins on the hearth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By jove! mother, it's not different!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, as if in relief.

<p/>Everybody was still for a second. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) suddenly sprang forward,
picked a tart from the hearth, and pushed it whole into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, did iver you see such a parish oven!''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>the father exclaimed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had brought them endless presents. Every penny he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had spent
on them. There was a sense of luxury overflowing in the house. For his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
mother there was an umbrella with gold on the pale handle. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kept
it to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dying day, and would have lost anything rather than that.
Everybody had something gorgeous, and besides, there were pounds of
unknown sweets: Turkish delight, crystallised pineapple, and such-like
things which, the children thought, only the splendour of London could
provide. And Paul boasted of these sweets among his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Real pineapple, cut off in slices, and then turned into crystal--fair
grand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody was mad with happiness in the family. Home was home, and they
loved it with a passion of love, whatever the suffering had been. There
were parties, there were rejoicings. People came in to see William, to
see what difference London had made to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). And they all found him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``such
a gentleman, and SUCH a fine fellow, my word'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>!

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went away again the children retired to various places to weep
alone. Morel went to bed in misery, and Mrs. Morel felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were
numbed by some drug, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) feelings were paralysed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
passionately.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in the office of a lawyer connected with a large shipping firm,
and at the midsummer his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) chief offered him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a trip in the Mediterranean
on one of the boats, for quite a small cost. Mrs. Morel wrote: <div class="bookquote">``Go, go,
my boy. You may never have a chance again, and I should love to think of
you cruising there in the Mediterranean almost better than to have you
at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>But William came home for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fortnight's holiday. Not even
the Mediterranean, which pulled at all his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) young man's desire to travel,
and at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) poor man's wonder at the glamorous south, could take him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) away
when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might come home. That compensated his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother for much.



<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>PAUL LAUNCHES INTO LIFE

<p/>MOREL was rather a heedless man, careless of danger. So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had endless
accidents. Now, when Mrs. Morel heard the rattle of an empty coal-cart
cease at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) entry-end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) ran into the parlour to look, expecting
almost to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband seated in the waggon, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face grey under his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
dirt, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) body limp and sick with some hurt or other. If it were he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
would run out to help.

<p/>About a year after William went to London, and just after Paul had left
school, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got work, Mrs. Morel was upstairs and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son was
painting in the kitchen--he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was very clever with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brush--when there
came a knock at the door. Crossly he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brush to go. At the
same moment his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother opened a window upstairs and looked down.

<p/>A pit-lad in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dirt stood on the threshold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this Walter Morel's?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had guessed already.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mester's got hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``It's a wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hadn't, lad. And
what's he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) done this time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know for sure, but it's `is leg somewhere. They ta'ein' `im ter
th' `ospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Eh, dear, what a one he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) is! There's
not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is! His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thumb's
nearly better, and now--Did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I seed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring `im up in a tub, an'
'e wor in a dead faint. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shouted like anythink when Doctor Fraser
examined him (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) i' th' lamp cabin--an' cossed an' swore, an' said as 'e wor
goin' to be ta'en whoam--'e worn't goin' ter th' `ospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy faltered to an end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother. Thank
you, my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick--sick and surfeited, I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) painting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to the hospital,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
went on. <div class="bookquote">``But what a CARELESS creature he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is! OTHER men don't have all
these accidents. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) WOULD want to put all the burden on me. Eh,
dear, just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last. Put those things away,
there's no time to be painting now. What time is there a train? I know I
s'll have to go trailing to Keston. I s'll have to leave that bedroom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can finish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>``You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back, I should think. Oh,
my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll make! And those granite
setts at Tinder Hill--he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) might well call them kidney pebbles--they'll
jolt him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) almost to bits. I wonder why they can't mend them, the state
they're in, an' all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think
they'd have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must trail
them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a crying shame!
Oh, and the fuss he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll make! I know he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will! I wonder who's with him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'ll wish himself anywhere rather.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'ll look after him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), I know. Now there's no telling how long he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'ll
be stuck in that hospital--and WON<div class="bookquote">``T he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) hate it! But if it's only his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
leg it's not so bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>All the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bodice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
crouched at the boiler while the water ran slowly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lading-can.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed,
wriggling the handle impatiently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had very handsome, strong arms,
rather surprising on a smallish woman.

<p/>Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't a train till four-twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You've time enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I haven't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, blinking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) over the towel as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate. Should I come
with you to Keston?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have I to take
him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)? Eh, dear! His (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) clean shirt--and it's a blessing it IS clean. But it
had better be aired. And stockings--he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) won't want them--and a towel, I
suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A comb, a knife and fork and spoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father had been in
the hospital before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness knows what sort of state his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) feet were in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs.
Morel, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) combed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) long brown hair, that was fine as silk, and
was touched now with grey. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'s very particular to wash himself to the
waist, but below he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) thinks doesn't matter. But there, I suppose they see
plenty like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul had laid the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother one or two pieces of very
thin bread and butter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cup of tea in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't be bothered!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) insisted.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat down and sipped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tea, and ate a little, in silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was thinking.

<p/>In a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gone, to walk the two and a half miles to
Keston Station. All the things she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bulging
string bag. Paul watched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) go up the road between the hedges--a
little, quick-stepping figure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart ached for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), tripping so quickly
in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anxiety, felt at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's heart waiting on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
felt him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bearing what part of the burden he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could, even supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
And when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was at the hospital, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``It WILL upset that lad
when I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) how bad it is. I'd better be careful.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
trudging home again, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was coming to share her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) burden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) entered the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's bad enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sighed and sat down, undoing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bonnet-strings. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son watched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
face as it was lifted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) small, work-hardened hands fingering at
the bow under her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``it's not really dangerous, but the nurse says
it's a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
leg--here--and it's a compound fracture. There are pieces of bone
sticking through--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh--how horrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continued, ``of course he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s going to die--it wouldn't
be him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) didn't. ``I'm done for, my lass!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, looking at me.
``Don't be so silly,'' I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). ``You're not going to die of a broken
leg, however badly it's smashed.'' ``I s'll niver come out of `ere but in
a wooden box,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) groaned. ``Well,<div class="bookquote">'' I said, `if you want them to carry
you into the garden in a wooden box, when you're better, I've no doubt
they will.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If we think it's good for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Sister</b></font>)</div>said the Sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)'s an
awfully nice Sister, but rather strict.''

<p/>Mrs. Morel took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bonnet. The children waited in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) IS bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) will be. It's a great
shock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s lost a lot of blood; and, of course, it IS a very
dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend so easily. And
then there's the fever and the mortification--if it took bad ways he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d
quickly be gone. But there, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s a clean-blooded man, with wonderful
healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD take bad ways. Of
course there's a wound--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children realised
that it was very bad for their father, and the house was silent,
anxious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) always gets better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul after a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/>Everybody moved about in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) really looked nearly done for,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But the Sister says
that is the pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>Annie took away her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother's coat and bonnet.

<p/>``And he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) looked at me when I came away! I said: ``I s'll have to go now,
Walter, because of the train--and the children.<div class="bookquote">'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at me. It
seems hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brush again and went on painting. Arthur went outside
for some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) little
rocking-chair that her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) husband had made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) when the first baby was
coming, remained motionless, brooding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was grieved, and bitterly
sorry for the man who was hurt so much. But still, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) heart of
hearts, where the love should have burned, there was a blank. Now, when
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) woman's pity was roused to its full extent, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would have
slaved herself to death to nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and to save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would
have taken the pain herself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) could, somewhere far away inside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) felt indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffering. It hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
most of all, this failure to love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), even when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) strong
emotions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) brooded a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``when I'd got halfway to Keston, I found
I'd come out in my working boots--and LOOK at them.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They were an old
pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at the toes. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know
what to do with myself, for shame,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) added.

<p/>In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel talked
again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son, who was helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) housework.

<p/>``I found Barker at the hospital. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) did look bad, poor little fellow!
``Well,<div class="bookquote">'' I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), `what sort of a journey did you have with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dunna ax me, missis!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>)'d be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it WOR bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>), Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
said. <div class="bookquote">``At ivry jolt I thought my `eart would ha' flown clean out o' my
mouth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a
fortune would I go through wi' it again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can quite understand it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a nasty job, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, `an' one as'll be a long
while afore it's right again.'' ``I'm afraid it will,<div class="bookquote">'' I said. I like Mr.
Barker--I DO like him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>). There's something so manly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) task silently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel continued, ``for a man like your father,
the hospital IS hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) CAN<div class="bookquote">``T understand rules and regulations. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
won't let anybody else touch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), not if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can help it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smashed
the muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thigh, and it had to be dressed four times a day,
WOULD he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let anybody but me or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother do it? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't. So, of
course, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll suffer in there with the nurses. And I didn't like leaving
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I'm sure, when I kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an' came away, it seemed a shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son, almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were thinking aloud to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) took it in as best he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could, by sharing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) trouble to lighten
it. And in the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shared almost everything with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) without
knowing.

<p/>Morel had a very bad time. For a week he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was in a critical condition.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) began to mend. And then, knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was going to get better, the
whole family sighed with relief, and proceeded to live happily.

<p/>They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital. There were
fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings from the sick
club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund; and then every week
the butties had something for Mrs. Morel--five or seven shillings--so
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was quite well to do. And whilst Morel was progressing
favourably in the hospital, the family was extraordinarily happy and
peaceful. On Saturdays and Wednesdays Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) always brought back some little thing: a small
tube of paints for Paul, or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for
Annie, that the whole family rejoiced over for days before the girl was
allowed to send them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty
wood. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) described her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) adventures into the big shops with joy. Soon the
folk in the picture-shop knew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and knew about Paul. The girl in
the book-shop took a keen interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Mrs. Morel was full of
information when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) got home from Nottingham. The three sat round till
bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing. Then Paul often raked the
fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm the man in the house now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) used to say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother with joy.
They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be. And they
almost regretted--though none of them would have owned to such
callousness--that their father was soon coming back.

<p/>Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was a rather small
and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and light blue eyes.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face had already lost its youthful chubbiness, and was becoming
somewhat like William's--rough-featured, almost rugged--and it was
extraordinarily mobile. Usually he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saw things, was full
of life, and warm; then his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) smile, like his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother's, came suddenly and
was very lovable; and then, when there was any clog in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) soul's quick
running, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face went stupid and ugly. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was the sort of boy that
becomes a clown and a lout as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is not understood, or feels
himself held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of
warmth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) suffered very much from the first contact with anything. When he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a torture to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).
But afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) liked it. And now that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had to go out into
life, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went through agonies of shrinking self-consciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
quite a clever painter for a boy of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knew some French
and German and mathematics that Mr. Heaton had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>). But nothing
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) had was of any commercial value. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) was not strong enough for heavy
manual work, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) mother said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) did not care for making things with his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>)
hands, preferred racing about, or making excursions into the country, or
reading, or painting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want to be?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) mother asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is no answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>But it was quite truthfully the only answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) could give. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) ambition,
as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) thirty or
thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home, and then, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>)
father died, have a cottage with his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) mother, paint and go out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>)
liked, and live happy ever after. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) programme as far as doing
things went. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) was proud within himself, measuring people against
himself, and placing them, inexorably. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) thought that PERHAPS he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>)
might also make a painter, the real thing. But that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) left alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``you must look in the paper for the
advertisements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) a bitter humiliation and an anguish
to go through. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) said nothing. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) got up in the morning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>)
whole being was knotted up over this one thought:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all joy and even
life, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) heart felt like a tight knot.

<p/>And then, at ten o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) set off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) was supposed to be a queer,
quiet child. Going up the sunny street of the little town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) felt as
if all the folk he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) met said to themselves: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s going to the Co-op.
reading-room to look in the papers for a place. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't get a job. I
suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s living on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) crept up the stone stairs
behind the drapery shop at the Co-op., and peeped in the reading-room.
Usually one or two men were there, either old, useless fellows, or
colliers <div class="bookquote">``on the club'' (<font color='red'><b>colliers</b></font>)</div>. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) entered, full of shrinking and suffering
when they looked up, seated himself at the table, and pretended to scan
the news. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) knew they would think: <div class="bookquote">``What does a lad of thirteen want in
a reading-room with a newspaper?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) suffered.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) looked wistfully out of the window. Already he (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) was a prisoner
of industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the old red wall of the
garden opposite, looking in their jolly way down on the women who
were hurrying with something for dinner. The valley was full of corn,
brightening in the sun. Two collieries, among the fields, waved their
small white plumes of steam. Far off on the hills were the woods of
Annesley, dark and fascinating. Already his (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) heart went down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) was
being taken into bondage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heaton</b></font>) freedom in the beloved home valley was
going now.

<p/>The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous barrels,
four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner, throned
aloft, rolling massively in his (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) seat, was not so much below Paul's eye.
The man's hair, on his (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) small, bullet head, was bleached almost white by
the sun, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) thick red arms, rocking idly on his (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) sack apron, the
white hairs glistened. His (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) red face shone and was almost asleep with
sunshine. The horses, handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking
by far the masters of the show.

<p/>Paul wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were stupid. <div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I was fat
like him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig and a brewer's
waggoner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, the room being at last empty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would hastily copy an
advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip out in immense
relief. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother would scan over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) copies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you may try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>William had written out a letter of application, couched in admirable
business language, which Paul copied, with variations. The boy's
handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all things well, got
into a fever of impatience.

<p/>The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
could associate with men far above his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) Bestwood friends in station. Some
of the clerks in the office had studied for the law, and were more or
less going through a kind of apprenticeship. William always made friends
among men wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was so jolly. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was soon
visiting and staying in houses of men who, in Bestwood, would have
looked down on the unapproachable bank manager, and would merely have
called indifferently on the Rector. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) began to fancy himself as a
great gun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) was, indeed, rather surprised at the ease with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>)
became a gentleman.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) mother was glad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) seemed so pleased. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) lodging in
Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind of fever
into the young man's letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unsettled by all the change, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not stand firm on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own feet, but seemed to spin rather giddily on the
quick current of the new life. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother was anxious for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could
feel him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) losing himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had danced and gone to the theatre, boated
on the river, been out with friends; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat up afterwards
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cold bedroom grinding away at Latin, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to get
on in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) office, and in the law as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never sent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mother any money now. It was all taken, the little he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
life. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not want any, except sometimes, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in a
tight corner, and when ten shillings would have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) much worry.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still dreamed of William, and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would do, with herself
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Never for a minute would she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) admit to herself how heavy and
anxious her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart was because of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>Also he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) talked a good deal now of a girl he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had met at a dance, a
handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men were
running thick and fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if you would run, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``unless
you saw all the other men chasing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) too. You feel safe enough and vain
enough in a crowd. But take care, and see how you feel when you find
yourself alone, and in triumph.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>William resented these things, and
continued the chase. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had taken the girl on the river. <div class="bookquote">``If you saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), mother, you would know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the
clearest of clear, transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet,
and such grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night. It
is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dresses
as well as any woman in London. I tell you, your son doesn't half put
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) head up when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) goes walking down Piccadilly with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel wondered, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son did not go walking down
Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes, rather than with
a woman who was near to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doubtful
fashion. And, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood over the washing-tub, the mother brooded over
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saddled with an elegant and expensive wife, earning
little money, dragging along and getting draggled in some small, ugly
house in a suburb. <div class="bookquote">``But there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told herself, <div class="bookquote">``I am very likely
a silly--meeting trouble halfway.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless, the load of anxiety
scarcely ever left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by
himself.

<p/>Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan, Manufacturer of
Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham. Mrs. Morel was all
joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes shining. <div class="bookquote">``You've only written four
letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky, my boy, as I always
said you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) felt alarmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) had not known that elastic stockings existed.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) seemed to feel the business world, with its regulated system of
values, and its impersonality, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) dreaded it. It seemed monstrous
also that a business could be run on wooden legs.

<p/>Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning. It was August and
blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up tight inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have suffered much physical pain rather than this unreasonable
suffering at being exposed to strangers, to be accepted or rejected. Yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chattered away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would never have confessed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) suffered over these things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only partly guessed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was gay, like a sweetheart. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood in front of the ticket-office at
Bestwood, and Paul watched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) take from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) purse the money for the
tickets. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands in their old black kid gloves getting the
silver out of the worn purse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart contracted with pain of love of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was quite excited, and quite gay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) suffered because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) WOULD talk
aloud in presence of the other travellers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look at that silly cow!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``careering round as if it
thought it was a circus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's most likely a bottfly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said very low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked brightly and unashamed.

<p/>They thought a while. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was sensible all the time of having her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Suddenly their eyes met, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)--a rare,
intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love. Then each looked out
of the window.

<p/>The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother and son
walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers having an
adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped to hang over the
parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just like Venice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrington</b></font>) said, seeing the sunshine on the water that
lay between high factory walls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered, smiling.

<p/>They enjoyed the shops immensely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you see that blouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``wouldn't that just suit our
Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And made of needlework as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrington</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town was strange
and delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside in a knot of
apprehension. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.

<p/>It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church. They turned up a
narrow street that led to the Castle. It was gloomy and old-fashioned,
having low dark shops and dark green house doors with brass knockers,
and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting on to the pavement; then another
old shop whose small window looked like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother
and son went cautiously, looking everywhere for <div class="bookquote">``Thomas Jordan and
Son'' (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>. It was like hunting in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of
excitement.

<p/>Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names of various
firms, Thomas Jordan among them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``But now WHERE is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory, on
the other a Commercial Hotel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's up the entry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws of the dragon.
They emerged into a wide yard, like a well, with buildings all round. It
was littered with straw and boxes, and cardboard. The sunshine actually
caught one crate whose straw was streaming on to the yard like gold. But
elsewhere the place was like a pit. There were several doors, and two
flights of steps. Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of
a staircase, loomed the ominous words <div class="bookquote">``Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical
Appliances.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel went first, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Charles I
mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere, and clerks,
with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about in an at-home
sort of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream parcels seemed
luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood. All was quiet and very
homely. Mrs. Morel took two steps forward, then waited. Paul stood
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) Sunday bonnet and a black veil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wore a
boy's broad white collar and a Norfolk suit.

<p/>One of the clerks looked up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was thin and tall, with a small face.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) way of looking was alert. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) glanced round to the other end of
the room, where was a glass office. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did
not say anything, but leaned in a gentle, inquiring fashion towards Mrs.
Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I see Mr. Jordan?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered old man
looked up. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog. Then the same little
man came up the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had short legs, was rather stout, and wore
an alpaca jacket. So, with one ear up, as it were, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came stoutly and
inquiringly down the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel, in doubt as to
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were a customer or not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to call
this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jordan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little manner
intended to be businesslike.

<p/>They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room, upholstered
in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of many customers.
On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather hoops tangled
together. They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the odour of new
wash-leather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wondered what the things were. By this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was so
much stunned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) only noticed the outside things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jordan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel to a
horse-hair chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion. Then the
little old man fidgeted and found a paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you write this letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snapped, thrusting what Paul recognised
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own notepaper in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling guilty
for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter; second, in
wondering why his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) letter seemed so strange and different, in the fat,
red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay on the kitchen
table. It was like part of himself, gone astray. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resented the way the
man held it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you learn to write?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man crossly.

<p/>Paul merely looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shamedly, and did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) IS a bad writer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>put in Mrs. Morel apologetically. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pushed
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) veil. Paul hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) for not being prouder with this common
little man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face clear of the veil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you say you know French?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>inquired the little man, still sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What school did you go to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Board-school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you learn it there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I--''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>The boy went crimson and got no farther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) godfather gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lessons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, half pleading and
rather distant.

<p/>Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) irritable manner--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) always seemed to
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) hands ready for action--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) pulled another sheet of paper from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) handed it
to Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting that the
boy could not decipher. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stared blankly at the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Monsieur,'''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began; then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked in great confusion at Mr. Jordan.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) wanted to say <div class="bookquote">``handwriting'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) wits would no longer work even
sufficiently to supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) with the word. Feeling an utter fool, and
hating Mr. Jordan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) turned desperately to the paper again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--`two pairs--gris

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) wanted to say <div class="bookquote">``handwriting'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>, but the word still refused to come.
Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings without TOES.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>flashed Paul, <div class="bookquote">''`doigts' means `fingers'--as well--as a rule--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>The little man looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know whether <div class="bookquote">``doigts''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>meant
<div class="bookquote">``fingers'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that for all HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purposes it meant <div class="bookquote">``toes'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fingers to stockings!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snapped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it DOES mean fingers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy persisted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hated the little man, who made such a clod of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Mr. Jordan looked
at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother, who sat quiet and
with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor who have to depend on the
favour of others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when could he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``as soon as you wish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) has finished school
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would live in Bestwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth to say another word,
after having insisted that <div class="bookquote">``doigts''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>meant <div class="bookquote">``fingers'' (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) followed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
mother down the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bright blue eyes full
of love and joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you'll like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Doigts' does mean `fingers', mother, and it was the writing. I
couldn't read the writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll be all right, and you won't see much
of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Wasn't that first young fellow nice? I'm sure you'll like them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) own it all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) was a workman who has got on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't mind
people so much. They're not being disagreeable to YOU--it's their way.
You always think people are meaning things for you. But they don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place the
blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market was a
row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples and piles of
reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas. There was a warm
scent of fruit as mother and son passed. Gradually his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) feeling of
ignominy and of rage sank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where should we go for dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother.

<p/>It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only been in an
eating-house once or twice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life, and then only to have a cup of
tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood considered that tea and
bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef, was all they could afford to
eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner was considered great extravagance.
Paul felt rather guilty.

<p/>They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel scanned
the bill of fare, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart was heavy, things were so dear. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We oughtn't to have come here, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We won't come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) having a small currant tart, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked
sweets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) insisted; <div class="bookquote">``you'll have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked round for the waitress. But the waitress was busy, and
Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) then. So the mother and son waited
for the girl's pleasure, whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flirted among the men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brazen hussy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel to Paul. <div class="bookquote">``Look now, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s taking that
man HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pudding, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came long after us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Mrs. Morel was angry. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was too poor, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) orders were too
meagre, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had not the courage to insist on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rights just
then. They waited and waited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should we go, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you bring one currant tart?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel clearly.

<p/>The girl looked round insolently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have waited quite long enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel asked coldly
for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) marvelled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mother's hardness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew that only years of battling had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to
insist even so little on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rights. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shrank as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the last time I go THERE for anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) declared, when they
were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one or two
places, shall we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel wanted to buy
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a little sable brush that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hankered after. But this indulgence he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
refused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood in front of milliners' shops and drapers' shops almost
bored, but content for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to be interested. They wandered on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, just look at those black grapes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They make your mouth
water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll have to wait a
bit before I get them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady in black
peering over the counter curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're looking at you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, trying to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stocks!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered, sniffing hastily. <div class="bookquote">``Look, there's a tubful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew stocks to smell
like it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) great relief, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moved out of the doorway, but
only to stand in front of the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), who was trying to get out of sight of the
elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. <div class="bookquote">``Paul! Just look here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came reluctantly back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, just look at that fuchsia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exclaimed, pointing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made a curious, interested sound. <div class="bookquote">``You'd think every second as
the flowers was going to fall off, they hang so big an' heavy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And such an abundance!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Lovely!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder who'll buy it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Not us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would die in our parlour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant you put
in, and the kitchen chokes them to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They bought a few things, and set off towards the station. Looking up
the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings, they saw the Castle
on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock, in a positive miracle of
delicate sunshine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``I can
go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>assented his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had spent a perfect afternoon with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. They arrived home in
the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

<p/>In the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) filled in the form for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) season-ticket and took it
to the station. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother was just beginning to wash
the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat crouched up on the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) says it'll be here on Saturday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how much will it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About one pound eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went on washing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) floor in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a lot?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no more than I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not answer, but went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) work. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That William promised me, when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went to London, as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'d give me a
pound a month. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I know
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hasn't a farthing if I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Not that I want it. Only just now
you'd think he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might be able to help with this ticket, which I'd never
expected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) earns a lot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike. They're
large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment you get.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) spends over fifty shillings a week on himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I keep this house on less than thirty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``and am
supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care about helping
you, once they've gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'d rather spend it on that dressed-up
creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should have her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own money if she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s so grand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should, but she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hasn't. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). And I know he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) doesn't buy her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought ME a gold bangle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>William was succeeding with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Gipsy'' (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>, as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked the
girl--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a photograph to send
to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette, taken in profile,
smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked, for on the photograph
not a scrap of clothing was to be seen, only a naked bust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>wrote Mrs. Morel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``the photograph of Louie is very
striking, and I can see she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must be attractive. But do you think, my
boy, it was very good taste of a girl to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) young man that photo
to send to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother--the first? Certainly the shoulders are beautiful,
as you say. But I hardly expected to see so much of them at the first
view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in the parlour. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
came out with it between his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) thick thumb and finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who dost reckon this is?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the girl our William is going with,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Morel.

<p/>``H'm! <div class="bookquote">``Er's a bright spark, from th' look on `er, an' one as wunna do

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name is Louisa Lily Denys Western.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' come again to-morrer!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the miner. <div class="bookquote">``An' is `er an

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) is not. She (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>)'s supposed to be a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll bet!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) exclaimed, still staring at the photo. <div class="bookquote">``A lady, is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?
An' how much does she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reckon ter keep up this sort o' game on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lives with an old aunt, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hates, and takes what
bit of money's given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel, laying down the photograph. <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a fool to ha'
ta'en up wi' such a one as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Mater,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>William replied. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry you didn't like the
photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you mightn't
think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite suit your prim
and proper notions, so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s going to send you another, that I hope
will please you better. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s always being photographed; in fact, the
photographers ask her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) if they may take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note from the
girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin evening bodice,
cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black lace hanging down her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
beautiful arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ever wears anything except evening clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Morel sarcastically. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I ought to be impressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are disagreeable, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``I think the first one with
bare shoulders is lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had the
season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) waistcoat pocket.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) loved it with its bars of yellow across. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother packed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dinner
in a small, shut-up basket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) set off at a quarter to seven to
catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came to the entry-end to see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) off.

<p/>It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender green fruits
that the children call <div class="bookquote">``pigeons''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>were twinkling gaily down on a little
breeze, into the front gardens of the houses. The valley was full of a
lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe corn shimmered, and in which
the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly. Puffs of wind came. Paul
looked over the high woods of Aldersley, where the country gleamed, and
home had never pulled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) so powerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) replied cheerfully and tenderly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) white apron on the open road, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
crossed the field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a small, compact body that looked full of
life. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) felt, as she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) trudging over the field, that where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
determined to go he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would get. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thought of William. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would have
leaped the fence instead of going round the stile. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was away in
London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had
two sons in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) could think of two places, great centres of
industry, and feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had put a man into each of them, that these
men would work out what SHE wanted; they were derived from her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), they
were of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), and their works also would be hers. All the morning long
she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thought of Paul.

<p/>At eight o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) climbed the dismal stairs of Jordan's Surgical
Appliance Factory, and stood helplessly against the first great
parcel-rack, waiting for somebody to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) up. The place was still
not awake. Over the counters were great dust sheets. Two men only had
arrived, and were heard talking in a corner, as they took off their
coats and rolled up their shirt-sleeves. It was ten past eight.
Evidently there was no rush of punctuality. Paul listened to the voices
of the two clerks. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard someone cough, and saw in the office
at the end of the room an old, decaying clerk, in a round smoking-cap of
black velvet embroidered with red and green, opening letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited
and waited. One of the junior clerks went to the old man, greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cheerily and loudly. Evidently the old <div class="bookquote">``chief''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was deaf. Then the young
fellow came striding importantly down to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) counter. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spied Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You the new lad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm! What's your name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul Morel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul Morel? All right, you come on round here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) round the rectangle of counters. The room was second
storey. It had a great hole in the middle of the floor, fenced as with a
wall of counters, and down this wide shaft the lifts went, and the light
for the bottom storey. Also there was a corresponding big, oblong hole
in the ceiling, and one could see above, over the fence of the top
floor, some machinery; and right away overhead was the glass roof, and
all light for the three storeys came downwards, getting dimmer, so that
it was always night on the ground floor and rather gloomy on the second
floor. The factory was the top floor, the warehouse the second, the
storehouse the ground floor. It was an insanitary, ancient place.

<p/>Paul was led round to a very dark corner.

<p/>``This is the ``Spiral' corner,'' said the clerk. <div class="bookquote">``You're Spiral, with
Pappleworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>)'s your boss, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>)'s not come yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) doesn't get here
till half-past eight. So you can fetch the letters, if you like, from
Mr. Melling down there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man pointed to the old clerk in the office.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a peg to hang your cap on. Here are your entry ledgers. Mr.
Pappleworth won't be long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man strides</b></font>)</div><p/>And the thin young man stalked away with long, busy strides over the
hollow wooden floor.

<p/>After a minute or two Paul went down and stood in the door of the glass
office. The old clerk in the smoking-cap looked down over the rim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, kindly and impressively. <div class="bookquote">``You want the letters
for the Spiral department, Thomas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul resented being called <div class="bookquote">``Thomas'' (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took the letters and
returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dark place, where the counter made an angle, where the
great parcel-rack came to an end, and where there were three doors in
the corner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat on a high stool and read the letters--those whose
handwriting was not too difficult. They ran as follows:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you please send me at once a pair of lady's silk spiral
thigh-hose, without feet, such as I had from you last year; length,
thigh to knee, etc.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Or, <div class="bookquote">``Major Chamberlain wishes to repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>)
previous order for a silk non-elastic suspensory bandage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Many of these letters, some of them in French or Norwegian, were a great
puzzle to the boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stool nervously awaiting the arrival
of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``boss'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suffered tortures of shyness when, at half-past eight,
the factory girls for upstairs trooped past him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Pappleworth arrived, chewing a chlorodyne gum, at about twenty to
nine, when all the other men were at work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) was a thin, sallow man
with a red nose, quick, staccato, and smartly but stiffly dressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>)
was about thirty-six years old. There was something rather <div class="bookquote">``doggy'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>,
rather smart, rather `cute and shrewd, and something warm, and something
slightly contemptible about him (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You my new lad?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) said.

<p/>Paul stood up and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetched the letters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pappleworth gave a chew to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) gum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Copied 'em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, come on then, let's look slippy. Changed your coat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to bring an old coat and leave it here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) pronounced the
last words with the chlorodyne gum between his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) side teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) vanished
into the darkness behind the great parcel-rack, reappeared coatless,
turning up a smart striped shirt-cuff over a thin and hairy arm. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) slipped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) coat. Paul noticed how thin he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
trousers were in folds behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seized a stool, dragged it beside the
boy's, and sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Paul took a seat.

<p/>Mr. Pappleworth was very close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>). The man seized the letters,
snatched a long entry-book out of a rack in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>), flung it open,
seized a pen, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look here. You want to copy these letters in here.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) sniffed
twice, gave a quick chew at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) gum, stared fixedly at a letter,
then went very still and absorbed, and wrote the entry rapidly, in a
beautiful flourishing hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) glanced quickly at Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think you can do it all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right then, let's see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sprang off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stool. Paul took a pen. Mr. Pappleworth disappeared.
Paul rather liked copying the letters, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wrote slowly, laboriously,
and exceedingly badly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was doing the fourth letter, and feeling quite
busy and happy, when Mr. Pappleworth reappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, how`r' yer getting on? Done 'em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) leaned over the boy's shoulder, chewing, and smelling of chlorodyne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strike my bob, lad, but you're a beautiful writer!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) exclaimed
satirically. <div class="bookquote">``Ne'er mind, how many h`yer done? Only three! I'd 'a eaten
'em. Get on, my lad, an' put numbers on 'em. Here, look! Get on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul ground away at the letters, whilst Mr. Pappleworth fussed over
various jobs. Suddenly the boy started as a shrill whistle sounded near
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) ear. Mr. Pappleworth came, took a plug out of a pipe, and said, in
an amazingly cross and bossy voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul heard a faint voice, like a woman's, out of the mouth of the tube.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gazed in wonder, never having seen a speaking-tube before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pappleworth disagreeably into the tube, <div class="bookquote">``you'd better
get some of your back work done, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the woman's tiny voice was heard, sounding pretty and cross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not time to stand here while you talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pappleworth, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) pushed the plug into the tube.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) said imploringly to Paul, <div class="bookquote">``there's Polly crying out
for them orders. Can't you buck up a bit? Here, come out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took the book, to Paul's immense chagrin, and began the copying
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) worked quickly and well. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seized some strips
of long yellow paper, about three inches wide, and made out the day's
orders for the work-girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better watch me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to Paul, working all the while rapidly.
Paul watched the weird little drawings of legs, and thighs, and ankles,
with the strokes across and the numbers, and the few brief directions
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chief made upon the yellow paper. Then Mr. Pappleworth
finished and jumped up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) said, and the yellow papers flying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) hands,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) dashed through a door and down some stairs, into the basement where
the gas was burning. They crossed the cold, damp storeroom, then a
long, dreary room with a long table on trestles, into a smaller, cosy
apartment, not very high, which had been built on to the main building.
In this room a small woman with a red serge blouse, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) black hair
done on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, was waiting like a proud little bantam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here y'are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Pappleworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is `here you are'!''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Polly. <div class="bookquote">``The girls have been
here nearly half an hour waiting. Just think of the time wasted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU think of getting your work done and not talking so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Pappleworth. <div class="bookquote">``You could ha' been finishing off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know quite well we finished everything off on Saturday!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried
Pony, flying at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) dark eyes flashing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tu-tu-tu-tu-terterter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) mocked. <div class="bookquote">``Here's your new lad. Don't ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
as you did the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As we did the last!''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>repeated Polly. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, WE do a lot of ruining, we
do. My word, a lad would TAKE some ruining after he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d been with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's time for work now, not for talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pappleworth severely
and coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was time for work some time back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>said Polly, marching away with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) head in the air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was an erect little body of forty.

<p/>In that room were two round spiral machines on the bench under the
window. Through the inner doorway was another longer room, with six more
machines. A little group of girls, nicely dressed in white aprons, stood
talking together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you nothing else to do but talk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pappleworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only wait for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>said one handsome girl, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, get on, get on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, my lad. You'll know your road
down here again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>And Paul ran upstairs after his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was given some checking
and invoicing to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood at the desk, labouring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) execrable
handwriting. Presently Mr. Jordan came strutting down from the glass
office and stood behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>), to the boy's great discomfort. Suddenly a
red and fat finger was thrust on the form he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) was filling in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``MR. J. A. Bates, Esquire!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the cross voice just behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>)
ear.

<p/>Paul looked at <div class="bookquote">``Mr. J. A. Bates, Esquire''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own vile writing, and
wondered what was the matter now.

<p/>``Didn't they teach you any better THAN that while they were at it? If
you put ``Mr.<div class="bookquote">'' you don't put Esquire'-a man can't be both at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy regretted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too-much generosity in disposing of honours,
hesitated, and with trembling fingers, scratched out the <div class="bookquote">``Mr.''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>Then all
at once Mr. Jordan snatched away the invoice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make another! Are you going to send that to a gentleman?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) tore
up the blue form irritably.

<p/>Paul, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ears red with shame, began again. Still Mr. Jordan watched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what they DO teach in schools. You'll have to write better
than that. Lads learn nothing nowadays, but how to recite poetry
and play the fiddle. Have you seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) writing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) asked of Mr.
Pappleworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; prime, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Pappleworth indifferently.

<p/>Mr. Jordan gave a little grunt, not unamiable. Paul divined that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
master's bark was worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bite. Indeed, the little manufacturer,
although he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spoke bad English, was quite gentleman enough to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
men alone and to take no notice of trifles. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not
look like the boss and owner of the show, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to play his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) role of
proprietor at first, to put things on a right footing.

<p/>``Let's see, WHAT<div class="bookquote">``S your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Pappleworth of the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul Morel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>It is curious that children suffer so much at having to pronounce their
own names.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul Morel, is it? All right, you Paul-Morel through them things there,
and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pappleworth subsided on to a stool, and began writing. A girl came
up from out of a door just behind, put some newly-pressed elastic web
appliances on the counter, and returned. Mr. Pappleworth picked up the
whitey-blue knee-band, examined it, and its yellow order-paper quickly,
and put it on one side. Next was a flesh-pink <div class="bookquote">``leg'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) went through
the few things, wrote out a couple of orders, and called to Paul to
accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). This time they went through the door whence the girl had
emerged. There Paul found himself at the top of a little wooden flight
of steps, and below him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw a room with windows round two sides, and at
the farther end half a dozen girls sitting bending over the benches
in the light from the window, sewing. They were singing together <div class="bookquote">``Two
Little Girls in Blue'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>. Hearing the door opened, they all turned round,
to see Mr. Pappleworth and Paul looking down on them from the far end of
the room. They stopped singing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you make a bit less row?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pappleworth. <div class="bookquote">``Folk'll think we
keep cats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div><p/>A hunchback woman on a high stool turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long, rather heavy face
towards Mr. Pappleworth, and said, in a contralto voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're all tom-cats then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>contralto</b></font>)</div><p/>In vain Mr. Pappleworth tried to be impressive for Paul's benefit.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) descended the steps into the finishing-off room, and went to the
hunchback Fanny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had such a short body on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) high stool that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
head, with its great bands of bright brown hair, seemed over large, as
did her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pale, heavy face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wore a dress of green-black cashmere, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wrists, coming out of the narrow cuffs, were thin and flat, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work nervously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) something that was wrong with
a knee-cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you needn't come blaming it on to me. It's not my
fault.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) colour mounted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said it WAS your fault. Will you do as I tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>replied Mr.
Pappleworth shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say it's my fault, but you'd like to make out as it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>hunchback</b></font>)</div>the
hunchback woman cried, almost in tears. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) snatched the knee-cap
from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``boss'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'll do it for you, but you needn't be
snappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's your new lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pappleworth.

<p/>Fanny turned, smiling very gently on Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; don't make a softy of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) between you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not us as `ud make a softy of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on then, Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pappleworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Au revoy, Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>said one of the girls.

<p/>There was a titter of laughter. Paul went out, blushing deeply, not
having spoken a word.

<p/>The day was very long. All morning the work-people were coming to speak
to Mr. Pappleworth. Paul was writing or learning to make up parcels,
ready for the midday post. At one o'clock, or, rather, at a quarter to
one, Mr. Pappleworth disappeared to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) train: he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) lived in the
suburbs. At one o'clock, Paul, feeling very lost, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dinner-basket
down into the stockroom in the basement, that had the long table on
trestles, and ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) meal hurriedly, alone in that cellar of gloom and
desolation. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went out of doors. The brightness and the freedom of
the streets made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feel adventurous and happy. But at two o'clock
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was back in the corner of the big room. Soon the work-girls went
trooping past, making remarks. It was the commoner girls who worked
upstairs at the heavy tasks of truss-making and the finishing of
artificial limbs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited for Mr. Pappleworth, not knowing what to do,
sitting scribbling on the yellow order-paper. Mr. Pappleworth came at
twenty minutes to three. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) sat and gossiped with Paul, treating
the boy entirely as an equal, even in age.

<p/>In the afternoon there was never very much to do, unless it were near
the week-end, and the accounts had to be made up. At five o'clock all
the men went down into the dungeon with the table on trestles, and there
they had tea, eating bread-and-butter on the bare, dirty boards, talking
with the same kind of ugly haste and slovenliness with which they ate
their meal. And yet upstairs the atmosphere among them was always jolly
and clear. The cellar and the trestles affected them.

<p/>After tea, when all the gases were lighted, WORK went more briskly.
There was the big evening post to get off. The hose came up warm and
newly pressed from the workrooms. Paul had made out the invoices. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had the packing up and addressing to do, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to weigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stock
of parcels on the scales. Everywhere voices were calling weights, there
was the chink of metal, the rapid snapping of string, the hurrying to
old Mr. Melling for stamps. And at last the postman came with his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) sack,
laughing and jolly. Then everything slacked off, and Paul took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
dinner-basket and ran to the station to catch the eight-twenty train.
The day in the factory was just twelve hours long.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother sat waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rather anxiously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to walk from
Keston, so was not home until about twenty past nine. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left the
house before seven in the morning. Mrs. Morel was rather anxious about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) health. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) herself had had to put up with so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) children to take the same odds. They must go through with
what came. And Paul stayed at Jordan's, although all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
there his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) health suffered from the darkness and lack of air and the long
hours.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came in pale and tired. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
rather pleased, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anxiety all went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever so funny, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``You don't have to work a bit hard,
and they're nice with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you get on all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: they only say my writing's bad. But Mr. Pappleworth--he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>)'s my
man--said to Mr. Jordan I should be all right. I'm Spiral, mother; you
must come and see. It's ever so nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked Jordan's. Mr. Pappleworth, who had a certain <div class="bookquote">``saloon bar''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>flavour about him (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>), was always natural, and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) had been
a comrade. Sometimes the <div class="bookquote">``Spiral boss''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was irritable, and chewed more
lozenges than ever. Even then, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) was not offensive, but one
of those people who hurt themselves by their own irritability more than
they hurt other people.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you done that YET?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) would cry. <div class="bookquote">``Go on, be a month of
Sundays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Again, and Paul could understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) least then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was jocular and in
high spirits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to bring my little Yorkshire terrier bitch tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said
jubilantly to Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a Yorkshire terrier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``DON'T know what a Yorkshire terrier is? DON<div class="bookquote">``T KNOW A YORKSHIRE--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Pappleworth was aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a little silky one--colours of iron and rusty silver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``THAT'S it, my lad. She (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>)'s a gem. She (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>)'s had five pounds' worth of pups
already, and she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>)'s worth over seven pounds herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) doesn't
weigh twenty ounces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bitch</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day the bitch came. She (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) was a shivering, miserable morsel. Paul
did not care for her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) seemed so like a wet rag that would never
dry. Then a man called for her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>), and began to make coarse jokes. But Mr.
Pappleworth nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) head in the direction of the boy, and the talk
went on _sotto voce_.

<p/>Mr. Jordan only made one more excursion to watch Paul, and then the only
fault he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found was seeing the boy lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pen on the counter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put your pen in your ear, if you're going to be a clerk. Pen in your
ear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to the lad: <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you hold your shoulders
straighter? Come down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) into the glass office and
fitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with special braces for keeping the shoulders square.

<p/>But Paul liked the girls best. The men seemed common and rather dull.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked them all, but they were uninteresting. Polly, the little brisk
overseer downstairs, finding Paul eating in the cellar, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>)
could cook him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) anything on her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) little stove. Next day his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a dish that could be heated up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took it into the pleasant, clean
room to Polly. And very soon it grew to be an established custom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
should have dinner with her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came in at eight in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) basket to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came down at one o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
dinner ready.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was not very tall, and pale, with thick chestnut hair, irregular
features, and a wide, full mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was like a small bird. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) often
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``robinet'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>. Though naturally rather quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would sit and
chatter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) for hours telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) home. The girls all
liked to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talk. They often gathered in a little circle while he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
sat on a bench, and held forth to them, laughing. Some of them regarded
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as a curious little creature, so serious, yet so bright and jolly,
and always so delicate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) way with them. They all liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
adored them. Polly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) belonged to. Then Connie, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) mane of
red hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) face of apple-blossom, her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) murmuring voice, such a lady in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) shabby black frock, appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) romantic side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you sit winding,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, ``it looks as if you were spinning at
a spinning-wheel--it looks ever so nice. You remind me of Elaine in the
<div class="bookquote">``Idylls of the King'. I'd draw you if I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blushing shyly. And later on he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a sketch
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) prized very much: Connie sitting on the stool before the wheel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>)
flowing mane of red hair on her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) rusty black frock, her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) red mouth shut
and serious, running the scarlet thread off the hank on to the reel.

<p/>With Louie, handsome and brazen, who always seemed to thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) hip at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) usually joked.

<p/>Emma was rather plain, rather old, and condescending. But to condescend
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) happy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) did not mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you put needles in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away and don't bother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I ought to know how to put needles in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ground at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) machine all the while steadily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are many things you ought to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, then, how to stick needles in the machine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the boy, what a nuisance he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is! Why, THIS is how you do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attentively. Suddenly a whistle piped. Then Polly
appeared, and said in a clear voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pappleworth wants to know how much longer you're going to be down
here playing with the girls, Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul flew upstairs, calling <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>and Emma drew herself up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't ME who wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to play with the machine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/>As a rule, when all the girls came back at two o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ran upstairs
to Fanny, the hunchback, in the finishing-off room. Mr. Pappleworth
did not appear till twenty to three, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) often found his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) boy sitting
beside Fanny, talking, or drawing, or singing with the girls.

<p/>Often, after a minute's hesitation, Fanny would begin to sing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had a
fine contralto voice. Everybody joined in the chorus, and it went well.
Paul was not at all embarrassed, after a while, sitting in the room with
the half a dozen work-girls.

<p/>At the end of the song Fanny would say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you've been laughing at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be so soft, Fanny!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>cried one of the girls.

<p/>Once there was mention of Connie's red hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny's is better, to my fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't try to make a fool of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, flushing deeply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has, Paul; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'s got beautiful hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a treat of a colour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That coldish colour like earth,
and yet shiny. It's like bog-water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness me!''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>exclaimed one girl, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I do but get criticised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you should see it down, Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>cried Emma earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``It's simply
beautiful. Put it down for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), Fanny, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wants something to paint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny would not, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll take it down myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) carefully took the pins out of the knot, and the rush of hair, of
uniform dark brown, slid over the humped back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a lovely lot!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>The girls watched. There was silence. The youth shook the hair loose
from the coil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, smelling its perfume. <div class="bookquote">``I'll bet it's worth
pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave it you when I die, Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, half joking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look just like anybody else, sitting drying their hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>said one
of the girls to the long-legged hunchback.

<p/>Poor Fanny was morbidly sensitive, always imagining insults. Polly was
curt and businesslike. The two departments were for ever at war, and
Paul was always finding Fanny in tears. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was made the recipient
of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) woes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to plead her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) case with Polly.

<p/>So the time went along happily enough. The factory had a homely feel.
No one was rushed or driven. Paul always enjoyed it when the work got
faster, towards post-time, and all the men united in labour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked to
watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fellow-clerks at work. The man was the work and the work was
the man, one thing, for the time being. It was different with the girls.
The real woman never seemed to be there at the task, but as if left out,
waiting.

<p/>From the train going home at night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to watch the lights of the
town, sprinkled thick on the hills, fusing together in a blaze in the
valleys. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt rich in life and happy. Drawing farther off, there was
a patch of lights at Bulwell like myriad petals shaken to the ground
from the shed stars; and beyond was the red glare of the furnaces,
playing like hot breath on the clouds.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to walk two and more miles from Keston home, up two long hills,
down two short hills. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was often tired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) counted the lamps
climbing the hill above him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), how many more to pass. And from the
hilltop, on pitch-dark nights, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round on the villages five
or six miles away, that shone like swarms of glittering living things,
almost a heaven against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet. Marlpool and Heanor scattered the
far-off darkness with brilliance. And occasionally the black valley
space between was traced, violated by a great train rushing south to
London or north to Scotland. The trains roared by like projectiles level
on the darkness, fuming and burning, making the valley clang with
their passage. They were gone, and the lights of the towns and villages
glittered in silence.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to the corner at home, which faced the other side
of the night. The ash-tree seemed a friend now. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother rose with
gladness as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eight shillings proudly on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll help, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked wistfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's precious little left,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``after your ticket and
dinners and such are taken off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the budget of the day. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life-story, like an Arabian
Nights, was told night after night to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother. It was almost as if it
were her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own life.



<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>DEATH IN THE FAMILY

<p/>ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was a quick, careless, impulsive boy, a
good deal like his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hated study, made a great moan if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sport again.

<p/>In appearance he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remained the flower of the family, being well made,
graceful, and full of life. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dark brown hair and fresh colouring, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes, together with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
generous manner and fiery temper, made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a favourite. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) grew
older his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) temper became uncertain. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) flew into rages over nothing,
seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) loved, wearied of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sometimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought only of
himself. When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wanted amusement, all that stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
hated, even if it were she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was in trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) moaned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
ceaselessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness, boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) groaned about a master who, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said,
hated him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you don't like it, alter it, and if you can't alter it,
put up with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had loved and who had worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came
to detest. As he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) body, which
had been beautiful in movement and in being, shrank, did not seem to
ripen with the years, but to get mean and rather despicable. There came
over him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a look of meanness and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking
elderly man bullied or ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious.
Moreover, Morel's manners got worse and worse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) habits somewhat
disgusting. When the children were growing up and in the crucial stage
of adolescence, the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls.
His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manners in the house were the same as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used among the colliers
down pit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dirty nuisance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/ARTHUR</b></font>)</div>Arthur would cry, jumping up and going straight out
of the house when his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). And Morel persisted the more
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) children hated it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) seemed to take a kind of satisfaction
in disgusting them, and driving them nearly mad, while they were so
irritably sensitive at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur,
who was growing up when his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father was degenerate and elderly, hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
worst of all.

<p/>Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous hatred
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not a man tries harder for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would shout. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best for them, and then gets treated like a dog. But I'm not
going to stand it, I tell you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But for the threat and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not try so hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle now went on
nearly all between father and children, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) persisting in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dirty and
disgusting ways, just to assert his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) independence. They loathed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) won a
scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother decided
to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) live in town, with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sisters, and only come home at
week-ends.

<p/>Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning about four
shillings a week. But soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would have fifteen shillings, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) examination, and there would be financial peace in the
house.

<p/>Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was quiet and not brilliant. But still
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) painting, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. Everything
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did was for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) coming home in the evening, and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unburdened herself of all she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had pondered, or of all that
had occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) during the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat and listened with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
earnestness. The two shared lives.

<p/>William was engaged now to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) brunette, and had bought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) an
engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped at such a
fabulous price.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eight guineas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``More fool him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)! If he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'d gen me some on't,
it `ud ha' looked better on `im.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Given YOU some of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Why give YOU some of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) remembered HE (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had bought no engagement ring at all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
preferred William, who was not mean, if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) were foolish. But now the
young man talked only of the dances to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) betrothed,
and the different resplendent clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wore; or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother
with glee how they went to the theatre like great swells.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) should come at the
Christmas. This time William arrived with a lady, but with no presents.
Mrs. Morel had prepared supper. Hearing footsteps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rose and went to
the door. William entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hastily, then stood aside to present a
tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine black-and-white
check, and furs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Gyp!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Western held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) teeth in a small smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you will be hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A frown went over his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) glanced round
the kitchen. It was small and curious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), with its glittering
kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures, its wooden chairs and
little deal table. At that moment Morel came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, dad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>The two shook hands, and William presented the lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) gave the same
smile that showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Morel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel bowed obsequiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself very
welcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied, rather amused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will like to go upstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up this box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't be an hour dressing yourself up,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
betrothed.

<p/>Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak, preceded
the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel had
vacated for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). It, too, was small and cold by candlelight. The
colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I unstrap the box?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>asked Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you very much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'s rather tired, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``It's a beastly
journey, and we had such a rush.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything I can give her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'ll be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour Miss Western
came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress, very fine for the
collier's kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you you'd no need to change,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Chubby!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) turned with that sweetish smile to Mrs. Morel.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'s always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``That's not very nice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't, really!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you come near the fire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel jumped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) armchair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and sit you here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Come and sit you here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Morel. <div class="bookquote">``This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here, Miss
Wesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl place</b></font>)</div>said the girl, seating herself in the collier's
armchair, the place of honour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shivered, feeling the warmth of the
kitchen penetrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mouth to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>),
and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone; which made the
rest of the family feel as if they ought not to be present. The young
lady evidently did not realise them as people: they were creatures to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for the present. William winced.

<p/>In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been a lady
condescending to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) inferiors. These people were to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), certainly
clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to adjust herself?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/>Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken. But when the
girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank
you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in a gracious way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been so
poor; about London, about dances. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was really very nervous, and
chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) thick twist
tobacco, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), and listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) glib London speech, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) best black silk blouse, answered
quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat round in silence and
admiration. Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the best was
got out for her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>): the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth,
the best coffee-jug. The children thought she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) must find it quite grand.
She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt strange, not able to realise the people, not knowing how to
treat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

<p/>At about ten o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you tired, Gyp?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather, Chubby,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) answered, at once in the intimate tones and
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) head slightly on one side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll light her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) the candle, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>replied the mother.

<p/>Miss Western stood up, held out her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hand to Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mrs. Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap into a stone
beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel pit-singlet, and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother good-night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was to share the room with the lady,
because the house was full.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat nursing
the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round, to everybody's
discomfort, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) departure, preceded by William. In five minutes
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was downstairs again. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heart was rather sore; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not know why.
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) talked very little till everybody had gone to bed, but himself and
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) legs apart, in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) old attitude on
the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the slow answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s shy yet, mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s not used to it. It's different from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
aunt's house, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is, my boy; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) must find it difficult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) does.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) frowned swiftly. <div class="bookquote">``If only she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wouldn't put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
BLESSED airs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) first awkwardness, my boy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'ll be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) replied gratefully. But his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) brow was gloomy.
<div class="bookquote">``You know, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not like you, mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not serious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can't
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s young, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s had no sort of show. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother died when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a
child. Since then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) aunt, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can't bear. And
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father was a rake. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s had no love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Well, you must make up to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so--you have to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a lot of things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``WHAT do you have to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), my boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seems shallow, you have to remember she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s never had
anybody to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deeper side out. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s FEARFULLY fond of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anybody can see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you know, mother--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s different from us. Those sort of
people, like those she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lives amongst, they don't seem to have the same
principles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't judge too hastily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed uneasy within himself.

<p/>In the morning, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was up singing and larking round the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) called, sitting on the stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Are you getting up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) voice called faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shouted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not
come down in half an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) REALLY getting up when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked of Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>replied Annie.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy New Year,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) called.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Chubby dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the laughing voice, far away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buck up!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) implored.

<p/>It was nearly an hour, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). Morel, who
always rose before six, looked at the clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's a winder!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>The family had breakfasted, all but William. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went to the foot of the
stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) called, rather
crossly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) only laughed. The family expected, after that time of
preparation, something like magic. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came, looking very nice
in a blouse and skirt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it, Mrs. Morel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) played the grand lady at first. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went with William
to chapel, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) frock-coat and silk hat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) furs and
London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected everybody to bow
to the ground in admiration. And Morel, standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) Sunday suit
at the end of the road, watching the gallant pair go, felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was the
father of princes and princesses.

<p/>And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was not so grand. For a year now she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had been a sort of
secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was with the Morels
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) queened it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat and let Annie or Paul wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) as if they
were her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) servants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) treated Mrs. Morel with a certain glibness and
Morel with patronage. But after a day or so she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) began to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
tune.

<p/>William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them on their
walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really DID admire
<div class="bookquote">``Gipsy''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>wholeheartedly; in fact, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother scarcely forgave the boy for
the adulation with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) treated the girl.

<p/>On the second day, when Lily said: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Annie, do you know where I left
my muff?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Louisa Lily Denys Western</b></font>)</div>William replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it angered the
young man that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) made a servant of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sister.

<p/>On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together in the
parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven Mrs. Morel was
heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen, followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
beloved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it as late as that, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had been sitting alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you go to bed, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you trust us, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven if you
like, and I can read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to bed, Gyp,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) girl. <div class="bookquote">``We won't keep mater waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Annie has left the candle burning, Lily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel; <div class="bookquote">``I think you
will see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>William kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sweetheart at the foot of the stairs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went.
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) returned to the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you trust us, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) repeated, rather offended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young things like you
alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was forced to take this answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother good-night.

<p/>At Easter he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came over alone. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) discussed his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sweetheart
endlessly with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, mother, when I'm away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I don't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a bit. I
shouldn't care if I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again. But, then, when I'm with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in
the evenings I am awfully fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a queer sort of love to marry on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) holds
you no more than that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS funny!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But
yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``But if it is as you say, I wouldn't
call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know, mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s an orphan, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>They never came to any sort of conclusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed puzzled and rather
fretted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was rather reserved. All his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) strength and money went
in keeping this girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could scarcely afford to take his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother to
Nottingham when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came over.

<p/>Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings, to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) great
joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was quite happy at Jordan's, but his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) health suffered from the
long hours and the confinement. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) became more and
more significant, thought how to help.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday morning in
May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it will be a fine day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked up in surprise. This meant something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) asked me
last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers, and I promised to bring
you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, little woman, how lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``And we'll go this
afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road was a
cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the Statutes ground
burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green. And the steep swoop
of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust, splendid with patterns of
sunshine and shadow, perfectly still. The trees sloped their great green
shoulders proudly; and inside the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came home at dinner-time his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother was rather excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we going?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I'm ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied.

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and get dressed while I wash up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did so. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) washed the pots, straightened, and then took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boots.
They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally exquisite
people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes. But Paul had to
clean them for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). They were kid boots at eight shillings a pair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
however, thought them the most dainty boots in the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cleaned
them with as much reverence as if they had been flowers.

<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had got a
new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my stars!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``What a bobby-dazzler!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It's very quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) walked forward, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hovered round her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high and mighty, <div class="bookquote">``do
you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went and surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) from the back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, ``if I was walking down the street behind you, I should
say: <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not sure it suits her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was wrapped in
burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sniffed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) little way, pleased, but pretending to know better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's cost me just three shillings. You couldn't have
got it ready-made for that price, could you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, you know, it's good stuff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Awfully pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too young for me, though, I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too young for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed in disgust. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you buy some
false white hair and stick it on your head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll soon have no need,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going white fast enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you've no business to,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What do I want with a
white-haired mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said rather
strangely.

<p/>They set off in great style, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) carrying the umbrella William had given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller than she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was not big. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fancied himself.

<p/>On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit waved its
plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look at that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on the road to
watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled a little group
in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck, and a man. They
climbed the incline against the heavens. At the end the man tipped the
wagon. There was an undue rattle as the waste fell down the sheer slope
of the enormous bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You sit a minute, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took a seat on a bank,
whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sketched rapidly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was silent whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked, looking
round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among their greenness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The world is a wonderful place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and wonderfully beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so's the pit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Look how it heaps together, like something
alive almost--a big creature that you don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts to be
fed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And very thankful I am they ARE standing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for that means
they'll turn middling time this week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I like the feel of MEN on things, while they're alive. There's a
feel of men about trucks, because they've been handled with men's hands,
all of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>They went along under the trees of the highroad. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was constantly
informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was interested. They passed the end of
Nethermere, that was tossing its sunshine like petals lightly in
its lap. Then they turned on a private road, and in some trepidation
approached a big farm. A dog barked furiously. A woman came out to see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this the way to Willey Farm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel asked.

<p/>Paul hung behind in terror of being sent back. But the woman was
amiable, and directed them. The mother and son went through the wheat
and oats, over a little bridge into a wild meadow. Peewits, with their
white breasts glistening, wheeled and screamed about them. The lake was
still and blue. High overhead a heron floated. Opposite, the wood heaped
on the hill, green and still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a wild road, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``Just like Canada.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it beautiful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, looking round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See that heron--see--see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) legs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) must see and what not. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
quite content.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``which way? He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) told me through the wood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The wood, fenced and dark, lay on their left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can feel a bit of a path this road,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``You've got town
feet, somehow or other, you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They found a little gate, and soon were in a broad green alley of the
wood, with a new thicket of fir and pine on one hand, an old oak glade
dipping down on the other. And among the oaks the bluebells stood in
pools of azure, under the new green hazels, upon a pale fawn floor of
oak-leaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found flowers for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a bit of new-mown hay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; then, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
forget-me-nots. And, again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart hurt with love, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand,
used with work, holding the little bunch of flowers he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
perfectly happy.

<p/>But at the end of the riding was a fence to climb. Paul was over in a
second.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``let me help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, go away. I will do it in my own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood below with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands up ready to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) climbed
cautiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a way to climb!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed scornfully, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was safely to
earth again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hateful stiles!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Duffer of a little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``who can't get over 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In front, along the edge of the wood, was a cluster of low red farm
buildings. The two hastened forward. Flush with the wood was the apple
orchard, where blossom was falling on the grindstone. The pond was deep
under a hedge and overhanging oak trees. Some cows stood in the shade.
The farm and buildings, three sides of a quadrangle, embraced the
sunshine towards the wood. It was very still.

<p/>Mother and son went into the small railed garden, where was a scent
of red gillivers. By the open door were some floury loaves, put out to
cool. A hen was just coming to peck them. Then, in the doorway suddenly
appeared a girl in a dirty apron. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was about fourteen years old, had
a rosy dark face, a bunch of short black curls, very fine and free, and
dark eyes; shy, questioning, a little resentful of the strangers, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
disappeared. In a minute another figure appeared, a small, frail woman,
rosy, with great dark brown eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed, smiling with a little glow, <div class="bookquote">``you've come, then. I
AM glad to see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice was intimate and rather sad.

<p/>The two women shook hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now are you sure we're not a bother to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I know
what a farming life is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! We're only too thankful to see a new face, it's so lost up
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>They were taken through into the parlour--a long, low room, with a great
bunch of guelder-roses in the fireplace. There the women talked, whilst
Paul went out to survey the land. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was in the garden smelling the
gillivers and looking at the plants, when the girl came out quickly to
the heap of coal which stood by the fence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose these are cabbage-roses?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), pointing to the
bushes along the fence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with startled, big brown eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they are cabbage-roses when they come out?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) faltered. <div class="bookquote">``They're white with pink middles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they're maiden-blush.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam flushed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had a beautiful warm colouring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't have MUCH in your garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is our first year here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered, in a distant, rather
superior way, drawing back and going indoors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not notice, but
went his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) round of exploration. Presently his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother came out, and they
went through the buildings. Paul was hugely delighted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look after?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel to Mrs. Leivers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the little woman. <div class="bookquote">``I can't find time to look after cattle,
and I'm not used to it. It's as much as I can do to keep going in the
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>Presently the girl came out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea is ready, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said in a musical, quiet voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you, Miriam, then we'll come,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mother, almost
ingratiatingly. <div class="bookquote">``Would you CARE to have tea now, Mrs. Morel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Whenever it's ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother and Mrs. Leivers had tea together. Then they
went out into the wood that was flooded with bluebells, while fumy
forget-me-nots were in the paths. The mother and son were in ecstasy
together.

<p/>When they got back to the house, Mr. Leivers and Edgar, the eldest
son, were in the kitchen. Edgar was about eighteen. Then Geoffrey and
Maurice, big lads of twelve and thirteen, were in from school. Mr.
Leivers was a good-looking man in the prime of life, with a golden-brown
moustache, and blue eyes screwed up against the weather.

<p/>The boys were condescending, but Paul scarcely observed it. They went
round for eggs, scrambling into all sorts of places. As they were
feeding the fowls Miriam came out. The boys took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). One
hen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) yellow chickens, was in a coop. Maurice took his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) hand full
of corn and let the hen peck from it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Durst you do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) asked of Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a small hand, warm, and rather capable-looking. Miriam watched.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held the corn to the hen. The bird eyed it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hard, bright eye,
and suddenly made a peck into his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) started, and laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Rap,
rap, rap!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went the bird's beak in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) palm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed again, and the
other boys joined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knocks you, and nips you, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) never hurts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, when the
last corn had gone. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Miriam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maurice</b></font>)</div>said Maurice, <div class="bookquote">``you come an `ave a
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maurice</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried, shrinking back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! baby. The mardy-kid!''  (<font color='red'><b>brothers</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brothers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't hurt a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``It only just nips rather nicely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) still cried, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) black curls and shrinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dursn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) niver durst do anything except recite
poitry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Dursn't jump off a gate, dursn't tweedle, dursn't go on a slide,
dursn't stop a girl hittin' her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can do nowt but go about thinkin'
herself somebody. ``The Lady of the Lake.<div class="bookquote">'' Yah!''  (<font color='red'><b>The Lady</b></font>)</div>cried Maurice.

<p/>Miriam was crimson with shame and misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare do more than you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You're never anything but cowards
and bullies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, cowards and bullies!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they repeated mincingly, mocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not such a clown shall anger me,
A boor is answered silently,''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) quoted against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), shouting with laughter.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went indoors. Paul went with the boys into the orchard, where they
had rigged up a parallel bar. They did feats of strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was more
agile than strong, but it served. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingered a piece of apple-blossom
that hung low on a swinging bough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't get the apple-blossom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>said Edgar, the eldest brother.
<div class="bookquote">``There'll be no apples next year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't going to get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul, going away.

<p/>The boys felt hostile to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); they were more interested in their own
pursuits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wandered back to the house to look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
went round the back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw Miriam kneeling in front of the hen-coop,
some maize in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hand, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lip, and crouching in an intense
attitude. The hen was eyeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wickedly. Very gingerly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put forward
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hand. The hen bobbed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) drew back quickly with a cry, half
of fear, half of chagrin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't hurt you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) flushed crimson and started up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wanted to try,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, it doesn't hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, and, putting only two corns in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
palm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) let the hen peck, peck, peck at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bare hand. <div class="bookquote">``It only makes
you laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hand forward and dragged it away, tried again, and started
back with a cry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I'd let her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) take corn from my face,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``only she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bumps a
bit. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s ever so neat. If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wasn't, look how much ground she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d peck
up every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited grimly, and watched. At last Miriam let the bird peck from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) gave a little cry--fear, and pain because of fear--rather
pathetic. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had done it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't hurt, does it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with dilated dark eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed, trembling.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rose and went indoors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed to be in some way resentful
of the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks I'm only a common girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted to prove
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was a grand person like the <div class="bookquote">``Lady of the Lake'' (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>Paul found his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother ready to go home. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took
the great bunch of flowers. Mr. and Mrs. Leivers walked down the fields
with them. The hills were golden with evening; deep in the woods showed
the darkening purple of bluebells. It was everywhere perfectly stiff,
save for the rustling of leaves and birds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a beautiful place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leivers</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Leivers; <div class="bookquote">``it's a nice little place, if only it
weren't for the rabbits. The pasture's bitten down to nothing. I dunno
if ever I s'll get the rent off it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leivers</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) hands, and the field broke into motion near the woods,
brown rabbits hopping everywhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Morel.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) and Paul went on alone together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't it lovely, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/>A thin moon was coming out. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart was full of happiness till it
hurt. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother had to chatter, because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), too, wanted to cry with
happiness.

<p/>``Now WOULDN``T I help that man!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. ``WOULDN'T I see to the fowls
and the young stock! And I``D learn to milk, and I``D talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
I``D plan with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). My word, if I were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, the farm would be run,
I know! But there, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hasn't the strength--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) simply hasn't the
strength. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ought never to have been burdened like it, you know. I'm
sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and I'm sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too. My word, if I<div class="bookquote">``D had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I
shouldn't have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a bad husband! Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does either; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s very lovable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>William came home again with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sweetheart at the Whitsuntide. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had
one week of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) holidays then. It was beautiful weather. As a rule,
William and Lily and Paul went out in the morning together for a walk.
William did not talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) beloved much, except to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) things from
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boyhood. Paul talked endlessly to both of them. They lay down, all
three, in a meadow by Minton Church. On one side, by the Castle Farm,
was a beautiful quivering screen of poplars. Hawthorn was dropping
from the hedges; penny daisies and ragged robin were in the field, like
laughter. William, a big fellow of twenty-three, thinner now and even a
bit gaunt, lay back in the sunshine and dreamed, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) fingered with
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hair. Paul went gathering the big daisies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
hat; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) hair was black as a horse's mane. Paul came back and threaded
daisies in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) jet-black hair--big spangles of white and yellow, and
just a pink touch of ragged robin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you look like a young witch-woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), William?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Louisa Lily Denys Western</b></font>)</div><p/>Lily laughed. William opened his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) eyes and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). In his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) gaze was
a certain baffled look of misery and fierce appreciation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) made a sight of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) asked, laughing down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has!''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William, smiling.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) beauty seemed to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
flower-decked head and frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look nice enough, if that's what you want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) walked without her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) hat. In a little while William recovered, and
was rather tender to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). Coming to a bridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) carved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) initials and
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in a heart.

<p/>L. L. W.

<p/>W. M.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) strong, nervous hand, with its glistening hairs and
freckles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) carved, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) seemed fascinated by it.

<p/>All the time there was a feeling of sadness and warmth, and a certain
tenderness in the house, whilst William and Lily were at home. But often
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) got irritable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had brought, for an eight-days' stay, five dresses
and six blouses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, would you mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) said to Annie, <div class="bookquote">``washing me these two blouses,
and these things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>And Annie stood washing when William and Lily went out the next morning.
Mrs. Morel was furious. And sometimes the young man, catching a glimpse
of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sweetheart's attitude towards his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister, hated her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).

<p/>On Sunday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) looked very beautiful in a dress of foulard, silky
and sweeping, and blue as a jay-bird's feather, and in a large cream hat
covered with many roses, mostly crimson. Nobody could admire her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) enough.
But in the evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was going out, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) asked again:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chubby, have you got my gloves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which?''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>asked William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My new black SUEDE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a hunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had lost them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William, <div class="bookquote">``that's the fourth pair she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s lost
since Christmas--at five shillings a pair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You only gave me TWO of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) remonstrated.

<p/>And in the evening, after supper, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stood on the hearthrug whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
sat on the sofa, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed to hate her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). In the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went to see some old friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had sat looking at a
book. After supper William wanted to write a letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is your book, Lily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Would you care to go on
with it for a few minutes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. <div class="bookquote">``I will sit still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is so dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>William scribbled irritably at a great rate. As he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sealed the envelope
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read a book! Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)'s never read a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, go along!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, cross with the exaggeration,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's true, mother--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cried, jumping up and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) old
position on the hearthrug. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s never read a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Er's like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morel</b></font>)</div>chimed in Morel. <div class="bookquote">''`Er canna see what there is i' books,
ter sit borin' your nose in 'em for, nor more can I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you shouldn't say these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son.

<p/>``But it's true, mother--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) CAN<div class="bookquote">``T read. What did you give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a little thing of Annie Swan's. Nobody wants to read
dry stuff on Sunday afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll bet she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) didn't read ten lines of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother.

<p/>All the time Lily sat miserably on the sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) swiftly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DID you read any?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how many pages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me ONE THING you read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) could not.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) never got beyond the second page. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) read a great deal, and had a
quick, active intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) could understand nothing but love-making
and chatter. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was accustomed to having all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) thoughts sifted through
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother's mind; so, when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wanted companionship, and was asked in
reply to be the billing and twittering lover, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hated his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) betrothed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at night, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s
no idea of money, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s so wessel-brained. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s paid, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll
suddenly buy such rot as marrons glaces, and then I have to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
season ticket, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) extras, even her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) underclothing. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants to
get married, and I think myself we might as well get married next year.
But at this rate--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fine mess of a marriage it would be,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I should
consider it again, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, I've gone too far to break off now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and so I shall
get married as soon as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my boy. If you will, you will, and there's no stopping you;
but I tell you, I can't sleep when I think about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll be all right, mother. We shall manage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lets you buy her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) underclothing?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) began apologetically, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't ask me; but one
morning--and it WAS cold--I found her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on the station shivering, not able
to keep still; so I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was well wrapped up. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said: ``I
think so.'' So I said: ``Have you got warm underthings on?'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
said: ``No, they were cotton.<div class="bookquote">'' I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) why on earth she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hadn't got
something thicker on in weather like that, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) HAD
nothing. And there she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is--a bronchial subject! I HAD to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and
get some warm things. Well, mother, I shouldn't mind the money if we
had any. And, you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) OUGHT to keep enough to pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
season-ticket; but no, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) comes to me about that, and I have to find
the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a poor lookout,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel bitterly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was pale, and his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rugged face, that used to be so perfectly careless
and laughing, was stamped with conflict and despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up now; it's gone too far,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And,
besides, for SOME things I couldn't do without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My boy, remember you're taking your life in your hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Morel. <div class="bookquote">``NOTHING is as bad as a marriage that's a hopeless failure. Mine
was bad enough, God knows, and ought to teach you something; but it
might have been worse by a long chalk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) leaned with his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back against the side of the chimney-piece, his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands
in his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a big, raw-boned man, who looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
go to the world's end if he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw the despair on his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``remember there are worse wrongs than breaking off an
engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up NOW,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>The clock ticked on; mother and son remained in silence, a conflict
between them; but he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would say no more. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, go to bed, my son. You'll feel better in the morning, and perhaps
you'll know better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and went. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) raked the fire. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart was heavy now
as it had never been. Before, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, things had seemed to be
breaking down in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but they did not destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) power to live. Now
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul felt lamed in itself. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hope that was struck.

<p/>And so often William manifested the same hatred towards his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) betrothed.
On the last evening at home he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was railing against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you don't believe me, what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s like, would you
believe she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been confirmed three times?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>laughed Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) HAS! That's what confirmation means for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--a bit
of a theatrical show where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can cut a figure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't, Mrs. Morel!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl--<div class="bookquote">``I haven't! it is not true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cried, flashing round on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Once in Bromley, once in
Beckenham, and once somewhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nowhere else!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, in tears--<div class="bookquote">``nowhere else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It WAS! And if it wasn't why were you confirmed TWICE?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once I was only fourteen, Mrs. Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pleaded, tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel; <div class="bookquote">``I can quite understand it, child. Take no
notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>). You ought to be ashamed, William, saying such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's true. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s religious--she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had blue velvet Prayer-Books--and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s not as much religion, or anything else, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) than that
table-leg. Gets confirmed three times for show, to show herself off, and
that's how she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) is in EVERYTHING--EVERYTHING!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl sat on the sofa, crying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was not strong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for LOVE!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you might as well ask a fly to love you! It'll
love settling on you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, say no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>commanded Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to say these
things, you must find another place than this. I am ashamed of you,
William! Why don't you be more manly. To do nothing but find fault with
a girl, and then pretend you're engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel subsided in wrath and indignation.

<p/>William was silent, and later he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) repented, kissed and comforted the
girl. Yet it was true, what he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had said. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>When they were going away, Mrs. Morel accompanied them as far as
Nottingham. It was a long way to Keston station.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Gyp's shallow. Nothing goes deep
with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``William, I WISH you wouldn't say these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, very
uncomfortable for the girl who walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it doesn't, mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s very much in love with me now, but if I
died she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d have forgotten me in three months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel was afraid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart beat furiously, hearing the quiet
bitterness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son's last speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied. ``You DON<div class="bookquote">``T know, and therefore you've no
right to say such a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s always saying these things!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In three months after I was buried you'd have somebody else, and I
should be forgotten,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And that's your love!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel saw them into the train in Nottingham, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) returned
home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to Paul--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'ll never have any money to
marry on, that I AM sure of. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll save him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took cheer. Matters were not yet very desperate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) firmly
believed William would never marry his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) Gipsy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) waited, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) kept
Paul near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>All summer long William's letters had a feverish tone; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed
unnatural and intense. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was exaggeratedly jolly, usually he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
was flat and bitter in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s ruining himself against that
creature, who isn't worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) love--no, no more than a rag doll.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wanted to come home. The midsummer holiday was gone; it was a long
while to Christmas. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wrote in wild excitement, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could come
for Saturday and Sunday at Goose Fair, the first week in October.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not well, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
almost in tears at having him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to herself again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've not been well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I've seemed to have a dragging cold
all the last month, but it's going, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was sunny October weather. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seemed wild with joy, like a schoolboy
escaped; then again he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) was silent and reserved. He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) was more gaunt than
ever, and there was a haggard look in his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are doing too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) mother to him (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) was doing extra work, trying to make some money to marry on, he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) only talked to his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) mother once on the Saturday night; then he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) was sad
and tender about his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) beloved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet, you know, mother, for all that, if I died she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d be
broken-hearted for two months, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d start to forget me. You'd
see, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d never come home here to look at my grave, not even once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, William,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``you're not going to die, so why talk
about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But whether or not--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can't help it. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is like that, and if you choose her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--well,
you can't grumble,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) mother.

<p/>On the Sunday morning, as he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) was putting his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) collar on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) mother, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) chin, <div class="bookquote">``what a rash my
collar's made under my chin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Just at the junction of chin and throat was a big red inflammation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought not to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Here, put a bit of this
soothing ointment on. You should wear different collars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) went away on Sunday midnight, seeming better and more solid for his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>)
two days at home.

<p/>On Tuesday morning came a telegram from London that he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) was ill. Mrs.
Morel got off her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knees from washing the floor, read the telegram,
called a neighbour, went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) landlady and borrowed a sovereign, put
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) things, and set off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hurried to Keston, caught an express for
London in Nottingham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had to wait in Nottingham nearly an hour. A
small figure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) black bonnet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was anxiously asking the porters
if they knew how to get to Elmers End. The journey was three hours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) corner in a kind of stupor, never moving. At King's Cross
still no one could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) how to get to Elmers End. Carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
string bag, that contained her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) nightdress, a comb and brush, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went
from person to person. At last they sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) underground to Cannon
Street.

<p/>It was six o'clock when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) arrived at William's lodging. The blinds
were not down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) followed the woman upstairs. William lay on the bed, with bloodshot
eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face rather discoloured. The clothes were tossed about, there
was no fire in the room, a glass of milk stood on the stand at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
bedside. No one had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my son!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother bravely.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) began
to say, in a dull voice, as if repeating a letter from dictation: <div class="bookquote">``Owing
to a leakage in the hold of this vessel, the sugar had set, and become
converted into rock. It needed hacking--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was quite unconscious. It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) business to examine some such
cargo of sugar in the Port of London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long has he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) been like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the mother asked the landlady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) got home at six o'clock on Monday morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seemed to sleep
all day; then in the night we heard him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) talking, and this morning he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
asked for you. So I wired, and we fetched the doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you have a fire made?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel tried to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) still.

<p/>The doctor came. It was pneumonia, and, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, a peculiar erysipelas,
which had started under the chin where the collar chafed, and was
spreading over the face. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hoped it would not get to the brain.

<p/>Mrs. Morel settled down to nurse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) prayed for William, prayed that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
would recognise her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). But the young man's face grew more discoloured.
In the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) struggled with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) raved, and raved, and would not
come to consciousness. At two o'clock, in a dreadful paroxysm, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) died.

<p/>Mrs. Morel sat perfectly still for an hour in the lodging bedroom; then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) roused the household.

<p/>At six o'clock, with the aid of the charwoman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) out; then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went round the dreary London village to the registrar and the
doctor.

<p/>At nine o'clock to the cottage on Scargill Street came another wire:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``William died last night. Let father come, bring money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Scargill Street</b></font>)</div><p/>Annie, Paul, and Arthur were at home; Mr. Morel was gone to work. The
three children said not a word. Annie began to whimper with fear; Paul
set off for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father.

<p/>It was a beautiful day. At Brinsley pit the white steam melted slowly in
the sunshine of a soft blue sky; the wheels of the headstocks twinkled
high up; the screen, shuffling its coal into the trucks, made a busy
noise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want my father; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got to go to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy to the first
man he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) met on the bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha wants Walter Morel? Go in theer an' tell Joe Ward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul went into the little top office.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want my father; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got to go to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thy feyther? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) down? What's his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Morel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Walter? Is owt amiss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)'s got to go to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man went to the telephone and rang up the bottom office.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter Morel's wanted, number 42, Hard. Summat's amiss; there's his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lad
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned round to Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'ll be up in a few minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Paul wandered out to the pit-top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched the chair come up, with its
wagon of coal. The great iron cage sank back on its rest, a full carfle
was hauled off, an empty tram run on to the chair, a bell ting`ed
somewhere, the chair heaved, then dropped like a stone.

<p/>Paul did not realise William was dead; it was impossible, with such
a bustle going on. The puller-off swung the small truck on to the
turn-table, another man ran with it along the bank down the curving
lines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And William is dead, and my mother's in London, and what will she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) be
doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy asked himself, as if it were a conundrum.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) watched chair after chair come up, and still no father. At last,
standing beside a wagon, a man's form! the chair sank on its rests,
Morel stepped off. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was slightly lame from an accident.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it thee, Paul? Is 'e worse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to go to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>The two walked off the pit-bank, where men were watching curiously. As
they came out and went along the railway, with the sunny autumn field on
one side and a wall of trucks on the other, Morel said in a frightened
voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`E's niver gone, child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When wor`t?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Last night. We had a telegram from my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel walked on a few strides, then leaned up against a truck-side,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not crying. Paul stood looking round,
waiting. On the weighing machine a truck trundled slowly. Paul saw
everything, except his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father leaning against the truck as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were
tired.

<p/>Morel had only once before been to London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) set off, scared and
peaked, to help his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife. That was on Tuesday. The children were left
alone in the house. Paul went to work, Arthur went to school, and Annie
had in a friend to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).

<p/>On Saturday night, as Paul was turning the corner, coming home from
Keston, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother and father, who had come to Sethley Bridge
Station. They were walking in silence in the dark, tired, straggling
apart. The boy waited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, in the darkness.

<p/>Mrs. Morel's small figure seemed not to observe. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, uninterestedly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) seemed unaware of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>In the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was the same--small, white, and mute. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) noticed
nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said nothing, only:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The coffin will be here to-night, Walter. You'd better see about some
help.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then, turning to the children: <div class="bookquote">``We're bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) relapsed into the same mute looking into space, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hands
folded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lap. Paul, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not breathe. The
house was dead silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went to work, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said plaintively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) answered, dully.

<p/>After half an hour Morel, troubled and bewildered, came in again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wheer s'll we ha'e him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) DOES come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the front-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'd better shift th' table?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' ha'e him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) across th' chairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know there--Yes, I suppose so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel and Paul went, with a candle, into the parlour. There was no gas
there. The father unscrewed the top of the big mahogany oval table, and
cleared the middle of the room; then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arranged six chairs opposite
each other, so that the coffin could stand on their beds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You niver seed such a length as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>said the miner, and watching
anxiously as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) worked.

<p/>Paul went to the bay window and looked out. The ash-tree stood monstrous
and black in front of the wide darkness. It was a faintly luminous
night. Paul went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/>At ten o'clock Morel called:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)'s here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone started. There was a noise of unbarring and unlocking the front
door, which opened straight from the night into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring another candle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>called Morel.

<p/>Annie and Arthur went. Paul followed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) waist in the inner doorway. Down the middle of the cleared
room waited six chairs, face to face. In the window, against the lace
curtains, Arthur held up one candle, and by the open door, against the
night, Annie stood leaning forward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) brass candlestick glittering.

<p/>There was the noise of wheels. Outside in the darkness of the street
below Paul could see horses and a black vehicle, one lamp, and a few
pale faces; then some men, miners, all in their shirt-sleeves, seemed to
struggle in the obscurity. Presently two men appeared, bowed beneath a
great weight. It was Morel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) neighbour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Steady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>called Morel, out of breath.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fellow mounted the steep garden step, heaved into the
candlelight with their gleaming coffin-end. Limbs of other men were seen
struggling behind. Morel and Burns, in front, staggered; the great dark
weight swayed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Steady, steady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Morel, as if in pain.

<p/>All the six bearers were up in the small garden, holding the great
coffin aloft. There were three more steps to the door. The yellow lamp
of the carriage shone alone down the black road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/>The coffin swayed, the men began to mount the three steps with their
load. Annie's candle flickered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) whimpered as the first men
appeared, and the limbs and bowed heads of six men struggled to climb
into the room, bearing the coffin that rode like sorrow on their living
flesh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my son--my son!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel sang softly, and each time the coffin
swung to the unequal climbing of the men: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my son--my son--my son!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul whimpered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand round her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) waist.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my son--my son!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>Paul saw drops of sweat fall from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father's brow. Six men were in
the room--six coatless men, with yielding, struggling limbs, filling
the room and knocking against the furniture. The coffin veered, and was
gently lowered on to the chairs. The sweat fell from Morel's face on its
boards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s a weight!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man miners</b></font>)</div>said a man, and the five miners sighed, bowed,
and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again, closing the
door behind them.

<p/>The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never be
got out of the room again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother was stroking the polished wood.

<p/>They buried him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) on the Monday in the little cemetery on the hillside
that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses. It was
sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves in the warmth.

<p/>Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) old
bright interest in life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) remained shut off. All the way home in the
train she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had said to herself: <div class="bookquote">``If only it could have been me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When Paul came home at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother sitting, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) day's work
done, with hands folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lap upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coarse apron. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always
used to have changed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dress and put on a black apron, before. Now
Annie set his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) supper, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother sat looking blankly in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth shut tight. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brains for news to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said my sketch of a
colliery at work was beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) forced himself to
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) things, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not listen. It drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) almost insane
to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thus. At last:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a-matter, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a-matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) persisted. <div class="bookquote">``Mother, what's a-matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what's the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said irritably, turning away.

<p/>The lad--he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was cut off
and wretched through October, November and December. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother tried,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not rouse herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could only brood on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dead son;
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been let to die so cruelly.

<p/>At last, on December 23, with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) five shillings Christmas-box in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
heart stood still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm badly, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jordan gave me five shillings for
a Christmas-box!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) handed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with trembling hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put it on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You aren't glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) trembled violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where hurts you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, unbuttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) overcoat.

<p/>It was the old question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel badly, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) undressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had pneumonia dangerously, the
doctor said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) never have had it if I'd kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) at home, not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) go to
Nottingham?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was one of the first things she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) might not have been so bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/>Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have watched the living, not the dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) told herself.

<p/>Paul was very ill. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother lay in bed at nights with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); they could
not afford a nurse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) grew worse, and the crisis approached. One
night he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling of
dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense irritability
to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last flare of struggle,
like madness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll die, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) up, crying in a small voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my son--my son!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>That brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) realised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whole will rose up and
arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast, and took ease of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for
love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For some things,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt thing</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) aunt, <div class="bookquote">``it was a good thing Paul was ill that
Christmas. I believe it saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt thing</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got up white and fragile. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father
had bought him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a pot of scarlet and gold tulips. They used to flame in
the window in the March sunshine as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat on the sofa chattering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mother. The two knitted together in perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life
now rooted itself in Paul.

<p/>William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present and a letter
from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had a letter at the New
Year.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there, and I
enjoyed myself thoroughly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the letter. <div class="bookquote">``I had every dance--did not
sit out one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>Morel and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wife were gentle with each other for some time after the
death of their son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would go into a kind of daze, staring wide-eyed
and blank across the room. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) got up suddenly and hurried out to
the Three Spots, returning in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) normal state. But never in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life
would he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) go for a walk up Shepstone, past the office where his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son had
worked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) always avoided the cemetery.



<p/>PART TWO

<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>LAD-AND-GIRL LOVE

<p/>PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>)
was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was
afraid of being set at nought, as by her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) own brothers. The girl was
romantic in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott heroine being
loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) herself was
something of a princess turned into a swine-girl in her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) own imagination.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was afraid lest this boy, who, nevertheless, looked something
like a Walter Scott hero, who could paint and speak French, and knew
what algebra meant, and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might
consider her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess
beneath; so she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) held aloof.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) great companion was her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) mother. They were both brown-eyed, and
inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion inside them,
breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life in a mist
thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset burned
out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de Bois
Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves in the
morning, or sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed. That was
life to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). For the rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) drudged in the house, which work she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
would not have minded had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) clean red floor been mucked up
immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brothers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) madly
wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) little brother of four to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) swathe him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and stifle
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) love; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went to church reverently, with bowed head, and
quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the other choir-girls and from
the common-sounding voice of the curate; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brothers,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) considered brutal louts; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) held not her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) father in too
high esteem because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not carry any mystical ideals cherished in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart, but only wanted to have as easy a time as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
meals when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was ready for them.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) position as swine-girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted to be considered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
wanted to learn, thinking that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could read, as Paul said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could
read, <div class="bookquote">``Colomba'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, or the <div class="bookquote">``Voyage autour de ma Chambre'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, the world would
have a different face for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and a deepened respect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not be
princess by wealth or standing. So she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was mad to have learning whereon
to pride herself. For she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was different from other folk, and must not
be scooped up among the common fry. Learning was the only distinction to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) thought to aspire.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive thing--seemed
nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>). Even her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) soul, so strong for rhapsody, was not enough.
She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) must have something to reinforce her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) pride, because she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt
different from other people. Paul she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) eyed rather wistfully. On the
whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) scorned the male sex. But here was a new specimen, quick,
light, graceful, who could be gentle and who could be sad, and who was
clever, and who knew a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's
poor morsel of learning exalted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost sky-high in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) esteem.
Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tried hard to scorn him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would not see in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) the
princess but only the swine-girl. And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) scarcely observed her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would be weak. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) would be
stronger than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could love him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could be mistress of
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) weakness, take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
could, as it were, have him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) arms, how she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) would love him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!

<p/>As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out, Paul drove off
in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm. Mr. Leivers shouted in a
kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked to the horse as they climbed the
hill slowly, in the freshness of the morning. White clouds went on
their way, crowding to the back of the hills that were rousing in the
springtime. The water of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the
seared meadows and the thorn-trees.

<p/>It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges, vivid
as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called, and
blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

<p/>Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk through
the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the oak-wood,
still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking, ruddy farmer
handed down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>Miriam appeared in the doorway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was nearly sixteen, very beautiful,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) warm colouring, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) gravity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes dilating suddenly like an
ecstasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, turning shyly aside, <div class="bookquote">``your daffodils are nearly out.
Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cold!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) musical, caressing voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The green on their buds--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) faltered into silence timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me take the rug,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam over-gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can carry it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered, rather injured. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) yielded it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you're tired and cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let me take your coat. It
IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was quite unused to such attention.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) was almost smothered under its weight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>laughed the farmer as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, <div class="bookquote">``you've got almost more than you can
manage there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

<p/>The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been originally
a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered. But Paul
loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug, and the funny
little corner under the stairs, and the small window deep in the corner,
through which, bending a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could see the plum trees in the back
garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you lie down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Leivers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; I'm not tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it lovely coming out, don't you
think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines. I'm glad
it's sunny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's your mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s tired now. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s had too much to do. Perhaps in a
little while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll go to Skegness with me. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll be able to rest.
I s'll be glad if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Leivers. <div class="bookquote">``It's a wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) isn't ill herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched everything that
happened. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face was pale and thin, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes were quick and bright
with life as ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched the strange, almost rhapsodic way in which
the girl moved about, carrying a great stew-jar to the oven, or looking
in the saucepan. The atmosphere was different from that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own home,
where everything seemed so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly
outside to the horse, that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes
in the garden, the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if
something had come breaking in on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) world. There was a sense of
silence inside the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale,
a maiden in bondage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) discoloured, old blue frock and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) broken boots seemed only
like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) suddenly became aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) keen blue eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) all
in. Instantly her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) broken boots and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) frayed old frock hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
resented his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) seeing everything. Even he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stocking was not
pulled up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went into the scullery, blushing deeply. And afterwards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands trembled slightly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) nearly dropped all she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
handled. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) inside dream was shaken, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) body quivered with
trepidation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) resented that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) saw so much.

<p/>Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) was
needed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) was too polite to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)
excused herself and rose. After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) looked into the tin
saucepan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh DEAR, Miriam,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``these potatoes have boiled dry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam started as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had been stung.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HAVE they, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't care, Miriam,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, <div class="bookquote">``if I hadn't trusted them
to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) peered into the pan.

<p/>The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark eyes dilated; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
remained standing in the same spot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, gripped tight in self-conscious shame, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I
looked at them five minutes since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, <div class="bookquote">``I know it's easily done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're not much burned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter, does it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Leivers looked at the youth with her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) brown, hurt eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't matter but for the boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Only Miriam
knows what a trouble they make if the potatoes are `caught'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>thought Paul to himself, <div class="bookquote">``you shouldn't let them make a
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>After a while Edgar came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) wore leggings, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) boots were
covered with earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was rather small, rather formal, for a farmer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
glanced at Paul, nodded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) distantly, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dinner ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly, Edgar,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>replied the mother apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm ready for mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, taking up the newspaper and
reading. Presently the rest of the family trooped in. Dinner was served.
The meal went rather brutally. The over-gentleness and apologetic tone
of the mother brought out all the brutality of manners in the sons.
Edgar tasted the potatoes, moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) mouth quickly like a rabbit, looked
indignantly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) mother, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These potatoes are burnt, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Edgar. I forgot them for a minute. Perhaps you'll have bread if
you can't eat them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div><p/>Edgar looked in anger across at Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was Miriam doing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) couldn't attend to them?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said.

<p/>Miriam looked up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth opened, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark eyes blazed and winced, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) swallowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) anger and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shame, bowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was trying hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hasn't got sense even to boil the potatoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>said Edgar. <div class="bookquote">``What is
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) kept at home for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On'y for eating everything that's left in th' pantry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maurice</b></font>)</div>said Maurice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't forget that potato-pie against our Miriam,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>laughed the
father.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was utterly humiliated. The mother sat in silence, suffering, like
some saint out of place at the brutal board.

<p/>It puzzled Paul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wondered vaguely why all this intense feeling
went running because of a few burnt potatoes. The mother exalted
everything--even a bit of housework--to the plane of a religious trust.
The sons resented this; they felt themselves cut away underneath, and
they answered with brutality and also with a sneering superciliousness.

<p/>Paul was just opening out from childhood into manhood. This atmosphere,
where everything took a religious value, came with a subtle fascination
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). There was something in the air. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own mother was logical. Here
there was something different, something he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved, something that at
times he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated.

<p/>Miriam quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brothers fiercely. Later in the afternoon,
when they had gone away again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mother said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You disappointed me at dinner-time, Miriam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are such BRUTES!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suddenly cried, looking up with flashing
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But hadn't you promised not to answer them?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother. ``And I
believed in you. I CAN<div class="bookquote">``T stand it when you wrangle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they're so hateful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>cried Miriam, <div class="bookquote">``and--and LOW.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear. But how often have I asked you not to answer Edgar back?
Can't you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) likes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) likes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you strong enough to bear it, Miriam, if even for my sake? Are
you so weak that you must wrangle with them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Leivers stuck unflinchingly to this doctrine of <div class="bookquote">``the other cheek'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) could not instil it at all into the boys. With the girls she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)
succeeded better, and Miriam was the child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart. The boys
loathed the other cheek when it was presented to them. Miriam was often
sufficiently lofty to turn it. Then they spat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) walked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) proud humility, living within herself.

<p/>There was always this feeling of jangle and discord in the Leivers
family. Although the boys resented so bitterly this eternal appeal to
their deeper feelings of resignation and proud humility, yet it had
its effect on them. They could not establish between themselves and an
outsider just the ordinary human feeling and unexaggerated friendship;
they were always restless for the something deeper. Ordinary folk
seemed shallow to them, trivial and inconsiderable. And so they were
unaccustomed, painfully uncouth in the simplest social intercourse,
suffering, and yet insolent in their superiority. Then beneath was the
yearning for the soul-intimacy to which they could not attain because
they were too dumb, and every approach to close connection was blocked
by their clumsy contempt of other people. They wanted genuine intimacy,
but they could not get even normally near to anyone, because they
scorned to take the first steps, they scorned the triviality which forms
common human intercourse.

<p/>Paul fell under Mrs. Leivers's spell. Everything had a religious
and intensified meaning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul, hurt, highly
developed, sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) as if for nourishment. Together they seemed to
sift the vital fact from an experience.

<p/>Miriam was her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mother's daughter. In the sunshine of the afternoon
mother and daughter went down the fields with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). They looked for
nests. There was a jenny wren's in the hedge by the orchard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I DO want you to see this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Leivers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) crouched down and carefully put his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) finger through the thorns into
the round door of the nest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's almost as if you were feeling inside the live body of the bird,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's so warm. They say a bird makes its nest round like a cup
with pressing its breast on it. Then how did it make the ceiling round,
I wonder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The nest seemed to start into life for the two women. After that, Miriam
came to see it every day. It seemed so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Again, going
down the hedgeside with the girl, he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) noticed the celandines, scalloped
splashes of gold, on the side of the ditch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when their petals go flat back with the
sunshine. They seemed to be pressing themselves at the sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then the celandines ever after drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a little spell.
Anthropomorphic as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stimulated him (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) into appreciating things
thus, and then they lived for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to need things kindling in
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) imagination or in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soul before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had them. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was cut off from ordinary life by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) religious intensity which made
the world for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) either a nunnery garden or a paradise, where sin and
knowledge were not, or else an ugly, cruel thing.

<p/>So it was in this atmosphere of subtle intimacy, this meeting in their
common feeling for something in Nature, that their love started.

<p/>Personally, he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) was a long time before he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) realized her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). For ten months he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>)
had to stay at home after his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) illness. For a while he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) went to Skegness
with his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) mother, and was perfectly happy. But even from the seaside he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>)
wrote long letters to Mrs. Leivers about the shore and the sea. And he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>)
brought back his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) beloved sketches of the flat Lincoln coast, anxious
for them to see. Almost they would interest the Leivers more than they
interested his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) mother. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) art Mrs. Morel cared about; it
was himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) achievement. But Mrs. Leivers and her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) children were
almost his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) disciples. They kindled him (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) and made him (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) glow to his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) work,
whereas his (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) mother's influence was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) quietly determined,
patient, dogged, unwearied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) soon was friends with the boys, whose rudeness was only superficial.
They had all, when they could trust themselves, a strange gentleness and
lovableness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come with me on to the fallow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>asked Edgar, rather
hesitatingly.

<p/>Paul went joyfully, and spent the afternoon helping to hoe or to single
turnips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) used to lie with the three brothers in
the hay piled up in the barn and tell them about Nottingham and about
Jordan's. In return, they taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to milk, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) do little
jobs--chopping hay or pulping turnips--just as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked. At
midsummer he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) worked all through hay-harvest with them, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved
them. The family was so cut off from the world actually. They seemed,
somehow, like <div class="bookquote">''_les derniers fils d'une race epuisee_'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>. Though the lads
were strong and healthy, yet they had all that over-sensitiveness and
hanging-back which made them so lonely, yet also such close, delicate
friends once their intimacy was won. Paul loved them dearly, and they
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>Miriam came later. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) life before she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) made any
mark on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). One dull afternoon, when the men were on the land and the
rest at school, only Miriam and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mother at home, the girl said to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), after having hesitated for some time:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen the swing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the cowshed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) always hesitated to offer or to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) anything. Men have such
different standards of worth from women, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dear things--the
valuable things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brothers had so often mocked or flouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied, jumping up.

<p/>There were two cowsheds, one on either side of the barn. In the lower,
darker shed there was standing for four cows. Hens flew scolding over
the manger-wall as the youth and girl went forward for the great thick
rope which hung from the beam in the darkness overhead, and was pushed
back over a peg in the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's something like a rope!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed appreciatively; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat
down on it, anxious to try it. Then immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, then, and have first go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, going into the barn, <div class="bookquote">``we put some bags on the
seat'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made the swing comfortable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). That gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held the rope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't go first,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood aside in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still, aloof fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/>Almost for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had the pleasure of giving up
to a man, of spoiling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Paul looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, sitting down. <div class="bookquote">``Mind out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) set off with a spring, and in a moment was flying through the air,
almost out of the door of the shed, the upper half of which was open,
showing outside the drizzling rain, the filthy yard, the cattle standing
disconsolate against the black cartshed, and at the back of all
the grey-green wall of the wood. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood below in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crimson
tam-o'-shanter and watched. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blue
eyes sparkling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a treat of a swing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was swinging through the air, every bit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) swinging, like a bird
that swoops for joy of movement. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crimson
cap hung over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark curls, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beautiful warm face, so still in a
kind of brooding, was lifted towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). It was dark and rather cold in
the shed. Suddenly a swallow came down from the high roof and darted out
of the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know a bird was watching,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) called.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) swung negligently. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) falling and lifting through the
air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were lying on some force.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I'll die,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, in a detached, dreamy voice, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were
the dying motion of the swing. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), fascinated. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
put on the brake and jumped out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had a long turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But it's a treat of a swing--it's a
real treat of a swing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam was amused that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took a swing so seriously and felt so warmly
over it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, don't you want one?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked, astonished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not much. I'll have just a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sat down, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kept the bags in place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so ripping!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in motion. <div class="bookquote">``Keep your heels up,
or they'll bang the manger wall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt the accuracy with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), exactly at the right
moment, and the exactly proportionate strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thrust, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
was afraid. Down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bowels went the hot wave of fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
hands. Again, firm and inevitable came the thrust at the right moment.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) gripped the rope, almost swooning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed in fear. <div class="bookquote">``No higher!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're not a BIT high,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) remonstrated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But no higher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard the fear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) voice, and desisted. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart melted in hot
pain when the moment came for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) forward again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) began to breathe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you really go any farther?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Should I keep you there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; let me go by myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) moved aside and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you're scarcely moving,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed slightly with shame, and in a moment got down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say if you can swing you won't be sea-sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mounted again. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe I should ever be sea-sick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Away he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went. There was something fascinating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). For the
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was nothing but a piece of swinging stuff; not a particle of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that did not swing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could never lose herself so, nor could her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
brothers. It roused a warmth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It was almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were a flame
that had lit a warmth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) swung in the middle air.

<p/>And gradually the intimacy with the family concentrated for Paul on
three persons--the mother, Edgar, and Miriam. To the mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) went for
that sympathy and that appeal which seemed to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) out. Edgar was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) very close friend. And to Miriam he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) more or less condescended,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed so humble.

<p/>But the girl gradually sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) out. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) brought up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) sketch-book,
it was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who pondered longest over the last picture. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
look up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). Suddenly, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark eyes alight like water that shakes
with a stream of gold in the dark, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would ask:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do I like this so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Always something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) breast shrank from these close, intimate,
dazzled looks of hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why DO you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. It seems so true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's because--it's because there is scarcely any shadow in it; it's
more shimmery, as if I'd painted the shimmering protoplasm in the leaves
and everywhere, and not the stiffness of the shape. That seems dead
to me. Only this shimmeriness is the real living. The shape is a dead
crust. The shimmer is inside really.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little finger in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth, would ponder these
sayings. They gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a feeling of life again, and vivified things
which had meant nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) managed to find some meaning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
struggling, abstract speeches. And they were the medium through which
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came distinctly at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beloved objects.

<p/>Another day she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat at sunset whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was painting some pine-trees
which caught the red glare from the west. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had been quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted that. Now, look at them and
tell me, are they pine trunks or are they red coals, standing-up pieces
of fire in that darkness? There's God's burning bush for you, that
burned not away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam looked, and was frightened. But the pine trunks were wonderful
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and distinct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) box and rose. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you always sad?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sad!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) exclaimed, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) with startled, wonderful brown
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``You are always sad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not--oh, not a bit!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But even your joy is like a flame coming off of sadness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) persisted.
<div class="bookquote">``You're never jolly, or even just all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pondered. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder--why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you're not; because you're different inside, like a pine-tree,
and then you flare up; but you're not just like an ordinary tree, with
fidgety leaves and jolly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) got tangled up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) own speech; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brooded on it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had a
strange, roused sensation, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) feelings were new. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) got so near
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). It was a strange stimulant.

<p/>Then sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) youngest brother was only five. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was
a frail lad, with immense brown eyes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) quaint fragile face--one of
Reynolds's <div class="bookquote">``Choir of Angels'' (<font color='red'><b>Reynolds</b></font>)</div>, with a touch of elf. Often Miriam kneeled
to the child and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, my Hubert!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sang, in a voice heavy and surcharged with love.
<div class="bookquote">``Eh, my Hubert!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And, folding him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) swayed slightly from side to side with
love, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face half lifted, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes half closed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) voice drenched
with love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child Miriam</b></font>)</div>said the child, uneasy--<div class="bookquote">``don't, Miriam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child Miriam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you love me, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) throat, almost
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) were in a trance, and swaying also as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) were swooned in
an ecstasy of love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>repeated the child, a frown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) clear brow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You love me, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you make such a FUSS for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>cried Paul, all in suffering because
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) extreme emotion. <div class="bookquote">``Why can't you be ordinary with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hubert</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) let the child go, and rose, and said nothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) intensity, which
would leave no emotion on a normal plane, irritated the youth into
a frenzy. And this fearful, naked contact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) on small occasions
shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was used to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's reserve. And on such occasions
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was thankful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart and soul that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, so sane
and wholesome.

<p/>All the life of Miriam's body was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes, which were usually dark
as a dark church, but could flame with light like a conflagration. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
face scarcely ever altered from its look of brooding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) might have
been one of the women who went with Mary when Jesus was dead. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) body
was not flexible and living. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked with a swing, rather heavily,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head bowed forward, pondering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not clumsy, and yet none of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) movements seemed quite THE movement. Often, when wiping the dishes,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would stand in bewilderment and chagrin because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had pulled
in two halves a cup or a tumbler. It was as if, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fear and
self-mistrust, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put too much strength into the effort. There was
no looseness or abandon about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Everything was gripped stiff with
intensity, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) effort, overcharged, closed in on itself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rarely varied from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) swinging, forward, intense walk. Occasionally
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran with Paul down the fields. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes blazed naked in a kind
of ecstasy that frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was physically afraid. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were getting over a stile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands in a little hard
anguish, and began to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) presence of mind. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to jump from even a small height. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes dilated, became
exposed and palpitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried, half laughing in terror--<div class="bookquote">``no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried once, and, jerking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
falling from the fence. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wild <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>of pain, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were
losing consciousness, cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) landed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet safely, and
afterwards had courage in this respect.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very much dissatisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like being at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered, low and intense. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? I'm all day
cleaning what the boys make just as bad in five minutes. I don't WANT to
be at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to do something. I want a chance like anybody else. Why should
I, because I'm a girl, be kept at home and not allowed to be anything?
What chance HAVE I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chance of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of knowing anything--of learning, of doing anything. It's not fair,
because I'm a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed very bitter. Paul wondered. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own home Annie was almost
glad to be a girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not so much responsibility; things were
lighter for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never wanted to be other than a girl. But Miriam
almost fiercely wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) were a man. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hated men at the same
time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's as well to be a woman as a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, frowning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! Is it? Men have everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think women ought to be as glad to be women as men are to be
men,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head--<div class="bookquote">``no! Everything the men have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to learn. Why SHOULD it be that I know nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! such as mathematics and French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why SHOULDN<div class="bookquote">``T I know mathematics? Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eye expanding in
a kind of defiance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can learn as much as I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll teach you, if
you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes dilated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mistrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as teacher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head had dropped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was sucking her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) finger broodingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said hesitatingly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother all these things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to teach Miriam algebra,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)'ll get fat on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went up to the farm on the Monday evening, it was drawing
twilight. Miriam was just sweeping up the kitchen, and was kneeling at
the hearth when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered. Everyone was out but her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked round
at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), flushed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark eyes shining, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fine hair falling about her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, soft and musical. <div class="bookquote">``I knew it was you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew your step. Nobody treads so quick and firm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down, sighing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready to do some algebra?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, drawing a little book from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) backing away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said you wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-night, though?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I came on purpose. And if you want to learn it, you must begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) ashes in the dustpan and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), half
tremulously, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but to-night! You see, I haven't thought of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my goodness! Take the ashes and come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went and sat on the stone bench in the back-yard, where the big
milk-cans were standing, tipped up, to air. The men were in the
cowsheds. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the little sing-song of the milk spurting into
the pails. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) came, bringing some big greenish apples.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you like them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took a bite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth full.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was short-sighted, and peered over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder. It irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) the book quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's only letters for figures. You put down `a'
instead of '2' or '6'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They worked, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head down on the book. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
quick and hasty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) never answered. Occasionally, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demanded
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Do you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes wide with the
half-laugh that comes of fear. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been too fast. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) more, then
got hot. It made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood rouse to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) there, as it were, at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mercy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth open, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes dilated with laughter that was afraid,
apologetic, ashamed. Then Edgar came along with two buckets of milk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Algebra,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Algebra!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>repeated Edgar curiously. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) passed on with a laugh.
Paul took a bite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) forgotten apple, looked at the miserable
cabbages in the garden, pecked into lace by the fowls, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to
pull them up. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) glanced at Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was poring over the book,
seemed absorbed in it, yet trembling lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not get at it. It
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cross. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was ruddy and beautiful. Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul seemed to be
intensely supplicating. The algebra-book she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) closed, shrinking, knowing
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was angered; and at the same instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) grew gentle, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hurt
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not understand.

<p/>But things came slowly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) held herself in a grip,
seemed so utterly humble before the lesson, it made his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood rouse.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stormed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), got ashamed, continued the lesson, and grew furious
again, abusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) listened in silence. Occasionally, very rarely,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) defended herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) liquid dark eyes blazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't give me time to learn it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered, throwing the book on the table and lighting
a cigarette. Then, after a while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) repentant. So the
lessons went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was always either in a rage or very gentle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you tremble your SOUL before it for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You don't
learn algebra with your blessed soul. Can't you look at it with your
clear simple wits?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Often, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went again into the kitchen, Mrs. Leivers would look at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) reproachfully, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul, don't be so hard on Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) may not be quick, but I'm sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) tries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said rather pitiably. <div class="bookquote">``I go off like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind me, Miriam, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked of the girl later.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beautiful deep tones--<div class="bookquote">``no, I don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me; it's my fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But, in spite of himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood began to boil with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). It was
strange that no one else made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in such fury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flared against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) threw the pencil in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. There was a silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face slightly aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began, but got no farther, feeling weak in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
bones. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) or was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was often
cruelly ashamed. But still again his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) anger burst like a bubble
surcharged; and still, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eager, silent, as it were, blind
face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to throw the pencil in it; and still, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand trembling and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth parted with suffering, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart
was scalded with pain for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). And because of the intensity to which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) often avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and went with Edgar. Miriam and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brother
were naturally antagonistic. Edgar was a rationalist, who was curious,
and had a sort of scientific interest in life. It was a great bitterness
to Miriam to see herself deserted by Paul for Edgar, who seemed so much
lower. But the youth was very happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) elder brother. The two men
spent afternoons together on the land or in the loft doing carpentry,
when it rained. And they talked together, or Paul taught Edgar the songs
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) himself had learned from Annie at the piano. And often all the men,
Mr. Leivers as well, had bitter debates on the nationalizing of the land
and similar problems. Paul had already heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's views, and as
these were as yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) argued for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Miriam attended and
took part, but was all the time waiting until it should be over and a
personal communication might begin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said within herself, <div class="bookquote">``if the land were nationalized,
Edgar and Paul and I would be just the same.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) waited for the
youth to come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was studying for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) painting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved to sit at home, alone with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, at night, working and working. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sewed or read. Then,
looking up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) task, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes for a moment on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
face, that was bright with living warmth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) returned gladly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can do my best things when you sit there in your rocking-chair,
mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed, sniffing with mock scepticism. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt
it was so, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart quivered with brightness. For many hours she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
sat still, slightly conscious of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) labouring away, whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worked
or read her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) book. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul's intensity directing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
pencil, could feel her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) warmth inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) like strength. They were both
very happy so, and both unconscious of it. These times, that meant so
much, and which were real living, they almost ignored.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was conscious only when stimulated. A sketch finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) always
wanted to take it to Miriam. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was stimulated into knowledge of
the work he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had produced unconsciously. In contact with Miriam he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
gained insight; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) vision went deeper. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) drew the
life-warmth, the strength to produce; Miriam urged this warmth into
intensity like a white light.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) returned to the factory the conditions of work were better.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had Wednesday afternoon off to go to the Art School--Miss Jordan's
provision--returning in the evening. Then the factory closed at six
instead of eight on Thursday and Friday evenings.

<p/>One evening in the summer Miriam and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went over the fields by Herod's
Farm on their way from the library home. So it was only three miles
to Willey Farm. There was a yellow glow over the mowing-grass, and the
sorrel-heads burned crimson. Gradually, as they walked along the high
land, the gold in the west sank down to red, the red to crimson, and
then the chill blue crept up against the glow.

<p/>They came out upon the high road to Alfreton, which ran white between
the darkening fields. There Paul hesitated. It was two miles home for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), one mile forward for Miriam. They both looked up the road that ran
in shadow right under the glow of the north-west sky. On the crest of
the hill, Selby, with its stark houses and the up-pricked headstocks of
the pit, stood in black silhouette small against the sky.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine o'clock!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) said.

<p/>The pair stood, loth to part, hugging their books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The wood is so lovely now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted you to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) slowly across the road to the white gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They grumble so if I'm late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're not doing anything wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered impatiently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) across the nibbled pasture in the dusk. There was a
coolness in the wood, a scent of leaves, of honeysuckle, and a twilight.
The two walked in silence. Night came wonderfully there, among the
throng of dark tree-trunks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) looked round, expectant.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) a certain wild-rose bush she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had discovered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
knew it was wonderful. And yet, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) had seen it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt it had
not come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul. Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) could make it her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) own, immortal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was
dissatisfied.

<p/>Dew was already on the paths. In the old oak-wood a mist was rising, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) hesitated, wondering whether one whiteness were a strand of fog or
only campion-flowers pallid in a cloud.

<p/>By the time they came to the pine-trees Miriam was getting very eager
and very tense. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bush might be gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) might not be able to find
it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted it so much. Almost passionately she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted to be
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) stood before the flowers. They were going to have a
communion together--something that thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), something holy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) was
walking beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in silence. They were very near to each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
trembled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) listened, vaguely anxious.

<p/>Coming to the edge of the wood, they saw the sky in front, like
mother-of-pearl, and the earth growing dark. Somewhere on the outermost
branches of the pine-wood the honeysuckle was streaming scent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Down the middle path,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured, quivering.

<p/>When they turned the corner of the path she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood still. In the wide
walk between the pines, gazing rather frightened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could distinguish
nothing for some moments; the greying light robbed things of their
colour. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried, hastening forward.

<p/>It was very still. The tree was tall and straggling. It had thrown its
briers over a hawthorn-bush, and its long streamers trailed thick, right
down to the grass, splashing the darkness everywhere with great spilt
stars, pure white. In bosses of ivory and in large splashed stars the
roses gleamed on the darkness of foliage and stems and grass. Paul and
Miriam stood close together, silent, and watched. Point after point the
steady roses shone out to them, seeming to kindle something in their
souls. The dusk came like smoke around, and still did not put out the
roses.

<p/>Paul looked into Miriam's eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was pale and expectant with wonder,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lips were parted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark eyes lay open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) look seemed
to travel down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul quivered. It was the communion she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned aside, as if pained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned to the bush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They seem as if they walk like butterflies, and shake themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) roses. They were white, some incurved and holy, others
expanded in an ecstasy. The tree was dark as a shadow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
hand impulsively to the flowers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went forward and touched them in
worship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>There was a cool scent of ivory roses--a white, virgin scent. Something
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feel anxious and imprisoned. The two walked in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till Sunday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said quietly, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) walked home
slowly, feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul satisfied with the holiness of the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
stumbled down the path. And as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was out of the wood, in the
free open meadow, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could breathe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) started to run as fast as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could. It was like a delicious delirium in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) veins.

<p/>Always when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went with Miriam, and it grew rather late, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mother was fretting and getting angry about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)--why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not
understand. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went into the house, flinging down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cap, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother
looked up at the clock. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been sitting thinking, because a chill
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reading. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could feel Paul being drawn away
by this girl. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not care for Miriam. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is one of those who
will want to suck a man's soul out till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has none of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own left,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said to herself; <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is just such a gaby as to let himself be
absorbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will never let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) become a man; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never will.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was away with Miriam, Mrs. Morel grew more and more worked up.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) glanced at the clock and said, coldly and rather tired:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been far enough to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul, warm and exposed from contact with the girl, shrank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have been right home with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother continued.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not answer. Mrs. Morel, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) quickly, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hair
was damp on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) forehead with haste, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) frowning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heavy
fashion, resentfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must be wonderfully fascinating, that you can't get away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
but must go trailing eight miles at this time of night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was hurt between the past glamour with Miriam and the knowledge
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother fretted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had meant not to say anything, to refuse to
answer. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not harden his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart to ignore his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I DO like to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered irritably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there nobody else to talk to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't say anything if I went with Edgar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I should. You know, whoever you went with, I should say it
was too far for you to go trailing, late at night, when you've been
to Nottingham. Besides'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice suddenly flashed into anger and
contempt--<div class="bookquote">``it is disgusting--bits of lads and girls courting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is NOT courting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what else you call it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not! Do you think we SPOON and do? We only talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till goodness knows what time and distance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>was the sarcastic
rejoinder.

<p/>Paul snapped at the laces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) boots angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you so mad about?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Because you don't like her (<font color='blue'><b>lads</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say I don't like her (<font color='blue'><b>lads</b></font>). But I don't hold with children keeping
company, and never did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't mind our Annie going out with Jim Inger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've more sense than you two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Annie's not one of the deep sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) failed to see the meaning of this remark. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked
tired. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was never so strong after William's death; and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes hurt
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's so pretty in the country. Mr. Sleath asked about
you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'d missed you. Are you a bit better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have been in bed a long time ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, mother, you know you wouldn't have gone before quarter-past ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I should!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, little woman, you'd say anything now you're disagreeable with me,
wouldn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forehead that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knew so well: the deep marks between the
brows, the rising of the fine hair, greying now, and the proud setting
of the temples. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hand lingered on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulder after his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) kiss. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went slowly to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had forgotten Miriam; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) only saw how his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
mother's hair was lifted back from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) warm, broad brow. And somehow,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was hurt.

<p/>Then the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saw Miriam he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let me be late to-night--not later than ten o'clock. My mother
gets so upset.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bead, brooding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) get upset?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says I oughtn't to be out late when I have to get up
early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam, rather quietly, with just a touch of a sneer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) resented that. And he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was usually late again.

<p/>That there was any love growing between him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and Miriam neither of
them would have acknowledged. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was too sane for such
sentimentality, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought herself too lofty. They both were late
in coming to maturity, and psychical ripeness was much behind even the
physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mother had always
been. The slightest grossness made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) recoil almost in anguish. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
brothers were brutal, but never coarse in speech. The men did all
the discussing of farm matters outside. But, perhaps, because of the
continual business of birth and of begetting which goes on upon every
farm, Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) blood
was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest suggestion of such
intercourse. Paul took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pitch from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and their intimacy went on in
an utterly blanched and chaste fashion. It could never be mentioned that
the mare was in foal.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was nineteen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was earning only twenty shillings a week, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was happy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) painting went well, and life went well enough. On the
Good Friday he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone. There were three
lads of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own age, then Annie and Arthur, Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur,
apprenticed as an electrician in Nottingham, was home for the holiday.
Morel, as usual, was up early, whistling and sawing in the yard. At
seven o'clock the family heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) buy threepennyworth of hot-cross
buns; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) talked with gusto to the little girl who brought them, calling
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``my darling'' (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) turned away several boys who came with more buns,
telling them they had been <div class="bookquote">``kested''  (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel
got up, and the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to
everybody, this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday.
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed,
sitting in their shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury. The
room was warm. Everything felt free of care and anxiety. There was a
sense of plenty in the house.

<p/>While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden. They were
now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill Street home, which
had been left soon after William had died. Directly came an excited cry
from the garden:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul! Paul! come and look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother's voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) book and went out. There
was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day, with a
sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away Bestwood began,
with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which rose the church
tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel. And beyond went woods
and hills, right away to the pale grey heights of the Pennine Chain.

<p/>Paul looked down the garden for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head appeared among the
young currant-bushes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been looking at the buds on the currant trees. Paul went up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that here I might never have seen them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son went to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) side. Under the fence, in a little bed, was a ravel
of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs, and three
scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, just see those!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed. ``I was looking at the currant
bushes, when, thinks I to myself, ``There's something very blue; is it
a bit of sugar-bag?<div class="bookquote">'' and there, behold you! Sugar-bag! Three glories of
the snow, and such beauties! But where on earth did they come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>``Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed and blade in
this garden. But HAVEN<div class="bookquote">``T they done well? You see, that gooseberry-bush
just shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) crouched down and turned up the bells of the little blue flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're a glorious colour!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't they!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I guess they come from Switzerland, where
they say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against the snow! But
where have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here, can they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) remembered having set here a lot of little trash of bulbs to
mature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you never told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never had a glory
of the snow in my garden in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was full of excitement and elation. The garden was an endless joy to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Paul was thankful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sake at last to be in a house with a long
garden that went down to a field. Every morning after breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went
out and was happy pottering about in it. And it was true, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew every
weed and blade.

<p/>Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they set off,
a merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the mill-race,
dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel and watched it
shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge over Boathouse
Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard</b></font>)</div>said
Leonard, whose father was a signalman. <div class="bookquote">``Lad, but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) doesn't half buzz!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>and the little party looked up the lines one way, to London, and the
other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch of these two magical
places.

<p/>In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the public-houses to
open. It was a town of idleness and lounging. At Stanton Gate the iron
foundry blazed. Over everything there were great discussions. At Trowell
they crossed again from Derbyshire into Nottinghamshire. They came to
the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time. Its field was crowded with folk from
Nottingham and Ilkeston.

<p/>They had expected a venerable and dignified monument. They found
a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a decayed
mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field. Leonard and
Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials, <div class="bookquote">``L. W.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``R. P.'' (<font color='red'><b>Dick</b></font>)</div>,
in the old red sandstone; but Paul desisted, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had read in the
newspaper satirical remarks about initial-carvers, who could find no
other road to immortality. Then all the lads climbed to the top of the
rock to look round.

<p/>Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating
lunch or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor. It had
yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders of yellow crocuses round the
lawn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul to Miriam, <div class="bookquote">``what a quiet garden!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked
gratefully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had not seemed to belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) among all these others;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was different then--not her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) Paul, who understood the slightest quiver
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) innermost soul, but something else, speaking another language
than hers. How it hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and deadened her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) very perceptions. Only when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came right back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) other, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lesser self, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
thought, would she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) feel alive again. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to look at
this garden, wanting the contact with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) again. Impatient of the set
in the field, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of
shut-up crocuses. A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It felt almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) were alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in this garden.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) again and joined the others. Soon they started home.
Miriam loitered behind, alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not fit in with the others; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
could very rarely get into human relations with anyone: so her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) friend,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) companion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lover, was Nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw the sun declining wanly.
In the dusky, cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lingered to
gather them, tenderly, passionately. The love in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) finger-tips
caressed the leaves; the passion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart came to a glow upon the
leaves.

<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) realised she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was alone in a strange road, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hurried
forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) came upon Paul, who stood
bent over something, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mind fixed on it, working away steadily,
patiently, a little hopelessly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hesitated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) approach, to watch.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond, one rift of
rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stand out
in dark relief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), slender and firm, as if the setting sun had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). A deep pain took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
must love him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had discovered him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), discovered in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a
rare potentiality, discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loneliness. Quivering as at some
<div class="bookquote">``annunciation'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went slowly forward.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed gratefully, <div class="bookquote">``have you waited for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw a deep shadow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The spring broken here;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) where his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) umbrella was
injured.

<p/>Instantly, with some shame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had not done the damage himself,
but that Geoffrey was responsible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>), who did not usually trouble over trifles, made such
a mountain of this molehill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) said
quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.

<p/>The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) vision of him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>). But there was
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) a certain reserve, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dared not comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>), not even
speak softly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can't do it;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and they went in silence along the
road.

<p/>That same evening they were walking along under the trees by Nether
Green. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) was talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fretfully, seemed to be struggling to
convince himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) said, with an effort, <div class="bookquote">``if one person loves, the other
does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered. ``Like mother said to me when I was little, <div class="bookquote">``Love
begets love.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very terrible
thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but it IS--at least with most people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) answered.

<p/>And Miriam, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) had assured himself, felt strong in herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
always regarded that sudden coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) in the lane as a revelation.
And this conversation remained graven in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mind as one of the letters
of the law.

<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood with him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) and for him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>). When, about this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) outraged
the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stuck
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>), and believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) was right. And at this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dreamed
dreams of him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>), vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came again later on,
developed to a more subtle psychological stage.

<p/>On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion to Wingfield
Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a train at Sethley
Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd. They left the
train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in the street and in the colliers
with their dogs. Here was a new race of miners. Miriam did not live till
they came to the church. They were all rather timid of entering, with
their bags of food, for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin
fellow, went first; Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back,
went last. The place was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds of
white narcissi seemed to be growing. The air was dim and coloured from
the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies and narcissi. In
that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow. Paul was afraid of the
things he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mustn't do; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was sensitive to the feel of the place.
Miriam turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered. They were together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not go
beyond the Communion-rail. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul expanded
into prayer beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt the strange fascination of shadowy
religious places. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) latent mysticism quivered into life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was
drawn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was a prayer along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once became awkward
in conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). So usually she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was silent.

<p/>It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor.
All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm and
enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was tip-top full
with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft, atmospheric grey
of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything near the ruin, was
perfect.

<p/>The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls are blank and
calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went in trepidation, almost
afraid that the delight of exploring this ruin might be denied them. In
the first courtyard, within the high broken walls, were farm-carts, with
their shafts lying idle on the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant
with gold-red rust. It was very still.

<p/>All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through the fine
clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy. Here on the pavement,
where the hall had been, an old thorn tree was budding. All kinds of
strange openings and broken rooms were in the shadow around them.

<p/>After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin. This time the
girls went with the boys, who could act as guides and expositors. There
was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering, where they say Mary
Queen of Scots was imprisoned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of the Queen going up here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam in a low voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
climbed the hollow stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) could get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had rheumatism like anything.
I reckon they treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) rottenly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) deserved it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>asked Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was only lively.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind, blowing
through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft, and filled the girl's
skirts like a balloon, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was ashamed, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took the hem
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dress and held it down for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did it perfectly simply, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
would have picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glove. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) remembered this always.

<p/>Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out, old and handsome.
Also, there were a few chill gillivers, in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted
to lean over for some ivy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Instead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had to
wait behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and take from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) each spray as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gathered it and held
it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), each one separately, in the purest manner of chivalry. The
tower seemed to rock in the wind. They looked over miles and miles of
wooded country, and country with gleams of pasture.

<p/>The crypt underneath the manor was beautiful, and in perfect
preservation. Paul made a drawing: Miriam stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was
thinking of Mary Queen of Scots looking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) strained, hopeless
eyes, that could not understand misery, over the hills whence no help
came, or sitting in this crypt, being told of a God as cold as the place
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sat in.

<p/>They set off again gaily, looking round on their beloved manor that
stood so clean and big on its hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Supposing you could have THAT farm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul to Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it be lovely to come and see you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now in the bare country of stone walls, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved, and
which, though only ten miles from home, seemed so foreign to Miriam. The
party was straggling. As they were crossing a large meadow that
sloped away from the sun, along a path embedded with innumerable tiny
glittering points, Paul, walking alongside, laced his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers in the
strings of the bag Miriam was carrying, and instantly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt Annie
behind, watchful and jealous. But the meadow was bathed in a glory of
sunshine, and the path was jewelled, and it was seldom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
any sign. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fingers very still among the strings of the bag,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers touching; and the place was golden as a vision.

<p/>At last they came into the straggling grey village of Crich, that lies
high. Beyond the village was the famous Crich Stand that Paul could see
from the garden at home. The party pushed on. Great expanse of country
spread around and below. The lads were eager to get to the top of the
hill. It was capped by a round knoll, half of which was by now cut away,
and on the top of which stood an ancient monument, sturdy and squat, for
signalling in old days far down into the level lands of Nottinghamshire
and Leicestershire.

<p/>It was blowing so hard, high up there in the exposed place, that the
only way to be safe was to stand nailed by the wind to the wan of the
tower. At their feet fell the precipice where the limestone was quarried
away. Below was a jumble of hills and tiny villages--Mattock, Ambergate,
Stoney Middleton. The lads were eager to spy out the church of Bestwood,
far away among the rather crowded country on the left. They were
disgusted that it seemed to stand on a plain. They saw the hills of
Derbyshire fall into the monotony of the Midlands that swept away South.

<p/>Miriam was somewhat scared by the wind, but the lads enjoyed it. They
went on, miles and miles, to Whatstandwell. All the food was eaten,
everybody was hungry, and there was very little money to get home with.
But they managed to procure a loaf and a currant-loaf, which they hacked
to pieces with shut-knives, and ate sitting on the wall near the bridge,
watching the bright Derwent rushing by, and the brakes from Matlock
pulling up at the inn.

<p/>Paul was now pale with weariness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been responsible for the party
all day, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was done. Miriam understood, and kept close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left himself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands.

<p/>They had an hour to wait at Ambergate Station. Trains came, crowded with
excursionists returning to Manchester, Birmingham, and London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We might be going there--folk easily might think we're going that far,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>They got back rather late. Miriam, walking home with Geoffrey, watched
the moon rise big and red and misty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt something was fulfilled in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had an elder sister, Agatha, who was a school-teacher. Between the
two girls was a feud. Miriam considered Agatha worldly. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted
herself to be a school-teacher.

<p/>One Saturday afternoon Agatha and Miriam were upstairs dressing. Their
bedroom was over the stable. It was a low room, not very large, and
bare. Miriam had nailed on the wall a reproduction of Veronese's <div class="bookquote">``St.
Catherine'' (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved the woman who sat in the window, dreaming. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
own windows were too small to sit in. But the front one was dripped over
with honeysuckle and virginia creeper, and looked upon the tree-tops of
the oak-wood across the yard, while the little back window, no bigger
than a handkerchief, was a loophole to the east, to the dawn beating up
against the beloved round hills.

<p/>The two sisters did not talk much to each other. Agatha, who was fair
and small and determined, had rebelled against the home atmosphere,
against the doctrine of <div class="bookquote">``the other cheek'' (<font color='red'><b>Agatha</b></font>)</div>. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) was out in the world now,
in a fair way to be independent. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) insisted on worldly values,
on appearance, on manners, on position, which Miriam would fain have
ignored.

<p/>Both girls liked to be upstairs, out of the way, when Paul came. They
preferred to come running down, open the stair-foot door, and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
watching, expectant of them. Miriam stood painfully pulling over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
head a rosary he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It caught in the fine mesh of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hair.
But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had it on, and the red-brown wooden beads looked well
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cool brown neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was a well-developed girl, and very
handsome. But in the little looking-glass nailed against the whitewashed
wall she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could only see a fragment of herself at a time. Agatha had
bought a little mirror of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) own, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) propped up to suit herself.
Miriam was near the window. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heard the well-known click of
the chain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw Paul fling open the gate, push his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle into
the yard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) look at the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shrank away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walked
in a nonchalant fashion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as if it were a
live thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul's come!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you glad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agatha</b></font>)</div>said Agatha cuttingly.

<p/>Miriam stood still in amazement and bewilderment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I'm not going to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) see it, and think I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam was startled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle in the stable
underneath, and talking to Jimmy, who had been a pit-horse, and who was
seedy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Jimmy my lad, how are ter? Nobbut sick an' sadly, like? Why,
then, it's a shame, my owd lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heard the rope run through the hole as the horse lifted its head
from the lad's caress. How she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved to listen when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) thought only
the horse could hear. But there was a serpent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) Eden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) searched
earnestly in herself to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted Paul Morel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt there
would be some disgrace in it. Full of twisted feeling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was afraid
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did want him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood self-convicted. Then came an agony of new
shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shrank within herself in a coil of torture. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) want Paul
Morel, and did he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) know she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)? What a subtle infamy upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) whole soul coiled into knots of shame.

<p/>Agatha was dressed first, and ran downstairs. Miriam heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) greet
the lad gaily, knew exactly how brilliant her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) grey eyes became with that
tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) herself would have felt it bold to have greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) in such
wise. Yet there she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood under the self-accusation of wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),
tied to that stake of torture. In bitter perplexity she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) kneeled down and
prayed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Lord, let me not love Paul Morel. Keep me from loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), if I ought
not to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Something anomalous in the prayer arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head and
pondered. How could it be wrong to love him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)? Love was God's gift. And
yet it caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shame. That was because of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), Paul Morel. But, then,
it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) affair, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) own, between herself and God. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was
to be a sacrifice. But it was God's sacrifice, not Paul Morel's or her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
own. After a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face in the pillow again, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Lord, if it is Thy will that I should love him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), make me love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)--as Christ would, who died for the souls of men. Make me love him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
splendidly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) is Thy son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) remained kneeling for some time, quite still, and deeply moved, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
black hair against the red squares and the lavender-sprigged squares of
the patchwork quilt. Prayer was almost essential to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fell
into that rapture of self-sacrifice, identifying herself with a God who
was sacrificed, which gives to so many human souls their deepest bliss.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went downstairs Paul was lying back in an armchair, holding
forth with much vehemence to Agatha, who was scorning a little painting
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had brought to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>). Miriam glanced at the two, and avoided their
levity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went into the parlour to be alone.

<p/>It was tea-time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was able to speak to Paul, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
manner was so distant he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>Miriam discontinued her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) practice of going each Thursday evening to the
library in Bestwood. After calling for Paul regularly during the whole
spring, a number of trifling incidents and tiny insults from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) family
awakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to their attitude towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) decided to go no
more. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) announced to Paul one evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would not call at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
house again for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) on Thursday nights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked, very short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. Only I'd rather not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) faltered, <div class="bookquote">``if you'd care to meet me, we could still go
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meet you where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Somewhere--where you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't meet you anywhere. I don't see why you shouldn't keep calling
for me. But if you won't, I don't want to meet you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>So the Thursday evenings which had been so precious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
were dropped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) worked instead. Mrs. Morel sniffed with satisfaction at
this arrangement.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not have it that they were lovers. The intimacy between them
had been kept so abstract, such a matter of the soul, all thought and
weary struggle into consciousness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw it only as a platonic
friendship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stoutly denied there was anything else between them.
Miriam was silent, or else she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) very quietly agreed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was a fool who
did not know what was happening to himself. By tacit agreement they
ignored the remarks and insinuations of their acquaintances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We aren't lovers, we are friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``WE know it. Let
them talk. What does it matter what they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sometimes, as they were walking together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) arm timidly
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) always resented it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew it. It caused a
violent conflict in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). With Miriam he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was always on the high plane of
abstraction, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) natural fire of love was transmitted into the fine
stream of thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would have it so. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were jolly and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
put it, flippant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), till the change
had taken place in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was wrestling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own soul,
frowning, passionate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) desire for understanding. And in this
passion for understanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul lay close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) all to
herself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) must be made abstract first.

<p/>Then, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), it caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) almost torture. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
consciousness seemed to split. The place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ran
hot with friction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was one internecine battle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) became cruel to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) because of it.

<p/>One evening in midsummer Miriam called at the house, warm from climbing.
Paul was alone in the kitchen; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother could be heard moving about
upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and look at the sweet-peas,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to the girl.

<p/>They went into the garden. The sky behind the townlet and the church was
orange-red; the flower-garden was flooded with a strange warm light that
lifted every leaf into significance. Paul passed along a fine row of
sweet-peas, gathering a blossom here and there, all cream and pale blue.
Miriam followed, breathing the fragrance. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), flowers appealed with
such strength she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) must make them part of herself. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bent
and breathed a flower, it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and the flower were loving each
other. Paul hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) for it. There seemed a sort of exposure about the
action, something too intimate.


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had got a fair bunch, they returned to the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) listened
for a moment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's quiet movement upstairs, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here, and let me pin them in for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arranged them two or
three at a time in the bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dress, stepping back now and then to
see the effect. <div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, taking the pin out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth, <div class="bookquote">``a
woman ought always to arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flowers before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam laughed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought flowers ought to be pinned in one's dress
without any care. That Paul should take pains to fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) flowers for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whim.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was rather offended at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some women do--those who look decent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Miriam laughed again, but mirthlessly, to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thus mix her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) up with
women in a general way. From most men she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would have ignored it. But
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) it hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had nearly finished arranging the flowers when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's
footstep on the stairs. Hurriedly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pushed in the last pin and turned
away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let mater know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Miriam picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) books and stood in the doorway looking with chagrin
at the beautiful sunset. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would call for Paul no more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening, Mrs. Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, in a deferential way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sounded
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had no right to be there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, is it you, Miriam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Morel coolly.

<p/>But Paul insisted on everybody's accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) friendship with the girl,
and Mrs. Morel was too wise to have any open rupture.

<p/>It was not till he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was twenty years old that the family could ever
afford to go away for a holiday. Mrs. Morel had never been away for a
holiday, except to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sister, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had been married. Now at
last Paul had saved enough money, and they were all going. There was to
be a party: some of Annie's friends, one friend of Paul's, a young man
in the same office where William had previously been, and Miriam.

<p/>It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother debated
it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished cottage for two
weeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought one week would be enough, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) insisted on two.

<p/>At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they
wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation. Paul
was wild with joy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have a real holiday
now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat at evening picturing what it would be like. Annie
came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty. There was wild rejoicing and
anticipation. Paul told Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed to brood with joy over it.
But the Morel's house rang with excitement.

<p/>They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train. Paul suggested
that Miriam should sleep at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) house, because it was so far for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
to walk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) came down for supper. Everybody was so excited that even
Miriam was accepted with warmth. But almost as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) entered the
feeling in the family became close and tight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had discovered a poem
by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) must read it
to Miriam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would never have got so far in the direction of
sentimentality as to read poetry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own family. But now they
condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofa absorbed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
always seemed absorbed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and by him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was present. Mrs.
Morel sat jealously in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was going to hear also. And
even Annie and the father attended, Morel with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head cocked on one
side, like somebody listening to a sermon and feeling conscious of
the fact. Paul ducked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head over the book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had got now all the
audience he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cared for. And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested with
Miriam who should listen best and win his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) favour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was in very high
feather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs. Morel, ``what IS the <div class="bookquote">``Bride of Enderby' that the
bells are supposed to ring?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning against
water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
replied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had not the faintest knowledge what it really was, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) womenfolk. They
listened and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) believed himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the people knew what that tune meant?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/>``Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard <div class="bookquote">``The Flowers o' the
Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie. <div class="bookquote">``A bell sounds the same whether it's rung backwards
or forwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you start with the deep bell and ring up to the high
one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought so too.
Then, waiting a minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued the poem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) finished. <div class="bookquote">``But I wish
everything that's written weren't so sad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/>There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.

<p/>Miriam rose to help with the pots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let ME help to wash up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>cried Annie. <div class="bookquote">``You sit down again. There aren't many.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down again to look
at the book with Paul.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was master of the party; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father was no good. And great tortures
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby instead of at
Mablethorpe. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wasn't equal to getting a carriage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bold little
mother did that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried to a man. <div class="bookquote">``Here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two shillings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how far is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old seaside
carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``it's only threepence each, and if it were a
tramcar--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it this? Now, this is it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was a universal sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm thankful it wasn't that brute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I WAS
frightened.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They drove on and on.

<p/>At last they descended at a house that stood alone over the dyke by the
highroad. There was wild excitement because they had to cross a little
bridge to get into the front garden. But they loved the house that lay
so solitary, with a sea-meadow on one side, and immense expanse of land
patched in white barley, yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops,
flat and stretching level to the sky.

<p/>Paul kept accounts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother ran the show. The total
expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillings a week per
person. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and Leonard went bathing in the mornings. Morel was wandering
abroad quite early.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother called from the bedroom, <div class="bookquote">``eat a piece of
bread-and-butter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got back he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother presiding in state at the
breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband was
blind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed the pots in
the kitchen and made the beds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you said you'd have a real holiday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``and now you work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Work!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) across the fields to the village and the sea.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was afraid of the plank bridge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) for being a baby.
On the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stuck to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were HER man.

<p/>Miriam did not get much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), except, perhaps, when all the others
went to the <div class="bookquote">``Coons'' (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>. Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
thought they were to himself also, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) preached priggishly to Annie
about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), too, knew all their
songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found
himself listening, the stupidity pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) very much. Yet to Annie he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with more
gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And to Miriam
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, with much scorn of Annie and the others: <div class="bookquote">``I suppose they're at
the `Coons'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had a straight chin
that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sang, even
when it was:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come down lover's lane
For a walk with me, talk with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sketched, or at evening when the others were at the
<div class="bookquote">``Coons'' (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) endlessly about his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky and land in
Lincolnshire, meant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) the eternality of the will, just as the bowed
Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves, meant the dogged
leaping forward of the persistent human soul, on and on, nobody knows
where; in contradiction to the perpendicular lines and to the Gothic
arch, which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) said, leapt up at heaven and touched the ecstasy and
lost itself in the divine. Himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) said, was Norman, Miriam was
Gothic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bowed in consent even to that.

<p/>One evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went up the great sweeping shore of sand towards
Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran in a hiss of foam along
the coast. It was a warm evening. There was not a figure but themselves
on the far reaches of sand, no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul
loved to see it clanging at the land. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved to feel himself between
the noise of it and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
Everything grew very intense. It was quite dark when they turned again.
The way home was through a gap in the sandhills, and then along a raised
grass road between two dykes. The country was black and still. From
behind the sandhills came the whisper of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked
in silence. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) started. The whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood seemed to burst
into flame, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was
staring at them from the rim of the sandhills. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood still, looking
at it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>cried Miriam, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy moon, the
only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart beat
heavily, the muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arms contracted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>murmured Miriam, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), for ever in shadow.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face, covered with the darkness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hat, was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
unseen. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was brooding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was slightly afraid--deeply moved
and religious. That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) best state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was impotent against it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
blood was concentrated like a flame in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chest. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not get
across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). There were flashes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood. But somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) ignored
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was expecting some religious state in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Still yearning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
was half aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) passion, and gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), troubled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the moon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered, frowning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) assented. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it wonderful?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was curious about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
The crisis was past.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not know himself what was the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was naturally so young,
and their intimacy was so abstract, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not know he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to crush
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) breast to ease the ache there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).
The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might want her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) as a man wants a woman had in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
been suppressed into a shame. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shrank in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) convulsed, coiled
torture from the thought of such a thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had winced to the depths of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul. And now this <div class="bookquote">``purity''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>prevented even their first love-kiss.
It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a
passionate kiss, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.

<p/>As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched the moon and did not
speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plodded beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed in some way
to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) despise himself. Looking ahead--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw the one light in the
darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, and the other jolly people.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, everybody else has been in long ago!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother as they
entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried irritably. <div class="bookquote">``I can go a walk if I like,
can't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I should have thought you could get in to supper with the rest,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall please myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) retorted. <div class="bookquote">``It's not LATE. I shall do as I
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother cuttingly, <div class="bookquote">``then DO as you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
took no further notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that evening. Which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pretended neither
to notice nor to care about, but sat reading. Miriam read also,
obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son like this.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) watched Paul growing irritable, priggish, and melancholic. For this
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) put the blame on Miriam. Annie and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) friends joined against
the girl. Miriam had no friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) own, only Paul. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not
suffer so much, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) despised the triviality of these other
people.

<p/>And Paul hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) because, somehow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) spoilt his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ease and
naturalness. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>STRIFE IN LOVE

<p/>ARTHUR finished his (<font color='blue'><b>ARTHUR</b></font>) apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical
plant at Minton Pit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) earned very little, but had a good chance of
getting on. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) was wild and restless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) did not drink nor gamble.
Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes, always through
some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) went rabbiting in the woods,
like a poacher, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) stayed in Nottingham all night instead of coming
home, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) miscalculated his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) dive into the canal at Bestwood, and
scored his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) chest into one mass of wounds on the raw stones and tins at
the bottom.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) had not been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) work many months when again he (<font color='blue'><b>Minton</b></font>) did not come home
one night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know where Arthur is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul at breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) DID anything I shouldn't mind. But
no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) simply can't come away from a game of whist, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must see
a girl home from the skating-rink--quite proprietously--and so can't get
home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'s a fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that it would make it any better if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did something to
make us all ashamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I should respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I very much doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother coldly.

<p/>They went on with breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you fearfully fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you ask that for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they say a woman always like the youngest best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may do--but I don't. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wearies me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'd actually rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) showed some of a man's common sense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul was raw and irritable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) also wearied his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother very often. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
saw the sunshine going out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) resented it.

<p/>As they were finishing breakfast came the postman with a letter from
Derby. Mrs. Morel screwed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes to look at the address.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it here, blind eye!''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>exclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son, snatching it away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) started, and almost boxed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's from your son, Arthur,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What now--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`My dearest Mother,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Paul read, '''I don't know what made me such a
fool. I want you to come and fetch me back from here. I came with Jack
Bredon yesterday, instead of going to work, and enlisted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was
sick of wearing the seat of a stool out, and, like the idiot you know I
am, I came away with him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''I have taken the King's shilling, but perhaps if you came for me they
would let me go back with you. I was a fool when I did it. I don't want
to be in the army. My dear mother, I am nothing but a trouble to you.
But if you get me out of this, I promise I will have more sense and
consideration...'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rocking-chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, NOW,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence. The mother sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) apron,
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face set, thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'm not SICK!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Sick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, beginning to frown, <div class="bookquote">``you're not going to worry your
soul out about this, do you hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I'm to take it as a blessing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flashed, turning on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not going to mount it up to a tragedy, so there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) retorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The FOOL!--the young fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'ll look well in uniform,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul irritatingly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) like a fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, will he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Not in my eyes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) should get in a cavalry regiment; he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'ll have the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) life,
and will look an awful swell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Swell!--SWELL!--a mighty swell idea indeed!--a common soldier!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``what am I but a common clerk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good deal, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, stung.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, a MAN, and not a thing in a red coat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind being in a red coat--or dark blue, that would suit me
better--if they didn't boss me about too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother had ceased to listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was getting on, or might have been getting on, at his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) job--a
young nuisance--here he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) goes and ruins himself for life. What good will
he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) be, do you think, after THIS?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may lick him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) into shape beautifully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lick him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) into shape!--lick what marrow there WAS out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) bones. A
SOLDIER!--a common SOLDIER!--nothing but a body that makes movements
when it hears a shout! It's a fine thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't understand why it upsets you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, perhaps you can't. But I understand'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat back in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chin in one hand, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) elbow with the other, brimmed
up with wrath and chagrin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall you go to Derby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why on earth don't you let him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) stop. It's just what he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) wants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>cried the mother, <div class="bookquote">``YOU know what he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) wants!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got ready and went by the first train to Derby, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
son and the sergeant. It was, however, no good.

<p/>When Morel was having his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) dinner in the evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said suddenly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had to go to Derby to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The miner turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) eyes, showing the whites in his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) black face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has ter, lass. What took thee there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That Arthur!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--an' what's agate now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'s only enlisted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel put down his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) knife and leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) niver `as!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is going down to Aldershot tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the miner. <div class="bookquote">``That's a winder.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) considered it a
moment, said <div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and proceeded with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) dinner. Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face
contracted with wrath. <div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) may never set foot i' my house again,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Saying such a thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>repeated Morel. <div class="bookquote">``A fool as runs away for a soldier, let `im look

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fat sight you have done as it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>And Morel was almost ashamed to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) public-house that evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, did you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And could you see him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) blubbered when I came away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so did I, so you needn't `h'm'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel fretted after her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not like the army.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not. The discipline was intolerable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said with some pride to Paul, <div class="bookquote">``said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was
perfectly proportioned--almost exactly; all his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) measurements were
correct. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) IS good-looking, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s awfully nice-looking. But he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) doesn't fetch the girls like William,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it's a different character. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)'s a good deal like his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) father,
irresponsible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>To console his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, Paul did not go much to Willey Farm at this time.
And in the autumn exhibition of students' work in the Castle he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had two
studies, a landscape in water-colour and a still life in oil, both of
which had first-prize awards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was highly excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think I've got for my pictures, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked, coming
home one evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was glad. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face flushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, how should I know, my boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A first prize for those glass jars--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a first prize for that sketch up at Willey Farm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a rosy, bright look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you praise me up to the skies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have the trouble of dragging you down again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was full of joy, nevertheless. William had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
sporting trophies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) kept them still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
death. Arthur was handsome--at least, a good specimen--and warm and
generous, and probably would do well in the end. But Paul was going to
distinguish himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had a great belief in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), the more because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was unaware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own powers. There was so much to come out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
Life for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was rich with promise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was to see herself fulfilled.
Not for nothing had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) struggle.

<p/>Several times during the exhibition Mrs. Morel went to the Castle
unknown to Paul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wandered down the long room looking at the other
exhibits. Yes, they were good. But they had not in them a certain
something which she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) demanded for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) satisfaction. Some made her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
jealous, they were so good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked at them a long time trying to
find fault with them. Then suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had a shock that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart
beat. There hung Paul's picture! She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew it as if it were printed on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Name--Paul Morel--First Prize.''

 (<font color='red'><b>public</b></font>)</div><p/>It looked so strange, there in public, on the walls of the Castle
gallery, where in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lifetime she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had seen so many pictures. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
glanced round to see if anyone had noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) again in front of the
same sketch.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt a proud woman. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) met well-dressed ladies going home
to the Park, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thought to herself:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you look very well--but I wonder if YOUR son has two first prizes
in the Castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) walked on, as proud a little woman as any in Nottingham. And
Paul felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had done something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), if only a trifle. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work
was hers.

<p/>One day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was going up Castle Gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) met Miriam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
on the Sunday, and had not expected to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was walking
with a rather striking woman, blonde, with a sullen expression, and a
defiant carriage. It was strange how Miriam, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bowed, meditative
bearing, looked dwarfed beside this woman with the handsome shoulders.
Miriam watched Paul searchingly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gaze was on the stranger, who
ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The girl saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) masculine spirit rear its head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you didn't tell me you were coming to town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>replied Miriam, half apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``I drove in to Cattle Market
with father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've told you about Mrs. Dawes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam huskily; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was nervous.
<div class="bookquote">``Clara, do you know Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes/Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Dawes indifferently, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had scornful grey eyes, a skin like white
honey, and a full mouth, with a slightly lifted upper lip that did not
know whether it was raised in scorn of all men or out of eagerness to be
kissed, but which believed the former. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) head back, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had drawn away in contempt, perhaps from men also. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) wore a large,
dowdy hat of black beaver, and a sort of slightly affected simple dress
that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) look rather sack-like. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was evidently poor, and had not
much taste. Miriam usually looked nice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you seen me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul asked of the woman.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would not trouble to answer. Then:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walking with Louie Travers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>Louie was one of the <div class="bookquote">``Spiral''  (<font color='red'><b>Louie/Louie Travers</b></font>)</div>girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) turned to Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What train are you going home by?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am driving with father. I wish you could come too. What time are you
free?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know not till eight to-night, damn it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>And directly the two women moved on.

<p/>Paul remembered that Clara Dawes was the daughter of an old friend of
Mrs. Leivers. Miriam had sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) out because she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had once been Spiral
overseer at Jordan's, and because her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) husband, Baxter Dawes, was smith
for the factory, making the irons for cripple instruments, and so on.
Through her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) Miriam felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) got into direct contact with Jordan's, and
could estimate better Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) husband, and had taken up Women's Rights. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was supposed to be
clever. It interested Paul.

<p/>Baxter Dawes he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) knew and disliked. The smith was a man of thirty-one or
thirty-two. He (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) came occasionally through Paul's corner--a big, well-set
man, also striking to look at, and handsome. There was a peculiar
similarity between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the same white skin,
with a clear, golden tinge. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair was of soft brown, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moustache
was golden. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a similar defiance in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bearing and manner. But
then came the difference. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were
dissolute. They protruded very slightly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyelids hung over them
in a way that was half hate. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, too, was sensual. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole
manner was of cowed defiance, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were ready to knock anybody
down who disapproved of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really disapproved of
himself.

<p/>From the first day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
deliberate gaze of an artist on his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) got into a fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are yer lookin' at?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) sneered, bullying.

<p/>The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind the counter
and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) speech was dirty, with a kind of
rottenness. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) found the youth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) cool, critical gaze fixed
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) face. The smith started round as if he (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) had been stung.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What'r yer lookin' at, three hap`orth o' pap?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) snarled.

<p/>The boy shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) shoulders slightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why yer--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes/Dawes</b></font>)</div>shouted Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating voice which
means, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s only one of your good little sops who can't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pappleworth/Pappleworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came
through with the same curious criticism, glancing away before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met the
smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated each other in silence.

<p/>Clara Dawes had no children. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) husband the home had
been broken up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had gone to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) mother. Dawes lodged
with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and somehow Paul
knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was a
handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet flushed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
walked along to the station with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) went home.

<p/>The next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had
a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The others, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
father and mother and the young children, had gone out, so the two had
the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room. There were three of
Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) photo was on the mantelpiece.
On the table and on the high old rosewood piano were bowls of coloured
leaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat in the armchair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) crouched on the hearthrug near his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
feet. The glow was warm on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) handsome, pensive face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) kneeled
there like a devotee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) doesn't look very amiable,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but don't you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)'s a fine woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, in a deep tone,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) for some
things. IS she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) disagreeable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)'s dissatisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was to have revulsions so soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>repeated Miriam bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I should have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had enough fight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) to match him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>)
said.

<p/>Miriam bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) queried satirically. <div class="bookquote">``What makes you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) mouth--made for passion--and the very setback of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
throat--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) head back in Clara's defiant manner.

<p/>Miriam bowed a little lower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>There was a silence for some moments, while he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) thought of Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what were the things you liked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) skin and the texture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)--I don't
know--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). I appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) as
an artist, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way. It
irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't really like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>), do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) asked the girl.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) great, dazzled dark eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't--you can't--not really.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)'s got a grudge
against men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes/Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>That was more probably one of his (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) own reasons for liking Mrs. Dawes,
but this did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>). They were silent. There had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>)
forehead a knitting of the brows which was becoming habitual with him (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>),
particularly when he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) was with Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) longed to smooth it away, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was afraid of it. It seemed the stamp of a man who was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) man
in Paul Morel.

<p/>There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) reached
over and pulled out a bunch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you put red berries in your hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why would you look like
some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed with a naked, painful sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you laugh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You never laugh laughter. You only
laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then it almost seems to
hurt you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--just for one minute.
I feel as if it would set something free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) with eyes frightened and struggling--<div class="bookquote">``I
do laugh at you--I DO.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh I could
always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering. Oh, you make me
knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head despairingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't want to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) remained silent, thinking, <div class="bookquote">``Then why don't you be otherwise.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) in two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, there, it's autumn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and everybody feels like a
disembodied spirit then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness between them
thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) seemed so beautiful with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes gone dark, and
looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You make me so spiritual!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lamented. <div class="bookquote">``And I don't want to be
spiritual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) finger from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth with a little pop, and looked up at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) almost challenging. But still her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul was naked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) great dark
eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could have
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in abstract purity he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would have done so. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not
kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thus--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed to leave no other way. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) yearned to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) gave a brief laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``get that French and we'll do some--some Verlaine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said in a deep tone, almost of resignation. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rose and
got the books. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rather red, nervous hands looked so pitiful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was mad to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). But then be dared not--or could
not. There was something prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) kisses were wrong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).
They continued the reading till ten o'clock, when they went into the
kitchen, and Paul was natural and jolly again with the father and
mother. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes were dark and shining; there was a kind of fascination
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went into the barn for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found the front wheel
punctured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall be late,
and then I s'll catch it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) coat, turned up the bicycle,
and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl of water and stood
close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), watching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands doing things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was slim and vigorous, with a kind of easiness even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) most hasty
movements. And busy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) absorbedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted to run her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sides. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) always
wanted to embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not want her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, rising suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Now, could you have done it
quicker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) straightened himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) back was towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) two hands
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sides, and ran them quickly down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so FINE!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed, hating her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) voice, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood roused to a wave of flame
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not seem to realise HIM in all this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might have
been an object. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) never realised the male he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn floor to
see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was trying the brakes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew were broken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you have them mended?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why didn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The back one goes on a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's not safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can use my toe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd had them mended,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do--about four. I'll come to meet you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate. Looking
across, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw through the uncurtained window of the kitchen the heads
of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow. It looked very cosy. The road,
with pine trees, was quite black in front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, jumping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll take care, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) voice already came out of the darkness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) stood a moment watching
the light from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lamp race into obscurity along the ground. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)
turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dog
twinkling after him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), half smothered. For the rest the world was full of
darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle in their stalls.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) prayed earnestly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) safety that night. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)
often lay in anxiety, wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had got home safely.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dropped down the hills on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle. The roads were greasy, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had to let it go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt a pleasure as the machine plunged over the
second, steeper drop in the hill. <div class="bookquote">``Here goes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. It was risky,
because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom, and because of the
brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle seemed
to fall beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved it. Recklessness is almost a man's
revenge on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feels he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is not valued, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) will risk
destroying himself to deprive her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) altogether.

<p/>The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers, silver upon the
blackness, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spun past. Then there was the long climb home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the berries and leaves on to the
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, glancing at them, then away again. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat reading,
alone, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't they pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was cross with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). After a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know whether I mind or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you begrudge them tea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I begrudge whom tea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you so horrid for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, say no more! You've asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to tea, it's quite sufficient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)'ll
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was very angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew it was merely Miriam she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
objected to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flung off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) boots and went to bed.

<p/>Paul went to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) friends the next afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was glad to see
them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock. Everywhere was
clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) black dress
and black apron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rose to meet the visitors. With Edgar she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging. Yet Paul thought the
girl looked so nice in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brown cashmere frock.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) helped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have gladly
proffered, but was afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was rather proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) home. There was
about it now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought, a certain distinction. The chairs were only
wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug and cushions were
cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste; there was a simplicity in
everything, and plenty of books. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was never ashamed in the least of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) home, nor was Miriam of hers, because both were what they should be,
and warm. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was proud of the table; the china was pretty, the
cloth was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not silver nor
the knives ivory-handled; everything looked nice. Mrs. Morel had managed
wonderfully while her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) children were growing up, so that nothing was out
of place.

<p/>Miriam talked books a little. That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) unfailing topic. But Mrs.
Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.

<p/>At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew. Morel never
went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel, like a little
champion, sat at the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pew, Paul at the other end; and at
first Miriam sat next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Then the chapel was like home. It was a
pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars, and flowers. And
the same people had sat in the same places ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was a boy. It
was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit there for an hour and a half,
next to Miriam, and near to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, uniting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) two loves under the
spell of the place of worship. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt warm and happy and religious
at once. And after chapel he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel
spent the rest of the evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) old friend, Mrs. Burns. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
keenly alive on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
never went past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house, the tall
black headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning slowly like
shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), keen and almost
unbearable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) father took one for
themselves once more. It was under the little gallery, opposite the
Morels'. When Paul and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother came in the chapel the Leivers's pew
was always empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was anxious for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not come: it was so
far, and there were so many rainy Sundays. Then, often very late indeed,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came in, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) long stride, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head bowed, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face hidden under
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hat of dark green velvet. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat opposite, was always
in shadow. But it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a very keen feeling, as if all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul
stirred within him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) there. It was not the same glow,
happiness, and pride, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt in having his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother in charge:
something more wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain,
as if there were something he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not get to.

<p/>At this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was beginning to question the orthodox creed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
twenty-one, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was twenty. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was beginning to dread the spring:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) became so wild, and hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so much. All the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went cruelly
smashing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was by nature critical and
rather dispassionate. But Miriam suffered exquisite pain, as, with an
intellect like a knife, the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) religion in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lived and moved and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) being. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
cruel. And when they went alone he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was even more fierce, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bled her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) beliefs till she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) almost lost consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) exults--she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) exults as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) carries him (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) off from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel
cried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart when Paul had gone. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)'s not like an ordinary
woman, who can leave me my share in him (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wants to absorb him (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
wants to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) out and absorb him (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) till there is nothing left of him (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>),
even for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) will never be a man on his (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) own feet--she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) will suck
him (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) up.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), coming home from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walks with Miriam, was wild with torture.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walked biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips and with clenched fists, going at a great
rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood for some minutes, and
did not move. There was a great hollow of darkness fronting him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and on
the black upslopes patches of tiny lights, and in the lowest trough of
the night, a flare of the pit. It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
torn so, almost bewildered, and unable to move? Why did his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother sit
at home and suffer? He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffered badly. But why should she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? And
why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), at the thought
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. If Miriam caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother suffering, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) easily hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) make him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were
uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had not
sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the space breaking into
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)? How he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)! And then, what a rush of tenderness and humility!

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) plunged on again, running home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother saw on him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) the
marks of some agony, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said nothing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talk
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for going so far with Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried in despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied piteously. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I've tried to
like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I've tried and tried, but I can't--I can't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt dreary and hopeless between the two.

<p/>Spring was the worst time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was changeable, and intense and cruel.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) decided to stay away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Then came the hours when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew
Miriam was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) growing restless.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could do nothing. It was as if
something were drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul out towards Willey Farm. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hat and went, saying nothing. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was gone. And
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was on the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sighed with relief. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was cruel again.

<p/>One day in March he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam sitting
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). It was a glistening, white-and-blue day. Big clouds, so
brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole along on the water. The
clear spaces in the sky were of clean, cold blue. Paul lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) back
in the old grass, looking up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not bear to look at Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
seemed to want him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) resisted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) resisted all the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted
now to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) passion and tenderness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted the soul out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) body, and not him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). All his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) strength and
energy she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) drew into herself through some channel which united them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
did not want to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), so that there were two of them, man and woman
together. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted to draw all of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It urged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to an
intensity like madness, which fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as drug-taking might.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deepest satisfaction. And in the end it
frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). There he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay in the white intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) search,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice gradually filled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with fear, so level it was, almost
inhuman, as if in a trance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleaded softly, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
forehead.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay quite still, almost unable to move. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body was somewhere
discarded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? Are you tired?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and it wears you out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed shortly, realising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you always make me like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, very low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it. But your
unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead fashion:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off for you!''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried bitterly--<div class="bookquote">``I! Why, when would you let me take you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and, gathering himself together, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got
up and began to talk trivialities. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt insubstantial. In a vague way
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as much to blame himself. This,
however, did not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hating her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>One evening about this time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had walked along the home road with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood, unable to part. As
the stars came out the clouds closed. They had glimpses of their own
constellation, Orion, towards the west. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jewels glimmered for a
moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dog ran low, struggling with difficulty through the spume of
cloud.

<p/>Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations. They
had gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling, until
they seemed themselves to live in every one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stars. This evening
Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just an ordinary
constellation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had fought against his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) glamour and fascination.
Miriam was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lover's mood carefully. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said nothing
that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) away, till the moment came to part, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood frowning
gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind which the great constellation
must be striding still.

<p/>There was to be a little party at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) house the next day, at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
was to attend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't come and meet you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well; it's not very nice out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I care more for
you than for them. And you understand, don't you? You know it's only
friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam was astonished and hurt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). It had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) an effort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), wanting to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) any further humiliation. A fine rain blew
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) walked along the road. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was hurt deep down; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for being blown about by any wind of authority. And in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart of hearts, unconsciously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was trying to get
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). This she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would never have acknowledged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse. Mr.
Pappleworth left to set up a business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pappleworth</b></font>) own, and Paul remained with
Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wages were to be raised to thirty
shillings at the year-end, if things went well.

<p/>Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) French lesson. Paul
did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) grieved at the thought
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) education's coming to end; moreover, they both loved to
be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac, and did
compositions, and felt highly cultured.

<p/>Friday night was reckoning night for the miners. Morel
<div class="bookquote">``reckoned'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>--shared up the money of the stall--either in the New Inn
at Bretty or in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own house, according as his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fellow-butties wished.
Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's
house.

<p/>Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was still a
tomboy; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was engaged to be married. Paul was studying design.

<p/>Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the week's
earnings were small. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bustled immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dinner, prepared
to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent themselves while
the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy into such a masculine
privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were they to know the exact
amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) father was spluttering
in the scullery, Annie went out to spend an hour with a neighbour. Mrs.
Morel attended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) baking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut that doo-er!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>bawled Morel furiously.

<p/>Annie banged it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), and was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy jaw rattle,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) threatened from the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) soap-suds. Paul and the mother
frowned to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came running out of the scullery, with the soapy water
dripping from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), dithering with cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my sirs!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Wheer's my towel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would
have bullied and blustered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) squatted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heels before the hot
baking-fire to dry himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``F-ff-f!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went, pretending to shudder with cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``It's NOT cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>said
the miner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hair; <div class="bookquote">``nowt b'r a ice-`ouse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shouldn't make that fuss,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi' thy nesh sides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul, curious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I dunno; that's what they say,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``But there's
that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through your ribs like
through a five-barred gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Morel.

<p/>Morel looked down ruefully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sides.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit. My bones fair juts
out on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know where,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>retorted his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Iv`ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had still a wonderfully young body, muscular,
without any fat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) skin was smooth and clear. It might have been the
body of a man of twenty-eight, except that there were, perhaps, too many
blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the coal-dust remained under the
skin, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest was too hairy. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side
ruefully. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fixed belief that, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not get fat,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as thin as a starved rat. Paul looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father's thick,
brownish hands all scarred, with broken nails, rubbing the fine
smoothness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sides, and the incongruity struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). It seemed
strange they were the same flesh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``you had a good figure once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid, like a
child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) didn't hurtle himself up as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
was trying to get in the smallest space he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Morel--<div class="bookquote">``me a good figure! I wor niver much more n'r a
skeleton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Man!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``don't be such a pulamiter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Strewth!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked as if I
wor goin' off in a rapid decline.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've had a constitution like iron,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and never a man had a
better start, if it was body that counted. You should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as
a young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried suddenly to Paul, drawing herself up to imitate
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband's once handsome bearing.

<p/>Morel watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shyly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw again the passion she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
It blazed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) for a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was shy, rather scared, and humble.
Yet again he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) old glow. And then immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt the ruin he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had made during these years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to bustle about, to run away from
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulders.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave a jump.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, tha mucky little `ussy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Cowd as death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have been a salamander,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) laughed, washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) back. It
was very rarely she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would do anything so personal for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The children
did those things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The next world won't be half hot enough for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``tha`lt see as it's draughty for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had finished. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wiped him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in a desultory fashion, and went
upstairs, returning immediately with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shifting-trousers. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
dried he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) struggled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny, with hair on
end, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flannelette shirt hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pit-trousers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood
warming the garments he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was going to put on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pulled
them inside out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) scorched them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness, man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``get dressed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd as a tub o'
water?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pit-trousers and donned decent black. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did all
this on the hearthrug, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have done if Annie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) familiar
friends had been present.

<p/>Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red earthenware
panchion of dough that stood in a corner she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took another handful of
paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped it into a tin. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was doing so Barker knocked and entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) was a quiet, compact little
man, who looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) would go through a stone wall. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) black hair
was cropped short, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) head was bony. Like most miners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) was pale, but
healthy and taut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Evenin', missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) seated himself with a
sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied cordially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's made thy heels crack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno as I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barker</b></font>)</div>said Barker.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen, effacing himself
rather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's missis?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) some time back:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're expectin' us third just now, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) answered, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) keeps pretty middlin', I
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's see--when?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! And she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s kept fairly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, tidy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a blessing, for she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s none too strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. An' I've done another silly trick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm come be-out th' market-bag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can have mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't. I take a string bag always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw the determined little collier buying in the week's groceries and
meat on the Friday nights, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Barker's little, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>)'s ten times the man you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband.

<p/>Just then Wesson entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wesson</b></font>) was thin, rather frail-looking, with a
boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Wesson</b></font>) seven
children. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Wesson</b></font>) wife was a passionate woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you've kested me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wesson</b></font>) said, smiling rather vapidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barker</b></font>)</div>replied Barker.

<p/>The newcomer took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) cap and his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) big woollen muffler. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) nose was
pointed and red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a bit nippy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come to the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I s'll do where I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Both colliers</b></font>)</div><p/>Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come on to the
hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go thy ways i' th' armchair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>cried Morel cheerily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, come, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>insisted Mrs. Morel.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) rose and went awkwardly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly. It was
too great a familiarity. But the fire made him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) blissfully happy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how's that chest of yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Morel.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) smiled again, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) blue eyes rather sunny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's very middlin',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barker</b></font>)</div>said Barker shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``T-t-t-t!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tongue. <div class="bookquote">``Did you have that
flannel singlet made?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, why didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, an' Doomsday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Barker</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Barker.

<p/>Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then, they were
both as hard as nails, physically.

<p/>When Morel was nearly ready he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) pushed the bag of money to Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Count it, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked humbly.

<p/>Paul impatiently turned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) books and pencil, tipped the bag upside
down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver, sovereigns and
loose money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) counted quickly, referred to the checks--the written
papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order. Then Barker
glanced at the checks.

<p/>Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table. Morel, as
master of the house, sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) armchair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) back to the hot fire.
The two butties had cooler seats. None of them counted the money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did we say Simpson's was?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>asked Morel; and the butties cavilled
for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount was put aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' Bill Naylor's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This money also was taken from the pack.

<p/>Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wesson</b></font>) rent
had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each. And because
Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped, Barker and Wesson
took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing. Morel gave each of
them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns; each half a crown
till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling till there were no
more shillings. If there was anything at the end that wouldn't split,
Morel took it and stood drinks.

<p/>Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house before
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) wife came down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heard the door close, and descended. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked
hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) money lying. Paul had been working all the time. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mother counting the week's money, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wrath rising,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``T-t-t-t-t!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>went her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tongue.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) frowned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not work when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was cross. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) counted again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A measly twenty-five shillings!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``How much was the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten pounds eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul irritably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dreaded what was coming.

<p/>``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Naylor</b></font>) gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an' his (<font color='blue'><b>Naylor</b></font>) club this week! But I

show him (<font color='blue'><b>Naylor</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>cried Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't what, I should like to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't carry on again. I can't work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went very quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but how do you think I'm going to
manage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put up with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) go to hell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bonnet-strings grimly. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was fretted he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not bear it. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began to insist on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The two loaves at the top,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``will be done in twenty minutes.
Don't forget them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to market.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) remained alone working. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) usual intense concentration became
unsettled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past seven came a
low knock, and Miriam entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As if at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) tam-o'-shanter and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) long coat,
hanging them up. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a thrill. This might be their own house,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and hers. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) came back and peered over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bent short-sightedly over the drawings.

<p/>It irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) peered so into everything that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
searching him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went into the parlour and returned with a bundle
of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spread it on the floor. It
proved to be a curtain or portiere, beautifully stencilled with a design
on roses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how beautiful!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried.

<p/>The spread cloth, with its wonderful reddish roses and dark green stems,
all so simple, and somehow so wicked-looking, lay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knees before it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark curls dropping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) crouched
voluptuously before his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart beat quickly. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does it seem cruel?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There seems a feeling of cruelty about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's jolly good, whether or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied, folding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work with
a lover's hands.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rose slowly, pondering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will you do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send it to Liberty's. I did it for my mother, but I think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d rather
have the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had spoken with a touch of bitterness, and Miriam
sympathised. Money would have been nothing to HER.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took the cloth back into the parlour. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) returned he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) threw to
Miriam a smaller piece. It was a cushion-cover with the same design.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did that for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fingered the work with trembling hands, and did not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) became
embarrassed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove, the bread!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took the top loaves out, tapped them vigorously. They were done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
put them on the hearth to cool. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went to the scullery, wetted his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
hands, scooped the last white dough out of the punchion, and dropped it
in a baking-tin. Miriam was still bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) painted cloth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood
rubbing the bits of dough from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark eyes one flame of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed
uncomfortably. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began to talk about the design. There was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
the most intense pleasure in talking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work to Miriam. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
passion, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wild blood, went into this intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>),
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talked and conceived his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brought forth to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
imaginations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not understand, any more than a woman understands
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) conceives a child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) womb. But this was life for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>While they were talking, a young woman of about twenty-two, small and
pale, hollow-eyed, yet with a relentless look about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), entered the
room. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a friend at the Morel's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your things off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not stopping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down in the armchair opposite Paul and Miriam, who were on the
sofa. Miriam moved a little farther from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The room was hot, with a
scent of new bread. Brown, crisp loaves stood on the hearth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have expected to see you here to-night, Miriam Leivers,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice wickedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>murmured Miriam huskily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, let's look at your shoes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam remained uncomfortably still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If tha doesna tha durs`na,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>laughed Beatrice.

<p/>Miriam put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) feet from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dress. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) boots had that queer,
irresolute, rather pathetic look about them, which showed how
self-conscious and self-mistrustful she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was. And they were covered with
mud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glory! You're a positive muck-heap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``Who cleans
your boots?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I clean them myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you wanted a job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice. ``It would ha' taken a lot of men
to ha' brought me down here to-night. But love laughs at sludge, doesn't
it, <div class="bookquote">``Postle my duck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Inter alia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lord! are you going to spout foreign languages? What does it mean,
Miriam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a fine sarcasm in the last question, but Miriam did not see
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Among other things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>I believe,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said humbly.

<p/>Beatrice put her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) tongue between her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) teeth and laughed wickedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Among other things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>`Postle?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean love laughs
at mothers, and fathers, and sisters, and brothers, and men friends, and
lady friends, and even at the b`loved himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) affected a great innocence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In fact, it's one big smile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) replied.

<p/>``Up its sleeve, <div class="bookquote">``Postle Morel--you believe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) went
off into another burst of wicked, silent laughter.

<p/>Miriam sat silent, withdrawn into herself. Every one of Paul's
friends delighted in taking sides against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in the
lurch--seemed almost to have a sort of revenge upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you still at school?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>asked Miriam of Beatrice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not had your notice, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect it at Easter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it an awful shame, to turn you off merely because you didn't pass
the exam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Agatha says you're as good as any teacher anywhere. It seems to me
ridiculous. I wonder why you didn't pass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Short of brains, eh, `Postle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice briefly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only brains to bite with,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nuisance!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) cried; and, springing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) seat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) rushed and
boxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had beautiful small hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) wrists while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) wrestled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) broke free, and seized two handfuls
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thick, dark brown hair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) shook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beat!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hair straight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``I
hate you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) laughed with glee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to sit next to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd as lief be neighbours with a vixen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, nevertheless making
place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) between him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did it ruffle his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) pretty hair, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) cried; and, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
hair-comb, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) combed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) straight. <div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) nice little moustache!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) exclaimed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head back and combed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) young moustache.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a wicked moustache, `Postle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a red for danger.
Have you got any of those cigarettes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cigarette-case from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pocket. Beatrice looked inside it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And fancy me having Connie's last cig.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, putting the
thing between her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held a lit match to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) puffed
daintily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks so much, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said mockingly.

<p/>It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) a wicked delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) does it nicely, Miriam?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took a cigarette for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Light, old boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, tilting her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) cigarette at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bent forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) to light his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cigarette at hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was winking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did so. Miriam saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes trembling with mischief, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) full, almost sensual, mouth quivering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was not himself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
could not bear it. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had no connection with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
might as well not have existed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw the cigarette dancing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
full red lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thick hair for being tumbled loose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweet boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, tipping up his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chin and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a little
kiss on the cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll kiss thee back, Beat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha wunna!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) giggled, jumping up and going away. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
shameless, Miriam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam. <div class="bookquote">``By the way, aren't you forgetting the bread?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried, flinging open the oven door.

<p/>Out puffed the bluish smoke and a smell of burned bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, golly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>cried Beatrice, coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) crouched before the
oven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) peered over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``This is what comes of the oblivion
of love, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul was ruefully removing the loaves. One was burnt black on the hot
side; another was hard as a brick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor mater!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to grate it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``Fetch me the nutmeg-grater.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) arranged the bread in the oven. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brought the grater, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
grated the bread on to a newspaper on the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) set the doors open
to blow away the smell of burned bread. Beatrice grated away, puffing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) cigarette, knocking the charcoal off the poor loaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word, Miriam! you're in for it this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miriam in amazement.

<p/>``You'd better be gone when his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother comes in. I know why King Alfred
burned the cakes. Now I see it! <div class="bookquote">``Postle would fix up a tale about his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
work making him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) forget, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) thought it would wash. If that old woman
had come in a bit sooner, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d have boxed the brazen thing's ears who
made the oblivion, instead of poor Alfred's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) giggled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) scraped the loaf. Even Miriam laughed in spite of
herself. Paul mended the fire ruefully.

<p/>The garden gate was heard to bang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>cried Beatrice, giving Paul the scraped loaf. <div class="bookquote">``Wrap it up in a
damp towel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul disappeared into the scullery. Beatrice hastily blew her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) scrapings
into the fire, and sat down innocently. Annie came bursting in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was
an abrupt, quite smart young woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) blinked in the strong light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Smell of burning!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the cigarettes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>replied Beatrice demurely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard had followed Annie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had a long comic face and blue eyes, very
sad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'s left you to settle it between you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) nodded
sympathetically to Miriam, and became gently sarcastic to Beatrice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'s gone off with number nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I just met number five inquiring for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard</b></font>)</div>said Leonard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--we're going to share him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) up like Solomon's baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice.

<p/>Annie laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard</b></font>)</div>said Leonard. <div class="bookquote">``And which bit should you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``I'll let all the others pick first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' you'd have the leavings, like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard</b></font>)</div>said Leonard, twisting up a comic
face.

<p/>Annie was looking in the oven. Miriam sat ignored. Paul entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This bread's a fine sight, our Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you should stop an' look after it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean YOU should do what you're reckoning to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>replied Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) should, shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)</div>cried Beatrice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'd think he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'d got plenty on hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard</b></font>)</div>said Leonard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had a nasty walk, didn't you, Miriam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--but I'd been in all week--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you wanted a bit of a change, like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard</b></font>)</div>insinuated Leonard kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can't be stuck in the house for ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Annie agreed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was
quite amiable. Beatrice pulled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) coat, and went out with Leonard
and Annie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) own boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't forget that bread, our Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>cried Annie. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Miriam. I
don't think it will rain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>When they had all gone, Paul fetched the swathed loaf, unwrapped it, and
surveyed it sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a mess!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>answered Miriam impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``what is it, after all--twopence,
ha`penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but--it's the mater's precious baking, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)'ll take it to
heart. However, it's no good bothering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took the loaf back into the scullery. There was a little distance
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and Miriam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood balanced opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) for some moments
considering, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) behaviour with Beatrice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt guilty
inside himself, and yet glad. For some inscrutable reason it served
Miriam right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was not going to repent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
thinking of as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood suspended. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thick hair was tumbled over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
forehead. Why might she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) not push it back for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and remove the marks
of Beatrice's comb? Why might she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) not press his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) body with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) two hands.
It looked so firm, and every whit living. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would let other girls,
why not her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)?

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) started into life. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) quiver almost with terror as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) quickly pushed the hair off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) forehead and came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half-past eight!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We'd better buck up. Where's your French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam shyly and rather bitterly produced her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) exercise-book. Every week
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wrote for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a sort of diary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) inner life, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) own French.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had found this was the only way to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to do compositions. And
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) diary was mostly a love-letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would read it now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt as
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul's history were going to be desecrated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) present
mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand, firm and warm, rigorously
scoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was reading only the French, ignoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul that
was there. But gradually his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand forgot its work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) read in silence,
motionless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) quivered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''_Ce matin les oiseaux m`ont eveille,'''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) read. <div class="bookquote">''`Il faisait encore un
crepuscule. Mais la petite fenetre de ma chambre etait bleme, et puis,
jaune, et tous les oiseaux du bois eclaterent dans un chanson vif et
resonnant. Toute l'aube tressaillit. J'avais reve de vous. Est-ce
que vous voyez aussi l'aube? Les oiseaux m`eveillent presque tous les
matins, et toujours il y a quelque chose de terreur dans le cri des
grives. Il est si clair_--'''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam sat tremulous, half ashamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) remained quite still, trying to
understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) only knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) love for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>). It was too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) was inadequate. His (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) own love was
at fault, not hers. Ashamed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) work, humbly writing above
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``the past participle conjugated with _avoir_
agrees with the direct object when it precedes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bent forward, trying to see and to understand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) free, fine curls
tickled his (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) started as if they had been red hot, shuddering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>)
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) peering forward at the page, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) red lips parted piteously, the
black hair springing in fine strands across her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) tawny, ruddy cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
was coloured like a pomegranate for richness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) breath came short as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark eyes were naked
with their love, afraid, and yearning. His (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) eyes, too, were dark, and
they hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). They seemed to master her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lost all her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) self-control,
was exposed in fear. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) knew, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) could kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) must
drive something out of himself. And a touch of hate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) crept back
again into his (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) exercise.

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) flung down the pencil, and was at the oven in a leap,
turning the bread. For Miriam he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) was too quick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) started violently,
and it hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) with real pain. Even the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) crouched before the oven
hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). There seemed to be something cruel in it, something cruel in
the swift way he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) pitched the bread out of the tins, caught it up again.
If only he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) had been gentle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) movements she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would have felt so rich
and warm. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was hurt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) returned and finished the exercise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've done well this week,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) was flattered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) diary. It did not repay her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) entirely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You really do blossom out sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to write
poetry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head with joy, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shook it mistrustfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't trust myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should try!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we read, or is it too late?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is late--but we can read just a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was really getting now the food for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) life during the next week.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) copy Baudelaire's <div class="bookquote">``Le Balcon'' (<font color='red'><b>Baudelaire</b></font>)</div>. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) read it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>)
voice was soft and caressing, but growing almost brutal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) had a way of
lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) lips and showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) teeth, passionately and bitterly, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) was much moved. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) did now. It made Miriam feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) were
trampling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dared not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>), but sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head
bowed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not understand why he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) got into such a tumult and fury.
It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wretched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not like Baudelaire, on the whole--nor
Verlaine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Behold her (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) singing in the field
Yon solitary highland lass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That nourished her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart. So did <div class="bookquote">``Fair Ines'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>. And--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a beauteous evening, calm and pure,
And breathing holy quiet like a nun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>These were like herself. And there was he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>), saying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) throat
bitterly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Tu te rappelleras la beaute des caresses_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The poem was finished; he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) took the bread out of the oven, arranging the
burnt loaves at the bottom of the panchion, the good ones at the top.
The desiccated loaf remained swathed up in the scullery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mater needn't know till morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It won't upset her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) so much
then as at night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam looked in the bookcase, saw what postcards and letters he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) had
received, saw what books were there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) took one that had interested
him (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) turned down the gas and they set off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) did not trouble to
lock the door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) was not home again until a quarter to eleven. His (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) mother was seated
in the rocking-chair. Annie, with a rope of hair hanging down her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) back,
remained sitting on a low stool before the fire, her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) elbows on her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
knees, gloomily. On the table stood the offending loaf unswathed. Paul
entered rather breathless. No one spoke. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother was reading the
little local newspaper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) coat, and went to sit down on
the sofa. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother moved curtly aside to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pass. No one spoke.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was very uncomfortable. For some minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat pretending to read a
piece of paper he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found on the table. Then--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot that bread, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>There was no answer from either woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's only twopence ha`penny. I can pay you for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Being angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put three pennies on the table and slid them towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth was shut tightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie, <div class="bookquote">``you don't know how badly my mother is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl sat staring glumly into the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) badly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) overbearing way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could scarcely get home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked closely at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) looked ill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WHY could you scarcely get home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), still sharply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
would not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as white as a sheet sitting here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie, with a
suggestion of tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, WHY?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>insisted Paul. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brows were knitting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes dilating
passionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was enough to upset anybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, <div class="bookquote">``hugging those
parcels--meat, and green-groceries, and a pair of curtains--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, why DID you hug them; you needn't have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then who would?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Annie fetch the meat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and I WOULD fetch the meat, but how was I to know. You were off
with Miriam, instead of being in when my mother came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what was the matter with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied. Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked bluish
round the mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you felt it before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--often enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why haven't you told me?--and why haven't you seen a doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel shifted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) chair, angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hectoring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd never notice anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie. <div class="bookquote">``You're too eager to be off
with Miriam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, am I--and any worse than you with Leonard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was in at a quarter to ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence in the room for a time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wouldn't
have occupied you so entirely as to burn a whole ovenful of bread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beatrice was here as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely. But we know why the bread is spoilt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flashed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you were engrossed with Miriam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Morel hotly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well--then it was NOT!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied angrily.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was distressed and wretched. Seizing a paper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began to read.
Annie, her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) blouse unfastened, her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) long ropes of hair twisted into a
plait, went up to bed, bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a very curt good-night.

<p/>Paul sat pretending to read. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother wanted to upbraid him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) also wanted to know what had made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ill, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was troubled. So,
instead of running away to bed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have liked to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat and
waited. There was a tense silence. The clock ticked loudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better go to bed before your father comes in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother
harshly. <div class="bookquote">``And if you're going to have anything to eat, you'd better get
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's custom to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) some trifle for supper on Friday
night, the night of luxury for the colliers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was too angry to go and
find it in the pantry this night. This insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I WANTED you to go to Selby on Friday night, I can imagine the
scene,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``But you're never too tired to go if SHE will
come for you. Nay, you neither want to eat nor drink then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) go alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you? And why does she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not because I ask her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't come without you want her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what if I DO want her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, nothing, if it was sensible or reasonable. But to go trapseing up
there miles and miles in the mud, coming home at midnight, and got to go
to Nottingham in the morning--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I hadn't, you'd be just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I should, because there's no sense in it. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) so fascinating
that you must follow her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) all that way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel was bitterly
sarcastic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat still, with averted face, stroking with a rhythmic,
jerked movement, the black sateen of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) apron. It was a movement that
hurt Paul to see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``LIKE her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, in the same biting tones. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me
you like nothing and nobody else. There's neither Annie, nor me, nor
anyone now for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What nonsense, mother--you know I don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--I--I tell you I DON<div class="bookquote">``T
love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't even walk with my arm, because I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you fly to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so often?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there nobody else to talk to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not about the things we talk of. There's a lot of things that you're
not interested in, that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel was so intense that Paul began to pant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--painting--and books. YOU don't care about Herbert Spencer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the sad reply. <div class="bookquote">``And YOU won't at my age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but I do now--and Miriam does--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel flashed defiantly, <div class="bookquote">``that I shouldn't.
Do you ever try me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't, mother, you know you don't care whether a picture's
decorative or not; you don't care what MANNER it is in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know I don't care? Do you ever try me? Do you ever talk to
me about these things, to try?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's not that that matters to you, mother, you know t's not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, then--what is it, then, that matters to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) flashed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brows with pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're old, mother, and we're young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) only meant that the interests of HER age were not the interests of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) realised the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had spoken that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had said the wrong
thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know it well--I am old. And therefore I may stand aside; I have
nothing more to do with you. You only want me to wait on you--the rest
is for Miriam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not bear it. Instinctively he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) realised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was life to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).
And, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was the chief thing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), the only supreme thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know it isn't, mother, you know it isn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was moved to pity by his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks a great deal like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, half putting aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
despair.

<p/>``No, mother--I really DON<div class="bookquote">``T love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but I want to come
home to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) collar and tie, and rose, bare-throated, to go
to bed. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stooped to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
neck, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulder, and cried, in a whimpering voice, so
unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) writhed in agony:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear it. I could let another woman--but not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d leave me
no room, not a bit of room--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated Miriam bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I've never--you know, Paul--I've never had a husband--not really--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's hair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth was on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exults so in taking you from me--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not like ordinary
girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) murmured, bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head and
hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulder in misery. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a long,
fervent kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, in a voice trembling with passionate love.

<p/>Without knowing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gently stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``now go to bed. You'll be so tired in the
morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband coming. <div class="bookquote">``There's
your father--now go.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) almost as if in fear.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I'm selfish. If you want her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother looked so strange, Paul kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha--mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said softly.

<p/>Morel came in, walking unevenly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hat was over one corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eye.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) balanced in the doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At your mischief again?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said venomously.

<p/>Mrs. Morel's emotion turned into sudden hate of the drunkard who had
come in thus upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, it is sober,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm--h'm! h'm--h'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) sneered. He (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) went into the passage, hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>)
hat and coat. Then they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) go down three steps to the pantry. He (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>)
returned with a piece of pork-pie in his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) fist. It was what Mrs. Morel
had bought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor was that bought for you. If you can give me no more than
twenty-five shillings, I'm sure I'm not going to buy you pork-pie to
stuff, after you've swilled a bellyful of beer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wha-at--wha-at!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>snarled Morel, toppling in his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) balance. <div class="bookquote">``Wha-at--not
for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) looked at the piece of meat and crust, and suddenly, in a
vicious spurt of temper, flung it into the fire.

<p/>Paul started to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waste your own stuff!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--what!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>suddenly shouted Morel, jumping up and clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fist.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll show yer, yer young jockey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul viciously, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head on one side. <div class="bookquote">``Show
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would at that moment dearly have loved to have a smack at something.
Morel was half crouching, fists up, ready to spring. The young man
stood, smiling with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ussha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>hissed the father, swiping round with a great stroke just past
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dared not, even though so close, really touch the
young man, but swerved an inch away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes upon the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father's mouth, where
in another instant his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fist would have hit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ached for that stroke.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard a faint moan from behind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother was deadly pale and
dark at the mouth. Morel was dancing up to deliver another blow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, so that the word rang.

<p/>Morel started, and stood at attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>moaned the boy. <div class="bookquote">``Mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) began to struggle with herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) open eyes watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), although
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not move. Gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was coming to herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
down on the sofa, and ran upstairs for a little whisky, which at last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could sip. The tears were hopping down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kneeled in
front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not cry, but the tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face quickly.
Morel, on the opposite side of the room, sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
knees glaring across.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a-matter with `er?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Faint!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The elderly man began to unlace his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boots. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stumbled off to bed. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
last fight was fought in that home.

<p/>Paul kneeled there, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be poorly, mother--don't be poorly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said time after time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose, fetched in a large piece of coal, and raked the fire.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cleared the room, put everything straight, laid the things for
breakfast, and brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you go to bed, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'll come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sleep with Annie, mother, not with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I'll sleep in my own bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't sleep with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll sleep in my own bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned out the gas, then followed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) closely upstairs,
carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) candle. On the landing he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face upon the pillow in a fury of misery. And yet,
somewhere in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was at peace because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) still loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother
best. It was the bitter peace of resignation.

<p/>The efforts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father to conciliate him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) next day were a great
humiliation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>Everybody tried to forget the scene.



<p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>DEFEAT OF MIRIAM

<p/>PAUL was dissatisfied with himself and with everything. The deepest
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), or
wounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not bear it. Now it was spring, and
there was battle between him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and Miriam. This year he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a good deal
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was vaguely aware of it. The old feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was
to be a sacrifice to this love, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had had when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) prayed, was
mingled in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) emotions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not at the bottom believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
ever would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not believe in herself primarily: doubted
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could ever be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would demand of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
never saw herself living happily through a lifetime with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw
tragedy, sorrow, and sacrifice ahead. And in sacrifice she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was proud,
in renunciation she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was strong, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not trust herself to support
everyday life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was prepared for the big things and the deep things,
like tragedy. It was the sufficiency of the small day-life she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not
trust.

<p/>The Easter holidays began happily. Paul was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own frank self. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
felt it would go wrong. On the Sunday afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bedroom
window, looking across at the oak-trees of the wood, in whose branches a
twilight was tangled, below the bright sky of the afternoon. Grey-green
rosettes of honeysuckle leaves hung before the window, some already, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
fancied, showing bud. It was spring, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved and dreaded.

<p/>Hearing the clack of the gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood in suspense. It was a bright
grey day. Paul came into the yard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle, which glittered
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walked. Usually he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rang his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bell and laughed towards the house.
To-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walked with shut lips and cold, cruel bearing, that had
something of a slouch and a sneer in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) well by now, and
could tell from that keen-looking, aloof young body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) what was
happening inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). There was a cold correctness in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
bicycle in its place, that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart sink.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) came downstairs nervously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was wearing a new net blouse that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
thought became her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It had a high collar with a tiny ruff, reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
of Mary, Queen of Scots, and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought, look wonderfully
a woman, and dignified. At twenty she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was full-breasted and luxuriously
formed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face was still like a soft rich mask, unchangeable. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes, once lifted, were wonderful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would
notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) new blouse.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), being in a hard, ironical mood, was entertaining the family to
a description of a service given in the Primitive Methodist Chapel,
conducted by one of the well-known preachers of the sect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat at
the head of the table, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mobile face, with the eyes that could be so
beautiful, shining with tenderness or dancing with laughter, now taking
on one expression and then another, in imitation of various people he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was mocking. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mockery always hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>); it was too near the reality.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was too clever and cruel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt that when his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes were like this,
hard with mocking hate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would spare neither himself nor anybody else.
But Mrs. Leivers was wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) eyes with laughter, and Mr. Leivers,
just awake from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) Sunday nap, was rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) head in amusement.
The three brothers sat with ruffled, sleepy appearance in their
shirt-sleeves, giving a guffaw from time to time. The whole family loved
a <div class="bookquote">``take-off''  (<font color='red'><b>The family</b></font>)</div>more than anything.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) took no notice of Miriam. Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) remark her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) new blouse,
saw that the artist approved, but it won from him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) not a spark of warmth.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was nervous, could hardly reach the teacups from the shelves.

<p/>When the men went out to milk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) ventured to address him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) personally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were late,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) answered.

<p/>There was silence for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it rough riding?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't notice it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) continued quickly to lay the table. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
had finished--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea won't be for a few minutes. Will you come and look at the
daffodils?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) rose without answering. They went out into the back garden under
the budding damson-trees. The hills and the sky were clean and cold.
Everything looked washed, rather hard. Miriam glanced at Paul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
pale and impassive. It seemed cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes and brows,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved, could look so hurting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has the wind made you tired?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) detected an underneath
feeling of weariness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be rough on the road--the wood moans so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can see by the clouds it's a south-west wind; that helps me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, I don't cycle, so I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there need to cycle to know that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sarcasms were unnecessary. They went forward in silence.
Round the wild, tussocky lawn at the back of the house was a thorn
hedge, under which daffodils were craning forward from among their
sheaves of grey-green blades. The cheeks of the flowers were greenish
with cold. But still some had burst, and their gold ruffled and glowed.
Miriam went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knees before one cluster, took a wild-looking
daffodil between her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands, turned up its face of gold to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and bowed
down, caressing it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth and cheeks and brow. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood aside,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pockets, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). One after another she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
turned up to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the faces of the yellow, bursten flowers appealingly,
fondling them lavishly all the while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't they magnificent?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Magnificent! It's a bit thick--they're pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bowed again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) flowers at his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) censure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) praise. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) watched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) crouching, sipping the flowers with fervid kisses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why must you always be fondling things?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said irritably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I love to touch them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied, hurt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you never like things without clutching them as if you wanted to
pull the heart out of them? Why don't you have a bit more restraint, or
reserve, or something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) full of pain, then continued slowly to stroke her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
lips against a ruffled flower. Their scent, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) smelled it, was so
much kinder than he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); it almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wheedle the soul out of things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I would never
wheedle--at any rate, I'd go straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) scarcely knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was saying. These things came from him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
mechanically. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) body seemed one weapon, firm and
hard against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're always begging things to love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as if you were a
beggar for love. Even the flowers, you have to fawn on them--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rhythmically, Miriam was swaying and stroking the flower with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth,
inhaling the scent which ever after made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shudder as it came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
nostrils.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want to love--your eternal and abnormal craving is to be
loved. You aren't positive, you're negative. You absorb, absorb, as
if you must fill yourself up with love, because you've got a shortage
somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was stunned by his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cruelty, and did not hear. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not the
faintest notion of what he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was saying. It was as if his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fretted,
tortured soul, run hot by thwarted passion, jetted off these sayings
like sparks from electricity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not grasp anything he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
only sat crouched beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cruelty and his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hatred of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) never
realised in a flash. Over everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brooded and brooded.

<p/>After tea he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stayed with Edgar and the brothers, taking no notice of
Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), extremely unhappy on this looked-for holiday, waited for
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). And at last he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) yielded and came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was determined to track
this mood of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to its origin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) counted it not much more than a
mood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go through the wood a little way?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
never refused a direct request.

<p/>They went down to the warren. On the middle path they passed a trap, a
narrow horseshoe hedge of small fir-boughs, baited with the guts of a
rabbit. Paul glanced at it frowning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it dreadful?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know! Is it worse than a weasel with its teeth in a rabbit's
throat? One weasel or many rabbits? One or the other must go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was taking the bitterness of life badly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was rather sorry for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go back to the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to walk out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went past the lilac-tree, whose bronze leaf-buds were coming
unfastened. Just a fragment remained of the haystack, a monument squared
and brown, like a pillar of stone. There was a little bed of hay from
the last cutting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us sit here a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat down against his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) will, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) back against the hard wall of
hay. They faced the amphitheatre of round hills that glowed with sunset,
tiny white farms standing out, the meadows golden, the woods dark and
yet luminous, tree-tops folded over tree-tops, distinct in the distance.
The evening had cleared, and the east was tender with a magenta flush
under which the land lay still and rich.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) only scowled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would rather have had it ugly just then.

<p/>At that moment a big bull-terrier came rushing up, open-mouthed, pranced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) two paws on the youth's shoulders, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face. Paul drew back,
laughing. Bill was a great relief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) pushed the dog aside, but
it came leaping back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad, <div class="bookquote">``or I'll dot thee one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>But the dog was not to be pushed away. So Paul had a little battle
with the creature, pitching poor Bill away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), who, however,
only floundered tumultuously back again, wild with joy. The two fought
together, the man laughing grudgingly, the dog grinning all over. Miriam
watched them. There was something pathetic about the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted so
badly to love, to be tender. The rough way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowled the dog over was
really loving. Bill got up, panting with happiness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) brown eyes
rolling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) white face, and lumbered back again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) adored Paul. The
lad frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bill, I've had enough o' thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) said.

<p/>But the dog only stood with two heavy paws, that quivered with love,
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) thigh, and flickered a red tongue at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) drew back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``no--I've had enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And in a minute the dog trotted off happily, to vary the fun.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) remained staring miserably across at the hills, whose still beauty
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) begrudged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) wanted to go and cycle with Edgar. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had not the
courage to leave Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you sad?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked humbly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sad; why should I be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I'm only normal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) always claimed to be normal when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was
disagreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pleaded, coaxing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) soothingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) picked up a stick and began to stab the earth with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd far better not talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wish to know--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) laughed resentfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You always do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not fair to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) thrust, thrust, thrust at the ground with the pointed stick, digging
up little clods of earth as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) were in a fever of irritation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
gently and firmly laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) band on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) wrist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Put it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) flung the stick into the currant-bushes, and leaned back. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was
bottled up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pleaded softly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) lay perfectly still, only his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) eyes alive, and they full of torment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said at length, rather wearily--<div class="bookquote">``you know--we'd better
break off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dreaded. Swiftly everything seemed to darken before her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``What has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing has happened. We only realise where we are. It's no good--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) waited in silence, sadly, patiently. It was no good being impatient
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) now what ailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We agreed on friendship,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) went on in a dull, monotonous voice. <div class="bookquote">``How
often HAVE we agreed for friendship! And yet--it neither stops there,
nor gets anywhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was silent again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brooded. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) mean? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was so wearying.
There was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would not yield. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) must be patient with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only give friendship--it's all I'm capable of--it's a flaw in my
make-up. The thing overbalances to one side--I hate a toppling balance.
Let us have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was warmth of fury in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) last phrases. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) meant she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) could not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had not
in herself that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) wanted. It was the deepest motive of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
soul, this self-mistrust. It was so deep she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dared neither realise nor
acknowledge. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was deficient. Like an infinitely subtle shame,
it kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) always back. If it were so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
would never let herself want him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would merely see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing--it's all in myself--it only comes out just now. We're always
like this towards Easter-time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) grovelled so helplessly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). At least she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) never
floundered in such a pitiable way. After all, it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) who was chiefly
humiliated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--I mustn't come often--that's all. Why should I monopolise you when
I'm not--You see, I'm deficient in something with regard to you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and so ought to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) a
chance with another man. How foolish and blind and shamefully clumsy he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was! What were other men to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)! What were men to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) at all! But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
ah! she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul. Was HE (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deficient in something? Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said huskily. <div class="bookquote">``Yesterday--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The night was turning jangled and hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as the twilight faded.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bowed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) suffering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you never will! You'll never believe that I
can't--can't physically, any more than I can fly up like a skylark--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dreaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bitterly at that moment because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) suffer. Love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). This about not
loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), physically, bodily, was a mere perversity on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was stupid like a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belonged
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) guessed somebody had been influencing
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the hardness, the foreignness of another
influence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have they been saying at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.

<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) despised them for their commonness, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
people. They did not know what things were really worth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) talked very little more that night. After all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to
cycle with Edgar.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother. Hers was the strongest tie in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought round, Miriam shrank away. There was a vague, unreal
feel about her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). And nobody else mattered. There was one place in the
world that stood solid and did not melt into unreality: the place where
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother was. Everybody else could grow shadowy, almost non-existent
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not. It was as if the pivot and pole of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life,
from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not escape, was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.

<p/>And in the same way she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). In him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was established her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life
now. After all, the life beyond offered very little to Mrs. Morel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
saw that our chance for DOING is here, and doing counted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Paul
was going to prove that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had been right; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was going to make a man
whom nothing should shift off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was going to alter the face
of the earth in some way which mattered. Wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
soul went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soul stood by him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
ready, as it were, to hand him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tools. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not bear it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was with Miriam. William was dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would fight to keep Paul.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). And in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul was a feeling of the
satisfaction of self-sacrifice because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) first; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) first. And yet it was not enough. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) new young
life, so strong and imperious, was urged towards something else. It made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mad with restlessness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw this, and wished bitterly that Miriam
had been a woman who could take this new life of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) the
roots. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fought against his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother almost as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fought against Miriam.

<p/>It was a week before he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went again to Willey Farm. Miriam had suffered
a great deal, and was afraid to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) again. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) now to endure
the ignominy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) abandoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)? That would only be superficial
and temporary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would come back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) held the keys to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul. But
meanwhile, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would torture her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) battle against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
shrank from it.

<p/>However, the Sunday after Easter he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came to tea. Mrs. Leivers was glad
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) gathered something was fretting him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found
things hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed to drift to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) for comfort. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) was good
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) did him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that great kindness of treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) almost with
reverence.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) with the young children in the front garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you've come,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) great
appealing brown eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It is such a sunny day. I was just going down the
fields for the first time this year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to come. That soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). They went, talking
simply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gentle and humble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could have wept with gratitude that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was deferential to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was feeling humiliated.

<p/>At the bottom of the Mow Close they found a thrush's nest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I show you the eggs?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Leivers. <div class="bookquote">``They seem SUCH a sign of spring, and so
hopeful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put aside the thorns, and took out the eggs, holding them in the palm
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are quite hot--I think we frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) off them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Leivers.

<p/>Miriam could not help touching the eggs, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand which, it seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), cradled them so well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it a strange warmth!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured, to get near him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blood heat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) putting them back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) body pressed against the hedge,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arm reaching slowly through the thorns, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand folded carefully
over the eggs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was concentrated on the act. Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed so simple and sufficient to himself. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not
get to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>After tea she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood hesitating at the bookshelf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took <div class="bookquote">``Tartarin de
Tarascon'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>. Again they sat on the bank of hay at the foot of the stack.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) read a couple of pages, but without any heart for it. Again the dog
came racing up to repeat the fun of the other day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoved his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) muzzle
in the man's chest. Paul fingered his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ear for a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pushed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, Bill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Hodgkisson</b></font>)</div><p/>Bill slunk off, and Miriam wondered and dreaded what was coming. There
was a silence about the youth that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) still with apprehension. It
was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) furies, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) quiet resolutions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) feared.

<p/>Turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) face a little to one side, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)
began, speaking slowly and painfully:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think--if I didn't come up so much--you might get to like
somebody else--another man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So this was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was still harping on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't know any other men. Why do you ask?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied, in a low
tone that should have been a reproach to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) blurted, <div class="bookquote">``because they say I've no right to come up like
this--without we mean to marry--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam was indignant at anybody's forcing the issues between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
had been furious with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) own father for suggesting to Paul, laughingly,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came so much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who says?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked, wondering if her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) people had anything to do with
it. They had not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother--and the others. They say at this rate everybody will consider
me engaged, and I ought to consider myself so, because it's not fair to
you. And I've tried to find out--and I don't think I love you as a man
ought to love his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. What do you think about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head moodily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was angry at having this struggle.
People should leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think we love each other enough to marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked definitely.
It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) tremble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered truthfully. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think so--we're too young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went on miserably, <div class="bookquote">``that you, with your
intensity in things, might have given me more--than I could ever make up
to you. And even now--if you think it better--we'll be engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Miriam wanted to cry. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was angry, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was always such a
child for people to do as they liked with.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said firmly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pondered a minute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``with me--I don't think one person would ever
monopolize me--be everything to me--I think never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not consider.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured. Then, after a pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark
eyes flashed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never liked me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, it isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said hastily. <div class="bookquote">``It was for your sake she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke
this time. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only said, if I was going on, I ought to consider myself
engaged.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a silence. <div class="bookquote">``And if I ask you to come down any time,
you won't stop away, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not answer. By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was very angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said shortly. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I'd better drop
French. I was just beginning to get on with it. But I suppose I can go
on alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that we need,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can give you a French lesson,
surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--and there are Sunday nights. I shan't stop coming to chapel,
because I enjoy it, and it's all the social life I get. But you've no
need to come home with me. I can go alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered, rather taken aback. <div class="bookquote">``But if I ask Edgar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)'ll
always come with us, and then they can say nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence. After all, then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would not lose much. For all
their talk down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) home there would not be much difference. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
wished they would mind their own business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you won't think about it, and let it trouble you, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>replied Miriam, without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) unstable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had no fixity of purpose, no
anchor of righteousness that held him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``a man gets across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bicycle--and goes to
work--and does all sorts of things. But a woman broods.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't bother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) meant it.

<p/>It had gone rather chilly. They went indoors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How white Paul looks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Leivers exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Miriam, you shouldn't
have let him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sit out of doors. Do you think you've taken cold, Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt done up. It wore him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) out, the conflict in himself. Miriam
pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) now. But quite early, before nine o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not going home, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Leivers anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I said I'd be early.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was very awkward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this IS early,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Leivers.

<p/>Miriam sat in the rocking-chair, and did not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hesitated,
expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to rise and go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to the barn as usual for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
bicycle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) remained as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was at a loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--good-night, all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) faltered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) good-night along with all the others. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went past
the window he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brows knit slightly in a
way that had become constant with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes dark with pain.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rose and went to the doorway to wave good-bye to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) passed
through the gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rode slowly under the pine-trees, feeling a cur and
a miserable wretch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle went tilting down the hills at random.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought it would be a relief to break one's neck.

<p/>Two days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) up a book and a little note, urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to
read and be busy.

<p/>At this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) friendship to Edgar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved the family
so much, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved the farm so much; it was the dearest place on earth to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) home was not so lovable. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would
have been just as happy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother anywhere. Whereas Willey Farm he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>)
loved passionately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) loved the little pokey kitchen, where men's boots
tramped, and the dog slept with one eye open for fear of being trodden
on; where the lamp hung over the table at night, and everything was
so silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) loved Miriam's long, low parlour, with its atmosphere of
romance, its flowers, its books, its high rosewood piano. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) loved the
gardens and the buildings that stood with their scarlet roofs on the
naked edges of the fields, crept towards the wood as if for cosiness,
the wild country scooping down a valley and up the uncultured hills of
the other side. Only to be there was an exhilaration and a joy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) loved Mrs. Leivers, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) unworldliness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) quaint cynicism;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) loved Mr. Leivers, so warm and young and lovable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) loved Edgar, who
lit up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) came, and the boys and the children and Bill--even the
sow Circe and the Indian game-cock called Tippoo. All this besides
Miriam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) could not give it up.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) went as often, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was usually with Edgar. Only all the family,
including the father, joined in charades and games at evening. And
later, Miriam drew them together, and they read Macbeth out of penny
books, taking parts. It was great excitement. Miriam was glad, and Mrs.
Leivers was glad, and Mr. Leivers enjoyed it. Then they all learned
songs together from tonic sol-fa, singing in a circle round the fire.
But now Paul was very rarely alone with Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) waited. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
and Edgar and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) walked home together from chapel or from the literary
society in Bestwood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) talk, so passionate and so unorthodox
nowadays, was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did envy Edgar, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) cycling with
Paul, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) Friday nights, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) days working in the fields. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) Friday
nights and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) French lessons were gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was nearly always alone,
walking, pondering in the wood, reading, studying, dreaming, waiting.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) frequently.

<p/>One Sunday evening they attained to their old rare harmony. Edgar had
stayed to Communion--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) wondered what it was like--with Mrs. Morel. So
Paul came on alone with Miriam to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was more or less under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) spell again. As usual, they were discussing the sermon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
setting now full sail towards Agnosticism, but such a religious
Agnosticism that Miriam did not suffer so badly. They were at the Renan
Vie de Jesus stage. Miriam was the threshing-floor on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) threshed
out all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) beliefs. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) trampled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) ideas upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul, the
truth came out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) alone was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) threshing-floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) alone
helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) towards realization. Almost impassive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) submitted to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) argument and expounding. And somehow, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) gradually
realized where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was wrong. And what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) realized, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) realized. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) could not do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>They came to the silent house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) took the key out of the scullery
window, and they entered. All the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) discussion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) lit the gas, mended the fire, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) some cakes from the
pantry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sat on the sofa, quietly, with a plate on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wore
a large white hat with some pinkish flowers. It was a cheap hat, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) liked it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face beneath was still and pensive, golden-brown and
ruddy. Always her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) ears were hid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) short curls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) on Sundays. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) wore a dark suit that showed the lithe
movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) body. There was a clean, clear-cut look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) thinking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) reached for a Bible.
Miriam liked the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) reached up--so sharp, straight to the mark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
turned the pages quickly, and read her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) a chapter of St. John. As he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat
in the armchair reading, intent, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice only thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) were using her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) unconsciously as a man uses his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tools at some work he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is bent on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved it. And the wistfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was like a
reaching to something, and it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) were what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached with.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sat back on the sofa away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and yet feeling herself the very
instrument his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand grasped. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) great pleasure.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to falter and to get self-conscious. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to
the verse, <div class="bookquote">``A woman, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is in travail, hath sorrow because
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hour is come'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) missed it out. Miriam had felt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) growing
uncomfortable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shrank when the well-known words did not follow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
went on reading, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not hear. A grief and shame made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bend
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head. Six months ago he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have read it simply. Now there was a
scotch in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) running with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt there was really something
hostile between them, something of which they were ashamed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cake mechanically. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) argument, but
could not get back the right note. Soon Edgar came in. Mrs. Morel had
gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) friends'. The three set off to Willey Farm.

<p/>Miriam brooded over his (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) split with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). There was something else he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>)
wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) could not be satisfied; he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) no peace. There was
between them now always a ground for strife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted to prove him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) chief need in life was herself. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could prove
it, both to herself and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>), the rest might go; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could simply
trust to the future.

<p/>So in May she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) to come to Willey Farm and meet Mrs. Dawes.
There was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) hankered after. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>), whenever they spoke
of Clara Dawes, rouse and get slightly angry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) did not like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) was keen to know about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) should put himself to
the test. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) believed that there were in him (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) desires for higher things,
and desires for lower, and that the desire for the higher would conquer.
At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) should try. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) forgot that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``higher''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``lower''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>were arbitrary.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Farm</b></font>) was rather excited at the idea of meeting Clara at Willey Farm. Mrs.
Dawes came for the day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) heavy, dun-coloured hair was coiled on
top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) wore a white blouse and navy skirt, and somehow,
wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was, seemed to make things look paltry and insignificant.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was in the room, the kitchen seemed too small and mean
altogether. Miriam's beautiful twilighty parlour looked stiff and
stupid. All the Leivers were eclipsed like candles. They found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rather hard to put up with. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was perfectly amiable, but
indifferent, and rather hard.

<p/>Paul did not come till afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was early. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) swung off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
bicycle, Miriam saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) look round at the house eagerly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would be
disappointed if the visitor had not come. Miriam went out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
bowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head because of the sunshine. Nasturtiums were coming out
crimson under the cool green shadow of their leaves. The girl stood,
dark-haired, glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't Clara come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>replied Miriam in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) musical tone. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'s reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle into the barn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had put on a handsome tie, of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was rather proud, and socks to match.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) came this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>replied Miriam, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) walked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``You said you'd bring
me that letter from the man at Liberty's. Have you remembered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dash, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But nag at me till you get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to nag at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do it whether or not. And is she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) any more agreeable?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I always think she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is quite agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was silent. Evidently his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eagerness to be early to-day had been the
newcomer. Miriam already began to suffer. They went together towards the
house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took the clips off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) trousers, but was too lazy to brush the
dust from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoes, in spite of the socks and tie.

<p/>Clara sat in the cool parlour reading. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw the nape of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) white
neck, and the fine hair lifted from it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) rose, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
indifferently. To shake hands she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm straight, in a
manner that seemed at once to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) at a distance, and yet to fling
something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) noticed how her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breasts swelled inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) blouse,
and how her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shoulder curved handsomely under the thin muslin at the top
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have chosen a fine day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It happens so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I am glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sat down, not thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) politeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing all morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul of Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam, coughing huskily, <div class="bookquote">``Clara only came with
father--and so--she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'s not been here very long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara sat leaning on the table, holding aloof. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands were
large, but well kept. And the skin on them seemed almost coarse, opaque,
and white, with fine golden hairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not mind if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) intended to scorn him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heavy arm lay negligently on the
table. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth was closed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) were offended, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
face slightly averted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were at Margaret Bonford's meeting the other evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>Miriam did not know this courteous Paul. Clara glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>asked Miriam, <div class="bookquote">``how do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I went in for a few minutes before the train came,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Clara turned away again rather disdainfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>)'s a lovable little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret Bonford!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Clara. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>)'s a great deal cleverer than
most men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I didn't say she (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) wasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, deprecating. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>)'s lovable
for all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, of course, that is all that matters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara witheringly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head, rather perplexed, rather annoyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it matters more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) cleverness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``which, after
all, would never get her (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) to heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not heaven she (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) wants to get--it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) fair share on earth,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>retorted Clara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) spoke as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were responsible for some deprivation
which Miss Bonford suffered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) was warm, and awfully nice--only too
frail. I wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) was sitting comfortably in peace--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Darning her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) husband's stockings,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara scathingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) wouldn't mind darning even my stockings,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And
I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>)'d do them well. Just as I wouldn't mind blacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) boots
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bonford</b></font>) wanted me to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>But Clara refused to answer this sally of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talked to Miriam for a
little while. The other woman held aloof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I think I'll go and see Edgar. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) on the land?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)'s gone for a load of coal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) should be
back directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam dared not propose anything for the three of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose and
left them.

<p/>On the top road, where the gorse was out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw Edgar walking lazily
beside the mare, who nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) white-starred forehead as she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) dragged
the clanking load of coal. The young farmer's face lighted up as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) saw
his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) friend. Edgar was good-looking, with dark, warm eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) clothes
were old and rather disreputable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) walked with considerable pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said, seeing Paul bareheaded. <div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Came to meet you. Can't stand `Nevermore.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div><p/>Edgar's teeth flashed in a laugh of amusement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is `Nevermore'?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady--Mrs. Dawes--it ought to be Mrs. The Raven that quothed
`Nevermore.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div><p/>Edgar laughed with glee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a fat lot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``Why, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The answer came with a deep ring of conviction. <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>Edgar pursed
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``I can't say she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)'s much in my line.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) mused a little.
Then: <div class="bookquote">``But why do you call her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) `Nevermore'?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, ``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) looks at a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) says haughtily
``Nevermore,'' and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) looks at herself in the looking-glass she (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) says
disdainfully ``Nevermore,<div class="bookquote">'' and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) thinks back she (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) says it in disgust,
and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) looks forward she (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) says it cynically.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Edgar considered this speech, failed to make much out of it, and said,
laughing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)'s a man-hater?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SHE thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) nice with you, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) NICE with anybody?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man.

<p/>Edgar laughed. Together they unloaded the coal in the yard. Paul was
rather self-conscious, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew Clara could see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked out
of the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) didn't look.

<p/>On Saturday afternoons the horses were brushed down and groomed. Paul
and Edgar worked together, sneezing with the dust that came from the
pelts of Jimmy and Flower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know a new song to teach me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>said Edgar.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) continued to work all the time. The back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) neck was sun-red
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) bent down, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) fingers that held the brush were thick. Paul
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sometimes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Mary Morrison'?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>suggested the younger.

<p/>Edgar agreed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had a good tenor voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) loved to learn all the
songs his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) friend could teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) could sing whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was
carting. Paul had a very indifferent baritone voice, but a good ear.
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sang softly, for fear of Clara. Edgar repeated the line in a
clear tenor. At times they both broke off to sneeze, and first one, then
the other, abused his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) horse.

<p/>Miriam was impatient of men. It took so little to amuse them--even Paul.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought it anomalous in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could be so thoroughly absorbed
in a triviality.

<p/>It was tea-time when they had finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What song was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>asked Miriam.

<p/>Edgar told her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). The conversation turned to singing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have such jolly times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>Miriam said to Clara.

<p/>Mrs. Dawes ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) meal in a slow, dignified way. Whenever the men were
present she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) grew distant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like singing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>Miriam asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>Paul, of course, coloured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean if it is high-class and trained?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think a voice needs training before the singing is anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might as well insist on having people's voices trained before you
allowed them to talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Really, people sing for their own
pleasure, as a rule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it may be for other people's discomfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the other people should have flaps to their ears,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/>The boys laughed. There was a silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flushed deeply, and ate in
silence.

<p/>After tea, when all the men had gone but Paul, Mrs. Leivers said to
Clara:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you find life happier now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Infinitely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are satisfied?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as I can be free and independent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't MISS anything in your life?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Leivers</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Leivers gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've put all that behind me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul had been feeling uncomfortable during this discourse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find you're always tumbling over the things you've put behind
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) departure to the cowsheds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had been witty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) manly pride was high. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whistled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went
down the brick track.

<p/>Miriam came for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a little later to know if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would go with Clara and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) for a walk. They set off down to Strelley Mill Farm. As they were
going beside the brook, on the Willey Water side, looking through the
brake at the edge of the wood, where pink campions glowed under a few
sunbeams, they saw, beyond the tree-trunks and the thin hazel bushes,
a man leading a great bay horse through the gullies. The big red beast
seemed to dance romantically through that dimness of green hazel drift,
away there where the air was shadowy, as if it were in the past, among
the fading bluebells that might have bloomed for Deidre or Iseult.

<p/>The three stood charmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a treat to be a knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and to have a pavilion here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to have us shut up safely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, ``singing with your maids at your broidery. I would
carry your banner of white and green and heliotrope. I would have
``W.S.P.U.<div class="bookquote">'' emblazoned on my shield, beneath a woman rampant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara, <div class="bookquote">``that you would much rather fight for a
woman than let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fight for herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fights for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seems like a dog before a
looking-glass, gone into a mad fury with its own shadow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And YOU are the looking-glass?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked, with a curl of the lip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or the shadow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that you are too clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I leave it to you to be GOOD,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) retorted, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Be good,
sweet maid, and just let ME be clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>But Clara wearied of his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) flippancy. Suddenly, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) saw
that the upward lifting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face was misery and not scorn. His (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heart
grew tender for everybody. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) turned and was gentle with Miriam, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
had neglected till then.

<p/>At the wood's edge they met Limb, a thin, swarthy man of forty, tenant
of Strelley Mill, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran as a cattle-raising farm. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held the
halter of the powerful stallion indifferently, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were tired. The
three stood to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pass over the stepping-stones of the first brook.
Paul admired that so large an animal should walk on such springy toes,
with an endless excess of vigour. Limb pulled up before them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell your father, Miss Leivers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, in a peculiar piping voice,
<div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) young beas`es `as broke that bottom fence three days an'
runnin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>asked Miriam, tremulous.

<p/>The great horse breathed heavily, shifting round its red flanks, and
looking suspiciously with its wonderful big eyes upwards from under its
lowered head and falling mane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Limb, <div class="bookquote">``an' I'll show you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man stallion</b></font>)</div><p/>The man and the stallion went forward. It danced sideways, shaking its
white fetlocks and looking frightened, as it felt itself in the brook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No hanky-pankyin',''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man affectionately to the beast.

<p/>It went up the bank in little leaps, then splashed finely through the
second brook. Clara, walking with a kind of sulky abandon, watched it
half-fascinated, half-contemptuous. Limb stopped and pointed to the
fence under some willows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you see where they got through,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My man's druv 'em
back three times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>answered Miriam, colouring as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) were at fault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you comin' in?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thanks; but we should like to go by the pond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, just as you've a mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>The horse gave little whinneys of pleasure at being so near home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is glad to be back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara, who was interested in the creature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--`e's been a tidy step to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>They went through the gate, and saw approaching them from the
big farmhouse a smallish, dark, excitable-looking woman of about
thirty-five. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was touched with grey, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dark eyes looked wild.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother went forward. As
it saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), the big bay stallion whinneyed again. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came up excitedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you home again, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said tenderly to the horse, not to
the man. The great beast shifted round to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), ducking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
smuggled into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth the wrinkled yellow apple she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been hiding
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back, then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) near the eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave a big sigh
of pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>Miss Limb looked up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark eyes glanced straight at Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, good-evening, Miss Leivers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's ages since you've been
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your horse IS a fine fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``As loving as any man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More loving than most men, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a nice boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cried the woman, again embracing the horse.

<p/>Clara, fascinated by the big beast, went up to stroke his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s quite gentle,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Limb. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think big fellows are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a beauty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Clara.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can--all but,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the other woman.

<p/>Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) brother moved on with the horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you coming in? DO come in, Mr.--I didn't catch it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam. <div class="bookquote">``No, we won't come in, but we should like to go by
the mill-pond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes, do. Do you fish, Mr. Morel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because if you do you might come and fish any time,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Limb.
<div class="bookquote">``We scarcely see a soul from week's end to week's end. I should be
thankful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What fish are there in the pond?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>They went through the front garden, over the sluice, and up the steep
bank to the pond, which lay in shadow, with its two wooded islets. Paul
walked with Miss Limb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind swimming here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Come when you like. My brother will be awfully
pleased to talk with you. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is so quiet, because there is no one to
talk to. Do come and swim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara came up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a fine depth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and so clear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Limb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you swim?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Limb was just saying we could come when
we liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course there's the farm-hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Limb.

<p/>They talked a few moments, then went on up the wild hill, leaving the
lonely, haggard-eyed woman on the bank.

<p/>The hillside was all ripe with sunshine. It was wild and tussocky, given
over to rabbits. The three walked in silence. Then:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) makes me feel uncomfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean Miss Limb?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>asked Miriam. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) going dotty with being too lonely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam. <div class="bookquote">``It's not the right sort of life for her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>). I think
it's cruel to bury her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) there. I really ought to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) more.
But--she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) upsets me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) makes me feel sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)--yes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) bothers me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>blurted Clara suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) wants a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>The other two were silent for a few moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's the loneliness sends her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) cracked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Clara did not answer, but strode on uphill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
hand hanging, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) legs swinging as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) kicked through the dead thistles
and the tussocky grass, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms hanging loose. Rather than walking, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
handsome body seemed to be blundering up the hill. A hot wave went over
Paul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was curious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Perhaps life had been cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
forgot Miriam, who was walking beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) glanced at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), finding he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes were fixed ahead on Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you still think she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is disagreeable?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not notice that the question was sudden. It ran with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something's the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>answered Miriam.

<p/>They found at the top of the hill a hidden wild field, two sides of
which were backed by the wood, the other sides by high loose hedges of
hawthorn and elder bushes. Between these overgrown bushes were gaps
that the cattle might have walked through had there been any cattle now.
There the turf was smooth as velveteen, padded and holed by the rabbits.
The field itself was coarse, and crowded with tall, big cowslips that
had never been cut. Clusters of strong flowers rose everywhere above the
coarse tussocks of bent. It was like a roadstead crowded with tan, fairy
shipping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>cried Miriam, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at Paul, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark eyes dilating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
smiled. Together they enjoyed the field of flowers. Clara, a little way
off, was looking at the cowslips disconsolately. Paul and Miriam stayed
close together, talking in subdued tones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kneeled on one knee,
quickly gathering the best blossoms, moving from tuft to tuft
restlessly, talking softly all the time. Miriam plucked the flowers
lovingly, lingering over them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) always seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) too quick and
almost scientific. Yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bunches had a natural beauty more than hers.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved them, but as if they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a right to them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
had more reverence for them: they held something she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had not.

<p/>The flowers were very fresh and sweet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to drink them. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gathered them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ate the little yellow trumpets. Clara was still
wandering about disconsolately. Going towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you get some?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe in it. They look better growing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'd like some?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They want to be left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe they do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want the corpses of flowers about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a stiff, artificial notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They don't die any
quicker in water than on their roots. And besides, they LOOK nice in
a bowl--they look jolly. And you only call a thing a corpse because it
looks corpse-like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether it is one or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) argued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't one to me. A dead flower isn't a corpse of a flower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara now ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And even so--what right have you to pull them?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I like them, and want them--and there's plenty of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is sufficient?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Why not? I'm sure they'd smell nice in your room in Nottingham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I should have the pleasure of watching them die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then--it does not matter if they do die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and went stooping over the clumps of tangled
flowers which thickly sprinkled the field like pale, luminous
foam-clots. Miriam had come close. Clara was kneeling, breathing some
scent from the cowslips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam, <div class="bookquote">``if you treat them with reverence you don't do
them any harm. It is the spirit you pluck them in that matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But no, you get 'em because you want 'em, and that's
all.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bunch.

<p/>Miriam was silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) picked some more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at these!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``sturdy and lusty like little trees and
like boys with fat legs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara's hat lay on the grass not far off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was kneeling, bending
forward still to smell the flowers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) neck gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a sharp pang, such
a beautiful thing, yet not proud of itself just now. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breasts swung
slightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) blouse. The arching curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) back was beautiful and
strong; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wore no stays. Suddenly, without knowing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was scattering
a handful of cowslips over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hair and neck, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust,
If the Lord won't have you the devil must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a handful</b></font>)</div><p/>The chill flowers fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), with almost
pitiful, scared grey eyes, wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was doing. Flowers fell on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Suddenly, standing there above her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt awkward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you wanted a funeral,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, ill at ease.

<p/>Clara laughed strangely, and rose, picking the cowslips from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hair.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hat and pinned it on. One flower had remained tangled in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw, but would not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gathered up the flowers he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had sprinkled over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/>At the edge of the wood the bluebells had flowed over into the field and
stood there like flood-water. But they were fading now. Clara strayed up
to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wandered after her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). The bluebells pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look how they've come out of the wood!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned with a flash of warmth and of gratitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) smiled.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood beat up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me think of the wild men of the woods, how terrified they
would be when they got breast to breast with the open space.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think they were?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder which was more frightened among old tribes--those bursting out
of their darkness of woods upon all the space of light, or those from
the open tiptoeing into the forests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think the second,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you DO feel like one of the open space sort, trying to force
yourself into the dark, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered queerly.

<p/>The conversation ended there.

<p/>The evening was deepening over the earth. Already the valley was full of
shadow. One tiny square of light stood opposite at Crossleigh Bank Farm.
Brightness was swimming on the tops of the hills. Miriam came up slowly,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) big, loose bunch of flowers, walking ankle-deep through
the scattered froth of the cowslips. Beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) the trees were coming
into shape, all shadow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/>And the three turned away. They were all silent. Going down the path
they could see the light of home right across, and on the ridge of the
hill a thin dark outline with little lights, where the colliery village
touched the sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been nice, hasn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Miriam murmured assent. Clara was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) persisted.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head up, and still did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could tell
by the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) moved, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) didn't care, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) suffered.

<p/>At this time Paul took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother to Lincoln. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was bright and
enthusiastic as ever, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in the railway
carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) seemed to look frail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a momentary sensation as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) were slipping away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to get hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), to
fasten her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), almost to chain her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) must keep hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand.

<p/>They drew near to the city. Both were at the window looking for the
cathedral.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried.

<p/>They saw the great cathedral lying couchant above the plain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) blue eyes were watching the cathedral
quietly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) seemed again to be beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Something in the eternal
repose of the uplifted cathedral, blue and noble against the sky, was
reflected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), something of the fatality. What was, WAS. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
young will he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not alter it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face, the skin still fresh
and pink and downy, but crow's-feet near her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyelids steady,
sinking a little, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mouth always closed with disillusion; and there
was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) the same eternal look, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew fate at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) beat
against it with all the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, mother, how big she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is above the town! Think, there are streets
and streets below her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looks bigger than the city altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, breaking bright into life again.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sitting, looking steady out of the window at the
cathedral, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face and eyes fixed, reflecting the relentlessness of
life. And the crow's-feet near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth shut so hard,
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would go mad.

<p/>They ate a meal that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) considered wildly extravagant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't imagine I like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cutlet. ``I DON<div class="bookquote">``T
like it, I really don't! Just THINK of your money wasted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never mind my money,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You forget I'm a fellow taking his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
girl for an outing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) some blue violets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop it at once, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) commanded. <div class="bookquote">``How can I do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got nothing to do. Stand still!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And in the middle of High Street he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stuck the flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An old thing like me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, sniffing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I want people to think we're awful swells. So look
ikey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll jowl your head,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strut!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) commanded. <div class="bookquote">``Be a fantail pigeon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) an hour to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) through the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood above Glory
Hole, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood before Stone Bow, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood everywhere, and exclaimed.

<p/>A man came up, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, and bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I show you the town, madam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I've got my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Paul was cross with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for not answering with more dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You go away with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Ha! that's the Jew's House. Now,
do you remember that lecture, Paul--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could scarcely climb the cathedral hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not notice.
Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unable to speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into a little
public-house, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My heart is only a bit old; one must expect
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not answer, but looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Again his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart was crushed in a
hot grip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to cry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to smash things in fury.

<p/>They set off again, pace by pace, so slowly. And every step seemed like
a weight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart would burst. At last
they came to the top. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood enchanted, looking at the castle gate,
looking at the cathedral front. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had quite forgotten herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now THIS is better than I thought it could be!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated it. Everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), brooding. They sat together
in the cathedral. They attended a little service in the choir. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
timid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is open to anybody?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think they'd have the damned cheek to send us
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``they would if they heard your
language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face seemed to shine again with joy and peace during the service.
And all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was wanting to rage and smash things and cry.

<p/>Afterwards, when they were leaning over the wall, looking at the town
below, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blurted suddenly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't a man have a YOUNG mother? What is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother laughed, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can scarcely help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why wasn't I the oldest son? Look--they say the young ones have the
advantage--but look, THEY had the young mother. You should have had me
for your eldest son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't arrange it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remonstrated. <div class="bookquote">``Come to consider, you're as
much to blame as me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), white, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes furious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you old for!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, mad with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) impotence. <div class="bookquote">``WHY can't you
walk? WHY can't you come with me to places?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At one time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I could have run up that hill a good deal
better than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of that to ME?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried, hitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fist on the wall.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) became plaintive. <div class="bookquote">``It's too bad of you to be ill. Little, it
is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ill!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a bit old, and you'll have to put up with it,
that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were quiet. But it was as much as they could bear. They got jolly
again over tea. As they sat by Brayford, watching the boats, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
about Clara. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) innumerable questions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then who does she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) live with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother, on Bluebell Hill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have they enough to keep them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so. I think they do lace work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And wherein lies her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) charm, my boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s charming, mother. But she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s nice. And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seems
straight, you know--not a bit deep, not a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s a good deal older than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s thirty, I'm going on twenty-three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't told me what you like her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I don't know--a sort of defiant way she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s got--a sort of angry
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel considered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would have been glad now for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son to fall
in love with some woman who would--she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not know what. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fretted
so, got so furious suddenly, and again was melancholic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
knew some nice woman--She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wished, but left it
vague. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was not hostile to the idea of Clara.

<p/>Annie, too, was getting married. Leonard had gone away to work in
Birmingham. One week-end when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was home she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't look very well, my lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I feel anyhow or nohow, ma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``ma''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>already in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) boyish fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure they're good lodgings?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes. Only--it's a winder when you have to pour your own tea
out--an' nobody to grouse if you team it in your saucer and sup it up.
It somehow takes a' the taste out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so it knocks you up?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno. I want to get married,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) blurted, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) fingers and
looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) boots. There was a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I thought you said you'd wait another year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) replied stubbornly.

<p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) considered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Annie's a bit of a spendthrift. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'s saved
no more than eleven pounds. And I know, lad, you haven't had much
chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) coloured up to the ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got thirty-three quid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't go far,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said nothing, but twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've nothing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want, ma!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) cried, very red, suffering and remonstrating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my lad, I know. I was only wishing I had. And take away five pounds
for the wedding and things--it leaves twenty-nine pounds. You won't do
much on that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) twisted still, impotent, stubborn, not looking up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you really want to get married?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Do you feel as if
you ought?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) one straight look from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) blue eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``we must all do the best we can for it, lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) looked up there were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want Annie to feel handicapped,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said, struggling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you're steady--you've got a decent place. If a man
had NEEDED me I'd have married him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last week's wages. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) may
find it a bit hard to start humbly. Young girls ARE like that. They look
forward to the fine home they think they'll have. But I had expensive
furniture. It's not everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So the wedding took place almost immediately. Arthur came home, and was
splendid in uniform. Annie looked nice in a dove-grey dress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
could take for Sundays. Morel called her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) a fool for getting married, and
was cool with his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) son-in-law. Mrs. Morel had white tips in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bonnet,
and some white on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) blouse, and was teased by both her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sons for
fancying herself so grand. Leonard was jolly and cordial, and felt a
fearful fool. Paul could not quite see what Annie wanted to get
married for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hoped rather
lugubriously that it would turn out all right. Arthur was astonishingly
handsome in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) scarlet and yellow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knew it well, but was
secretly ashamed of the uniform. Annie cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) eyes up in the kitchen,
on leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother. Mrs. Morel cried a little, then patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) on the
back and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't cry, child, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be good to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel stamped and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was a fool to go and tie herself up. Leonard
looked white and overwrought. Mrs. Morel said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) to you, my lad, and hold you responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said, nearly dead with the ordeal. And it was all over.

<p/>When Morel and Arthur were in bed, Paul sat talking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) often did,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'s married, mother, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'s married--but--it seems strange that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) should go
from me. It even seems to me hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) can prefer to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
Leonard. That's how mothers are--I know it's silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall you be miserable about her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I think of my own wedding day,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother answered, <div class="bookquote">``I can only
hope her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) life will be different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) to be good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)'s not good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). But I say if a man
is GENUINE, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, and a girl is fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--then--it should be all
right. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you don't mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would NEVER have let a daughter of mine marry a man I didn't FEEL to
be genuine through and through. And yet, there's a gap now she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both miserable, and wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back again. It seemed to Paul
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked lonely, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) new black silk blouse with its bit of
white trimming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, mother, I s'll never marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, they all say that, my lad. You've not met the one yet. Only wait a
year or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shan't marry, mother. I shall live with you, and we'll have a
servant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, my lad, it's easy to talk. We'll see when the time comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What time? I'm nearly twenty-three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you're not one that would marry young. But in three years' time--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be with you just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see, my boy, we'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't want me to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't like to think of you going through your life without

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think I ought to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sooner or later every man ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'd rather it were later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It would be hard--and very hard. It's as they say:

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think I'd let a wife take me from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you wouldn't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to marry your mother as well as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Morel smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could do what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wouldn't have to interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother sat and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``go to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we'll have a pretty house, you and me, and a servant, and it'll be

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you to go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and went. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) plans for the future were always the same.

<p/>Mrs. Morel sat brooding--about her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) daughter, about Paul, about Arthur.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) fretted at losing Annie. The family was very closely bound. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) MUST live now, to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) children. Life was so rich for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Paul wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), and so did Arthur. Arthur never knew how deeply he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was a creature of the moment. Never yet had he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) been forced
to realise himself. The army had disciplined his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) body, but not his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) soul.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was in perfect health and very handsome. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dark, vigorous hair sat
close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) smallish head. There was something childish about his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nose,
something almost girlish about his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dark blue eyes. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had the fun
red mouth of a man under his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) brown moustache, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) jaw was strong.
It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father's mouth; it was the nose and eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own mother's
people--good-looking, weak-principled folk. Mrs. Morel was anxious about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had really run the rig he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was safe. But how far would he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
go?

<p/>The army had not really done him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) any good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) resented bitterly the
authority of the officers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hated having to obey as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were an
animal. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had too much sense to kick. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) attention
to getting the best out of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could sing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was a boon-companion.
Often he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) got into scrapes, but they were the manly scrapes that
are easily condoned. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made a good time out of it, whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
self-respect was in suppression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) trusted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) good looks and
handsome figure, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) refinement, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) decent education to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) most
of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wanted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was not disappointed. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was restless.
Something seemed to gnaw him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) inside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was never still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was never
alone. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was rather humble. Paul he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) admired and loved
and despised slightly. And Paul admired and loved and despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
slightly.

<p/>Mrs. Morel had had a few pounds left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
decided to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son out of the army. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was wild with joy. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
like a lad taking a holiday.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had always been fond of Beatrice Wyld, and during his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) furlough he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
picked up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was stronger and better in health. The
two often went long walks together, Arthur taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) arm in soldier's
fashion, rather stiffly. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) came to play the piano whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sang.
Then Arthur would unhook his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tunic collar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) grew flushed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes
were bright, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sang in a manly tenor. Afterwards they sat together on
the sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) seemed to flaunt his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) body: she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) so--the
strong chest, the sides, the thighs in their close-fitting trousers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) liked to lapse into the dialect when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) would
sometimes smoke with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) would only take a few whiffs
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cigarette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) one evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) reached for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cigarette.
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, tha doesna. I'll gi'e thee a smoke kiss if ter's a mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted a whiff, no kiss at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, an' tha s`lt ha'e a whiff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``along wi' t' kiss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want a draw at thy fag,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) cried, snatching for the cigarette
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lips.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shoulder touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was small and quick
as lightning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) just escaped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll gi'e thee a smoke kiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`rt a knivey nuisance, Arty Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said, sitting back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha'e a smoke kiss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The soldier</b></font>)</div><p/>The soldier leaned forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>), smiling. His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) face was near hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shonna!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) replied, turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) head.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) took a draw at his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) cigarette, and pursed up his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) mouth, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
lips close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) dark-brown cropped moustache stood out like a
brush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) looked at the puckered crimson lips, then suddenly snatched
the cigarette from his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) fingers and darted away. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), leaping after her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>),
seized the comb from her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) back hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) turned, threw the cigarette at
him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) picked it up, put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) mouth, and sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nuisance!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Give me my comb!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was afraid that her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) hair, specially done for him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), would come down.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) hid the comb between his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've non got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) said.

<p/>The cigarette trembled between his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) lips with laughter as he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''S true as I'm here!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) laughed, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You brazen imp!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) exclaimed, rushing and scuffling for the comb,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had under his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) knees. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) wrestled with him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), pulling at his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
smooth, tight-covered knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) laughed till he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) lay back on the sofa
shaking with laughter. The cigarette fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) mouth almost singeing
his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) throat. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) delicate tan the blood flushed up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) laughed
till his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) blue eyes were blinded, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) throat swollen almost to choking.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) sat up. Beatrice was putting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) comb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha tickled me, Beat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) said thickly.

<p/>Like a flash her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) small white hand went out and smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
started up, glaring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>). They stared at each other. Slowly the flush
mounted her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) cheek, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) eyes, then her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) sat down
sulkily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) went into the scullery to adjust her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) hair. In private there
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) shed a few tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) did not know what for.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) returned she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was pursed up close. But it was only a film over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), with ruffled hair, was sulking upon the sofa. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) sat down
opposite, in the armchair, and neither spoke. The clock ticked in the
silence like blows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a little cat, Beat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) said at length, half apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you shouldn't be brazen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) replied.

<p/>There was again a long silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) whistled to himself like a man much
agitated but defiant. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) went across to him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did it, pore fing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mocked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) face, smiling curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kiss?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daren't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) challenged, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) mouth lifted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>).

<p/>Deliberately, and with a peculiar quivering smile that seemed to
overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) whole body, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mouth on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). Immediately his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
arms folded round her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>). As soon as the long kiss was finished she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) drew
back her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) head from him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), put her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) delicate fingers on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) neck, through
the open collar. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) eyes, giving herself up again in a
kiss.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) acted of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) own free will. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) would do she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) did, and made
nobody responsible.


<p/>Paul felt life changing around him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The conditions of youth were gone.
Now it was a home of grown-up people. Annie was a married woman, Arthur
was following his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own pleasure in a way unknown to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) folk. For so long
they had all lived at home, and gone out to pass their time. But now,
for Annie and Arthur, life lay outside their mother's house. They came
home for holiday and for rest. So there was that strange, half-empty
feeling about the house, as if the birds had flown. Paul became more and
more unsettled. Annie and Arthur had gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was restless to follow.
Yet home was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother. And still there was something
else, something outside, something he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wanted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) grew more and more restless. Miriam did not satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) old mad
desire to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) grew weaker. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) met Clara in Nottingham,
sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went to meetings with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) at Willey
Farm. But on these last occasions the situation became strained. There
was a triangle of antagonism between Paul and Clara and Miriam. With
Clara he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took on a smart, worldly, mocking tone very antagonistic to
Miriam. It did not matter what went before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) might be intimate and
sad with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Then as soon as Clara appeared, it all vanished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
played to the newcomer.

<p/>Miriam had one beautiful evening with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in the hay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been on
the horse-rake, and having finished, came to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to put the hay in
cocks. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hopes and despairs, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whole
soul seemed to lie bare before her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) watched the very
quivering stuff of life in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The moon came out: they walked home
together: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed to have come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) so badly,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) love and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) faith. It seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) the best of himself to keep, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would
guard it all her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) life. Nay, the sky did not cherish the stars more
surely and eternally than she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would guard the good in the soul of Paul
Morel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went on home alone, feeling exalted, glad in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) faith.

<p/>And then, the next day, Clara came. They were to have tea in the
hayfield. Miriam watched the evening drawing to gold and shadow. And all
the time Paul was sporting with Clara. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made higher and higher heaps
of hay that they were jumping over. Miriam did not care for the game,
and stood aside. Edgar and Geoffrey and Maurice and Clara and Paul
jumped. Paul won, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was light. Clara's blood was roused. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
could run like an Amazon. Paul loved the determined way she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) rushed at
the hay-cock and leaped, landed on the other side, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breasts shaken,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) thick hair come undone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You touched!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You touched!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) flashed, turning to Edgar. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't touch, did I? Wasn't I
clear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>laughed Edgar.

<p/>None of them could say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you touched,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``You're beaten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did NOT touch!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As plain as anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Box his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ears for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cried to Edgar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>Edgar laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I daren't. You must do it yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And nothing can alter the fact that you touched,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>laughed Paul.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was furious with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) little triumph before these lads and men
was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had forgotten herself in the game. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was to humble
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are despicable!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/>And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed, in a way that tortured Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I KNEW you couldn't jump that heap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) teased.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) back on him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Yet everybody could see that the only person
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) listened to, or was conscious of, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It pleased
the men to see this battle between them. But Miriam was tortured.

<p/>Paul could choose the lesser in place of the higher, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could
be unfaithful to himself, unfaithful to the real, deep Paul Morel.
There was a danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) becoming frivolous, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) running after his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
satisfaction like any Arthur, or like his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) father. It made Miriam bitter
to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) should throw away his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soul for this flippant traffic of
triviality with Clara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked in bitterness and silence, while the
other two rallied each other, and Paul sported.

<p/>And afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not own it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was rather ashamed of
himself, and prostrated himself before Miriam. Then again he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rebelled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not religious to be religious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I reckon a crow is
religious when it sails across the sky. But it only does it because it
feels itself carried to where it's going, not because it thinks it is
being eternal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>But Miriam knew that one should be religious in everything, have God,
whatever God might be, present in everything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe God knows such a lot about Himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``God
doesn't KNOW things, He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) IS things. And I'm sure He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s not soulful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>And then it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) that Paul was arguing God on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own side,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own way and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own pleasure. There was a long
battle between him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was utterly unfaithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
own presence; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was ashamed, then repentant; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>),
and went off again. Those were the ever-recurring conditions.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fretted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) remained--sad,
pensive, a worshipper. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sorrow. Half the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
grieved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), half the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) conscience; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt, somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had got a conscience that was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), because in one way she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did hold the best of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
could not stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not take the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), which
was three-quarters. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chafed himself into rawness over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was twenty-one he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) a letter which could only have been
written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).


<p/>``May I speak of our old, worn love, this last time. It, too, is
changing, is it not? Say, has not the body of that love died, and left
you its invulnerable soul? You see, I can give you a spirit love, I have
given it you this long, long time; but not embodied passion. See, you
are a nun. I have given you what I would give a holy nun--as a mystic
monk to a mystic nun. Surely you esteem it best. Yet you regret--no,
have regretted--the other. In all our relations no body enters. I do not
talk to you through the senses--rather through the spirit. That is why
we cannot love in the common sense. Ours is not an everyday affection.
As yet we are mortal, and to live side by side with one another would be
dreadful, for somehow with you I cannot long be trivial, and, you know,
to be always beyond this mortal state would be to lose it. If people
marry, they must live together as affectionate humans, who may be
commonplace with each other without feeling awkward--not as two souls.
So I feel it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought I to send this letter?--I doubt it. But there--it is best to
understand. Au revoir.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam read this letter twice, after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sealed it up. A year
later she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) broke the seal to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mother the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a nun--you are a nun.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart again and
again. Nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ever had said had gone into her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) so deeply, fixedly,
like a mortal wound.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) two days after the party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Our intimacy would have been all-beautiful but for one little
mistake,'''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) quoted. <div class="bookquote">``Was the mistake mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) from Nottingham, sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) at the
same time a little <div class="bookquote">``Omar Khayyam.''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``I am glad you answered; you are so calm and natural you put me
to shame. What a ranter I am! We are often out of sympathy. But in
fundamentals we may always be together I think.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must thank you for your sympathy with my painting and drawing. Many a
sketch is dedicated to you. I do look forward to your criticisms, which,
to my shame and glory, are always grand appreciations. It is a lovely
joke, that. Au revoir.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the end of the first phase of Paul's love affair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was now
about twenty-three years old, and, though still virgin, the sex instinct
that Miriam had over-refined for so long now grew particularly strong.
Often, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talked to Clara Dawes, came that thickening and quickening
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood, that peculiar concentration in the breast, as if something
were alive there, a new self or a new centre of consciousness, warning
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that sooner or later he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have to ask one woman or another. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) belonged to Miriam. Of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was so fixedly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) allowed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) right.



<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>CLARA

<p/>WHEN he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was twenty-three years old, Paul sent in a landscape to the
winter exhibition at Nottingham Castle. Miss Jordan had taken a good
deal of interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) met
other artists. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was beginning to grow ambitious.

<p/>One morning the postman came just as he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) was washing in the scullery.
Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) heard a wild noise from his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) mother. Rushing into the
kitchen, he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) standing on the hearthrug wildly waving a
letter and crying <div class="bookquote">``Hurrah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had gone mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) was shocked and
frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flew to him (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>), flung her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) for a moment, then waved the
letter, crying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurrah, my boy! I knew we should do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--the small, severe woman with graying hair suddenly
bursting out in such frenzy. The postman came running back, afraid
something had happened. They saw his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) tipped cap over the short curtains.
Mrs. Morel rushed to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) picture's got first prize, Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``and is sold for
twenty guineas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My word, that's something like!''  (<font color='red'><b>the postman</b></font>)</div>said the young postman, whom they had
known all his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Major Moreton has bought it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks like meanin' something, that does, Mrs. Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the postman</b></font>)</div>said the
postman, his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) blue eyes bright. He (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) was glad to have brought such a lucky
letter. Mrs. Morel went indoors and sat down, trembling. Paul was afraid
lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) might have misread the letter, and might be disappointed after
all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) scrutinised it once, twice. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) became convinced it was
true. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat down, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart beating with joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I SAY we should do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, pretending she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was not crying.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took the kettle off the fire and mashed the tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't think, mother--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began tentatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my son--not so much--but I expected a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no--but I knew we should do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) composure, apparently at least. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shirt turned back, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) young throat almost like a girl's,
and the towel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hair sticking up wet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty guineas, mother! That's just what you wanted to buy Arthur out.
Now you needn't borrow any. It'll just do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I shan't take it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I shan't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--you have twelve pounds, I'll have nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They cavilled about sharing the twenty guineas. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted to take only
the five pounds she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) needed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not hear of it. So they got over
the stress of emotion by quarrelling.

<p/>Morel came home at night from the pit, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They tell me Paul's got first prize for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) picture, and sold it to
Lord Henry Bentley for fifty pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what stories people do tell!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I said I wor sure it wor a lie. But they said tha'd
told Fred Hodgkisson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) such stuff!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>assented the miner.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was disappointed nevertheless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's true he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has got the first prize,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>The miner sat heavily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), beguy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stared across the room fixedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But as for fifty pounds--such nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was silent awhile. <div class="bookquote">``Major
Moreton bought it for twenty guineas, that's true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty guineas! Tha niver says!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and it was worth it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't misdoubt it. But twenty guineas for a bit of a
paintin' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) knocked off in an hour or two!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was silent with conceit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) son. Mrs. Morel sniffed, as if it were
nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when does he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) handle th' money?''  (<font color='red'><b>the collier</b></font>)</div>asked the collier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I couldn't tell you. When the picture is sent home, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence. Morel stared at the sugar-basin instead of eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
dinner. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) black arm, with the hand all gnarled with work lay on the
table. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife pretended not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rub the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand across
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes, nor the smear in the coal-dust on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) black face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, an' that other lad `ud 'a done as much if they hadna ha' killed
`im,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/>The thought of William went through Mrs. Morel like a cold blade. It
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was tired, and wanted rest.

<p/>Paul was invited to dinner at Mr. Jordan's. Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, I want an evening suit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I was afraid you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was glad. There was
a moment or two of silence. <div class="bookquote">``There's that one of William's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``that I know cost four pounds ten and which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'d only worn
three times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you like me to wear it, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I think it would fit you--at least the coat. The trousers would
want shortening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went upstairs and put on the coat and vest. Coming down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked
strange in a flannel collar and a flannel shirt-front, with an evening
coat and vest. It was rather large.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The tailor can make it right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``It's beautiful stuff. I never could find in my heart to let
your father wear the trousers, and very glad I am now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand over the silk collar she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
eldest son. But this son was living enough inside the clothes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand down his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) back to feel him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was alive and hers. The
other was dead.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went out to dinner several times in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) evening suit that had been
William's. Each time his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother's heart was firm with pride and joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
was started now. The studs she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and the children had bought for William
were in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shirt-front; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wore one of William's dress shirts. But he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had an elegant figure. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face was rough, but warm-looking and rather
pleasing. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not look particularly a gentleman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
looked quite a man.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) everything that took place, everything that was said. It was
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been there. And he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was dying to introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to these new
friends who had dinner at seven-thirty in the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go along with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What do they want to know me for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cried indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``If they want to know me--and they say
they do--then they want to know you, because you are quite as clever as
I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go along with you, child!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands. They, too, were work-gnarled now. The
skin was shiny with so much hot water, the knuckles rather swollen. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to be careful to keep them out of soda. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) regretted what
they had been--so small and exquisite. And when Annie insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
having more stylish blouses to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) age, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) submitted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) even
went so far as to allow a black velvet bow to be placed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) hair.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) sniffed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) sarcastic manner, and was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) looked a
sight. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) looked a lady, Paul declared, as much as Mrs. Major
Moreton, and far, far nicer. The family was coming on. Only Morel
remained unchanged, or rather, lapsed slowly.

<p/>Paul and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother now had long discussions about life. Religion was
fading into the background. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had shovelled away all the beliefs that
would hamper him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), had cleared the ground, and come more or less to the
bedrock of belief that one should feel inside oneself for right and
wrong, and should have the patience to gradually realise one's God. Now
life interested him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to belong to the
well-to-do middle class. I like my common people best. I belong to the
common people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if anyone else said so, my son, wouldn't you be in a tear. YOU know
you consider yourself equal to any gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``not in my class or my education or my
manners. But in myself I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then. Then why talk about the common people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--the difference between people isn't in their class, but in
themselves. Only from the middle classes one gets ideas, and from the
common people--life itself, warmth. You feel their hates and loves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well, my boy. But, then, why don't you go and talk to
your father's pals?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they're rather different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. They're the common people. After all, whom do you mix with
now--among the common people? Those that exchange ideas, like the middle
classes. The rest don't interest you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--there's the life--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe there's a jot more life from Miriam than you could get
from any educated girl--say Miss Moreton. It is YOU who are snobbish
about class.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) frankly WANTED him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to climb into the middle classes, a thing not
very difficult, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in the end to marry a lady.

<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to combat him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) restless fretting. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) still kept up
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) connection with Miriam, could neither break free nor go the whole
length of engagement. And this indecision seemed to bleed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
energy. Moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) of an unrecognised leaning
towards Clara, and, since the latter was a married woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
would fall in love with one of the girls in a better station of life.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was stupid, and would refuse to love or even to admire a girl
much, just because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) social superior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother cleverness</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``all your cleverness, your breaking
away from old things, and taking life in your own hands, doesn't seem to
bring you much happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is happiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It's nothing to me! How AM I to be
happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The plump question disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's for you to judge, my lad. But if you could meet some GOOD
woman who would MAKE you happy--and you began to think of settling your
life--when you have the means--so that you could work without all this
fretting--it would be much better for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) frowned. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother caught him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) on the raw of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wound of Miriam.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pushed the tumbled hair off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forehead, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes full of pain and
fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean easy, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``That's a woman's whole doctrine for
life--ease of soul and physical comfort. And I do despise it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do you!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``And do you call yours a divine
discontent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I don't care about its divinity. But damn your happiness! So long
as life's full, it doesn't matter whether it's happy or not. I'm afraid
your happiness would bore me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never give it a chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. Then suddenly all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passion
of grief over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) broke out. <div class="bookquote">``But it does matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``And you
OUGHT to be happy, you ought to try to be happy, to live to be happy.
How could I bear to think your life wouldn't be a happy one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your own's been bad enough, mater, but it hasn't left you so much worse
off than the folk who've been happier. I reckon you've done well. And I
am the same. Aren't I well enough off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not, my son. Battle--battle--and suffer. It's about all you do,
as far as I can see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not, my dear? I tell you it's the best--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't. And one OUGHT to be happy, one OUGHT.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time Mrs. Morel was trembling violently. Struggles of this kind
often took place between her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) seemed to fight for
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) very life against his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own will to die. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was ill and pitiful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Little,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``So long as you don't feel life's
paltry and a miserable business, the rest doesn't matter, happiness or
unhappiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I want you to be happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said pathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, my dear--say rather you want me to live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart would break for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). At this rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would not live. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had that poignant carelessness about himself,
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own suffering, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own life, which is a form of slow suicide. It
almost broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart. With all the passion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) strong nature she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
hated Miriam for having in this subtle way undermined his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) joy. It did
not matter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) that Miriam could not help it. Miriam did it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wished so much he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would fall in love with a girl equal to be his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
mate--educated and strong. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would not look at anybody above him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
in station. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seemed to like Mrs. Dawes. At any rate that feeling was
wholesome. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother prayed and prayed for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might not be
wasted. That was all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) prayer--not for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) soul or his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) righteousness,
but that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might not be wasted. And while he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) slept, for hours and hours
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought and prayed for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) drifted away from Miriam imperceptibly, without knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was going.
Arthur only left the army to be married. The baby was born six months
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wedding. Mrs. Morel got him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a job under the firm again, at
twenty-one shillings a week. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) furnished for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), with the help of
Beatrice's mother, a little cottage of two rooms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was caught now. It
did not matter how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) kicked and struggled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was fast. For a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
chafed, was irritable with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) young wife, who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went almost
distracted when the baby, which was delicate, cried or gave trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
grumbled for hours to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only said: <div class="bookquote">``Well, my lad, you did
it yourself, now you must make the best of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And then the grit
came out in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) buckled to work, undertook his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) responsibilities,
acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife and child, and did make a good
best of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had never been very closely inbound into the family. Now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was gone altogether.

<p/>The months went slowly along. Paul had more or less got into connection
with the Socialist, Suffragette, Unitarian people in Nottingham, owing
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) acquaintance with Clara. One day a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and of Clara's,
in Bestwood, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to take a message to Mrs. Dawes. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went in the
evening across Sneinton Market to Bluebell Hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) found the house in
a mean little street paved with granite cobbles and having causeways of
dark blue, grooved bricks. The front door went up a step from off this
rough pavement, where the feet of the passersby rasped and clattered.
The brown paint on the door was so old that the naked wood showed
between the rents. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stood on the street below and knocked. There came
a heavy footstep; a large, stout woman of about sixty towered above him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from the pavement. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a rather severe face.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) into the parlour, which opened on to the street. It was
a small, stuffy, defunct room, of mahogany, and deathly enlargements of
photographs of departed people done in carbon. Mrs. Radford left him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) was stately, almost martial. In a moment Clara appeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) flushed
deeply, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was covered with confusion. It seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did not
like being discovered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) home circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it couldn't be your voice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) invited him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
out of the mausoleum of a parlour into the kitchen.

<p/>That was a little, darkish room too, but it was smothered in white lace.
The mother had seated herself again by the cupboard, and was drawing
thread from a vast web of lace. A clump of fluff and ravelled cotton was
at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) right hand, a heap of three-quarter-inch lace lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
left, whilst in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was the mountain of lace web, piling the
hearthrug. Threads of curly cotton, pulled out from between the lengths
of lace, strewed over the fender and the fireplace. Paul dared not go
forward, for fear of treading on piles of white stuff.

<p/>On the table was a jenny for carding the lace. There was a pack of brown
cardboard squares, a pack of cards of lace, a little box of pins, and on
the sofa lay a heap of drawn lace.

<p/>The room was all lace, and it was so dark and warm that the white, snowy
stuff seemed the more distinct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're coming in you won't have to mind the work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Radford. <div class="bookquote">``I know we're about blocked up. But sit you down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara, much embarrassed, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a chair against the wall opposite the
white heaps. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) herself took her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) place on the sofa, shamedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you drink a bottle of stout?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Radford asked. <div class="bookquote">``Clara, get him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
a bottle of stout.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) protested, but Mrs. Radford insisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look as if you could do with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you never any
more colour than that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only a thick skin I've got that doesn't show the blood through,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Clara, ashamed and chagrined, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a bottle of stout and a glass.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) poured out some of the black stuff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, lifting the glass, <div class="bookquote">``here's health!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Radford.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took a drink of stout.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And light yourself a cigarette, so long as you don't set the house on
fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Radford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you needn't thank me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I s'll be glad to smell a
bit of smoke in th' `ouse again. A house o' women is as dead as a house
wi' no fire, to my thinkin'. I'm not a spider as likes a corner to
myself. I like a man about, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s only something to snap at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara began to work. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) jenny spun with a subdued buzz; the white
lace hopped from between her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fingers on to the card. It was filled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
snipped off the length, and pinned the end down to the banded lace. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put a new card in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) jenny. Paul watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sat square and
magnificent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) throat and arms were bare. The blood still mantled
below her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ears; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head in shame of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) humility. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face was
set on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) work. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms were creamy and full of life beside the white
lace; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) large, well-kept hands worked with a balanced movement, as if
nothing would hurry them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), not knowing, watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) all the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
saw the arch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) neck from the shoulder, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw
the coil of dun hair; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) moving, gleaming arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard a bit about you from Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>continued the mother. <div class="bookquote">``You're
in Jordan's, aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lace unceasing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, well, and I can remember when Thomas Jordan used to ask ME for one
of my toffies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>laughed Paul. <div class="bookquote">``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) get it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) did, sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) didn't--which was latterly. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>)'s the
sort that takes all and gives naught, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) is--or used to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>)'s very decent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; well, I'm glad to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Radford looked across at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) steadily. There was something
determined about her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) face was falling loose, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>)
eyes were calm, and there was something strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) that made it
seem she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) was not old; merely her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) wrinkles and loose cheeks were an
anachronism. She (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) had the strength and sang-froid of a woman in the prime
of life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) continued drawing the lace with slow, dignified movements.
The big web came up inevitably over her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) apron; the length of lace fell
away at her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) arms were finely shapen, but glossy and yellow
as old ivory. They had not the peculiar dull gleam that made Clara's so
fascinating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you've been going with Miriam Leivers?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the mother asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)'s a nice girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)'s very nice, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)'s a
bit too much above this world to suit my fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) is a bit like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) agreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)'ll never be satisfied till she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>)'s got wings and can fly over
everybody's head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Leivers</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>Clara broke in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) message. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) spoke humbly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>)
had surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) drudgery. To have her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) humble made him (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) feel as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) were lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) head in expectation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like jennying?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can a woman do!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it sweated?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More or less. Isn't ALL woman's work? That's another trick the men have
played, since we force ourselves into the labour market.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, you shut up about the men,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``If the women
wasn't fools, the men wouldn't be bad uns, that's what I say. No man was
ever that bad wi' me but what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got it back again. Not but what they're
a lousy lot, there's no denying it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they're all right really, aren't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they're a bit different from women,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you care to be back at Jordan's?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) asked Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother; <div class="bookquote">``thank her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stars if she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get
back. Don't you listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s for ever on that `igh horse of
hers, an' it's back's that thin an' starved it'll cut her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in two one of
these days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara suffered badly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother. Paul felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes were
coming very wide open. Wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to take Clara's fulminations so
seriously, after all? She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) spun steadily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) experienced a
thrill of joy, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) might need his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) help. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) seemed denied and
deprived of so much. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm moved mechanically, that should never
have been subdued to a mechanism, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head was bowed to the lace,
that never should have been bowed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) seemed to be stranded there
among the refuse that life has thrown away, doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) jennying. It was
a bitter thing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to be put aside by life, as if it had no use for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). No wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) protested.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) came with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood below in the mean street,
looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). So fine she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stature and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bearing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) of Juno dethroned. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood in the doorway, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) winced
from the street, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) surroundings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will go with Mrs. Hodgkisson to Hucknall?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was talking quite meaninglessly, only watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) grey eyes at
last met his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). They looked dumb with humiliation, pleading with a kind of
captive misery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was shaken and at a loss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) high and
mighty.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to run. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went to the station in a sort of
dream, and was at home without realising he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had moved out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) street.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had an idea that Susan, the overseer of the Spiral girls, was about
to be married. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) the next day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Susan, I heard a whisper of your getting married. What about
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>Susan flushed red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's been talking to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody. I merely heard a whisper that you WERE thinking--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am, though you needn't tell anybody. What's more, I wish I
wasn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Susan, you won't make me believe that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't I? You CAN believe it, though. I'd rather stop here a thousand
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul was perturbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Susan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl's colour was high, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) eyes flashed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And must you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). There was about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a candour and
gentleness which made the women trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Tears came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll see it'll turn out all right. You'll make the best of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued rather wistfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing else for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yea, there's making the worst of it. Try and make it all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soon made occasion to call again on Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``care to come back to Jordan's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) work, laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) beautiful arms on the table, and looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for some moments without answering. Gradually the flush mounted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Paul felt rather awkward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, because Susan is thinking of leaving,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Clara went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) jennying. The white lace leaped in little jumps
and bounds on to the card. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Without raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said at last, in a peculiar low voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you said anything about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except to you, not a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was again a long silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will apply when the advertisement is out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will apply before that. I will let you know exactly when.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) went on spinning her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) little machine, and did not contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>Clara came to Jordan's. Some of the older hands, Fanny among them,
remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) earlier rule, and cordially disliked the memory. Clara
had always been <div class="bookquote">``ikey'' (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>, reserved, and superior. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had never mixed with
the girls as one of themselves. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had occasion to find fault, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
did it coolly and with perfect politeness, which the defaulter felt to
be a bigger insult than crassness. Towards Fanny, the poor, overstrung
hunchback, Clara was unfailingly compassionate and gentle, as a result
of which Fanny shed more bitter tears than ever the rough tongues of the
other overseers had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>There was something in Clara that Paul disliked, and much that piqued
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) were about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) always watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) strong throat or her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) neck,
upon which the blonde hair grew low and fluffy. There was a fine down,
almost invisible, upon the skin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face and arms, and when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had perceived it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw it always.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work, painting in the afternoon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would come and
stand near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), perfectly motionless. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
neither spoke nor touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood a yard away he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were in contact with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could paint no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flung
down the brushes, and turned to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) praised his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work; sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was critical and cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are affected in that piece,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would say; and, as there was an
element of truth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) condemnation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood boiled with anger.

<p/>Again: <div class="bookquote">``What of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would ask enthusiastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) made a small doubtful sound. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't interest me much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you don't understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) retorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why ask me about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I thought you would understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would shrug her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shoulders in scorn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) maddened him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was furious. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and went into passionate exposition of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stuff. This amused and stimulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) never owned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
had been wrong.

<p/>During the ten years that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had belonged to the women's movement
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had acquired a fair amount of education, and, having had some of
Miriam's passion to be instructed, had taught herself French, and could
read in that language with a struggle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) considered herself as a woman
apart, and particularly apart, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) class. The girls in the Spiral
department were all of good homes. It was a small, special industry, and
had a certain distinction. There was an air of refinement in both rooms.
But Clara was aloof also from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fellow-workers.

<p/>None of these things, however, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) reveal to Paul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was not the
one to give herself away. There was a sense of mystery about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
was so reserved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had much to reserve. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) history was open
on the surface, but its inner meaning was hidden from everybody. It was
exciting. And then sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) from under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) brows with an almost furtive, sullen scrutiny, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) move
quickly. Often she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes. But then her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) own were, as it were,
covered over, revealing nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a little, lenient smile.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) extraordinarily provocative, because of the knowledge she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
seemed to possess, and gathered fruit of experience he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not attain.

<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) picked up a copy of _Lettres de mon Moulin_ from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
work-bench.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You read French, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried.

<p/>Clara glanced round negligently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was making an elastic stocking
of heliotrope silk, turning the Spiral machine with slow, balanced
regularity, occasionally bending down to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) work or to adjust the
needles; then her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) magnificent neck, with its down and fine pencils of
hair, shone white against the lavender, lustrous silk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned a few
more rounds, and stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked, smiling sweetly.

<p/>Paul's eyes glittered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) insolent indifference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know you read French,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, very polite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied, with a faint, sarcastic smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rotten swank!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, but scarcely loud enough to be heard.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth angrily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) seemed to scorn the
work she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mechanically produced; yet the hose she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) made were as nearly
perfect as possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't like Spiral work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, all work is work,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew all about it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) marvelled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) coldness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to do everything hotly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) must be
something special.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you prefer to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) indulgently, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is so little likelihood of my ever being given a choice, that I
haven't wasted time considering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, contemptuous on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) side now. <div class="bookquote">``You only say that because
you're too proud to own up what you want and can't get.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know me very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you think you're terrific great shakes, and that you live under
the eternal insult of working in a factory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was very angry and very rude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) merely turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in
disdain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walked whistling down the room, flirted and laughed with
Hilda.

<p/>Later on he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to himself:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was I so impudent to Clara for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was rather annoyed with
himself, at the same time glad. <div class="bookquote">``Serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) right; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stinks with silent
pride,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to himself angrily.

<p/>In the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came down. There was a certain weight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
heart which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to remove. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought to do it by offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>)
chocolates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have one?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I bought a handful to sweeten me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) great relief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) accepted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat on the work-bench beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>)
machine, twisting a piece of silk round his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) finger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) quick, unexpected movements, like a young animal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feet swung
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pondered. The sweets lay strewn on the bench. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>)
machine, grinding rhythmically, then stooping to see the stocking
that hung beneath, pulled down by the weight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched the handsome
crouching of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) back, and the apron-strings curling on the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is always about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``a sort of waiting. Whatever I see
you doing, you're not really there: you are waiting--like Penelope when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) weaving.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not help a spurt of wickedness. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
call you Penelope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it make any difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) said, carefully removing one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>)
needles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't matter, so long as it pleases me. Here, I say, you seem to
forget I'm your boss. It just occurs to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does that mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) asked coolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It means I've got a right to boss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything you want to complain about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say, you needn't be nasty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you want,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) said, continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) task.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to treat me nicely and respectfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call you `sir', perhaps?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hilda</b></font>) asked quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, call me `sir'. I should love it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I wish you would go upstairs, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth closed, and a frown came on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) jumped suddenly down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're too blessed superior for anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went away to the other girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was being angrier than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had any need to be. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) doubted slightly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was showing
off. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would. Clara heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughing, in a way
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hated, with the girls down the next room.

<p/>When at evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went through the department after the girls had gone,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chocolates lying untouched in front of Clara's machine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
left them. In the morning they were still there, and Clara was at work.
Later on Minnie, a little brunette they called Pussy, called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, haven't you got a chocolate for anybody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Pussy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I meant to have offered them; then I went
and forgot 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll bring you some this afternoon. You don't want them after they've
been lying about, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pussy</b></font>)</div>smiled Pussy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They'll be dusty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went up to Clara's bench.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry I left these things littering about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) flushed scarlet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gathered them together in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll be dirty now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You should have taken them. I wonder
why you didn't. I meant to have told you I wanted you to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flung them out of the window into the yard below. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) just glanced at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) winced from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>In the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brought another packet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you take some?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, offering them first to Clara. <div class="bookquote">``These are
fresh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) accepted one, and put it on to the bench.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, take several--for luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) took a couple more, and put them on the bench also. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned
in confusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went on up the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are, Pussy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be greedy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they all for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>cried the others, rushing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they're not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>The girls clamoured round. Pussy drew back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come out!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I can have first pick, can't I, Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be nice with 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, and went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ARE a dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>the girls cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tenpence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went past Clara without speaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt the three chocolate creams
would burn her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) touched them. It needed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) courage to slip
them into the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) apron.

<p/>The girls loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and were afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was so nice while he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was nice, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were offended, so distant, treating them as if they
scarcely existed, or not more than the bobbins of thread. And then, if
they were impudent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said quietly: <div class="bookquote">``Do you mind going on with your
work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and stood and watched.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) celebrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) twenty-third birthday, the house was in trouble.
Arthur was just going to be married. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother was not well. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
father, getting an old man, and lame from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) accidents, was given
a paltry, poor job. Miriam was an eternal reproach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) owed
himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), yet could not give himself. The house, moreover, needed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) support. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was pulled in all directions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was not glad it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
birthday. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bitter.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) got to work at eight o'clock. Most of the clerks had not turned up.
The girls were not due till 8.30. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) heard
a voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul, Paul, I want you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Fanny, the hunchback, standing at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stairs, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face
radiant with a secret. Paul looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood, at a loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) coaxed. <div class="bookquote">``Come before you begin on the letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went down the half-dozen steps into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dry, narrow, <div class="bookquote">``finishing-off''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>room. Fanny walked before him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) black bodice was short--the waist was
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) armpits--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) green-black cashmere skirt seemed very
long, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) strode with big strides before the young man, himself so
graceful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat at the narrow end of the room, where the
window opened on to chimney-pots. Paul watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thin hands and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
flat red wrists as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) excitedly twitched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) white apron, which was
spread on the bench in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't think we'd forgot you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) asked, reproachful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) birthday himself.

<p/>''`Why,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) says! ``Why!<div class="bookquote">'' Why, look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pointed to the calendar,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw, surrounding the big black number <div class="bookquote">``21'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, hundreds of little
crosses in black-lead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, kisses for my birthday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``How did you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you want to know, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>Fanny mocked, hugely delighted.
<div class="bookquote">``There's one from everybody--except Lady Clara--and two from some. But I
shan't tell you how many I put.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know, you're spooney,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There you ARE mistaken!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, indignant. <div class="bookquote">``I could never be so
soft.''  (<font color='red'><b>contralto</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) voice was strong and contralto.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You always pretend to be such a hard-hearted hussy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``And
you know you're as sentimental--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather be called sentimental than frozen meat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>Fanny blurted. Paul
knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) referred to Clara, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you say such nasty things about me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my duck,''  (<font color='red'><b>hunchback</b></font>)</div>the hunchback woman answered, lavishly tender. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
thirty-nine. <div class="bookquote">``No, my duck, because you don't think yourself a fine
figure in marble and us nothing but dirt. I'm as good as you, aren't I,
Paul?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and the question delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, we're not better than one another, are we?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm as good as you, aren't I, Paul?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) persisted daringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you are. If it comes to goodness, you're better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was rather afraid of the situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might get hysterical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I'd get here before the others--won't they say I'm deep! Now
shut your eyes--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And open your mouth, and see what God sends you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued, suiting
action to words, and expecting a piece of chocolate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard the rustle
of the apron, and a faint clink of metal. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes. Fanny, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) long cheeks flushed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) blue eyes
shining, was gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). There was a little bundle of paint-tubes on
the bench before him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From us all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answered hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they the right sort?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) asked, rocking herself with delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jove! they're the best in the catalogue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they're the right sorts?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're off the little list I'd made to get when my ship came in.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lip.

<p/>Fanny was overcome with emotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must turn the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They was all on thorns to do it; they all paid their shares, all except
the Queen of Sheba.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Queen</b></font>)</div><p/>The Queen of Sheba was Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And wouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) join?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) didn't get the chance; we never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>); we wasn't going to have
HER bossing THIS show. We didn't WANT her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) to join.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul laughed at the woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was much moved. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) must go. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was very close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) neck and
kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) vehemently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give you a kiss to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``You've looked
so white, it's made my heart ache.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms were so pitifully thin that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
heart ached also.

<p/>That day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) met Clara as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ran downstairs to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands at
dinner-time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have stayed to dinner!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed. It was unusual for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I seem to have dined on old surgical-appliance stock. I MUST
go out now, or I shall feel stale india-rubber right through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lingered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) instantly caught at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going anywhere?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>They went together up to the Castle. Outdoors she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) dressed very plainly,
down to ugliness; indoors she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) always looked nice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked with
hesitating steps alongside Paul, bowing and turning away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
Dowdy in dress, and drooping, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) showed to great disadvantage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could
scarcely recognise her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) strong form, that seemed to slumber with power.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) appeared almost insignificant, drowning her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stature in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stoop, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shrank from the public gaze.

<p/>The Castle grounds were very green and fresh. Climbing the precipitous
ascent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed and chattered, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was silent, seeming to brood
over something. There was scarcely time to go inside the squat, square
building that crowns the bluff of rock. They leaned upon the wall where
the cliff runs sheer down to the Park. Below them, in their holes in the
sandstone, pigeons preened themselves and cooed softly. Away down upon
the boulevard at the foot of the rock, tiny trees stood in their
own pools of shadow, and tiny people went scurrying about in almost
ludicrous importance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You feel as if you could scoop up the folk like tadpoles, and have a
handful of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) laughed, answering:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it is not necessary to get far off in order to see us
proportionately. The trees are much more significant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bulk only,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) laughed cynically.

<p/>Away beyond the boulevard the thin stripes of the metals showed upon the
railway-track, whose margin was crowded with little stacks of timber,
beside which smoking toy engines fussed. Then the silver string of the
canal lay at random among the black heaps. Beyond, the dwellings, very
dense on the river flat, looked like black, poisonous herbage, in thick
rows and crowded beds, stretching right away, broken now and then by
taller plants, right to where the river glistened in a hieroglyph across
the country. The steep scarp cliffs across the river looked puny. Great
stretches of country darkened with trees and faintly brightened with
corn-land, spread towards the haze, where the hills rose blue beyond
grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is comforting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes/Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dawes, <div class="bookquote">``to think the town goes no farther.
It is only a LITTLE sore upon the country yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes/Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little scab,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) shivered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) loathed the town. Looking drearily across at the
country which was forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) impassive face, pale and hostile,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) reminded Paul of one of the bitter, remorseful angels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the town's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it's only temporary. This is the
crude, clumsy make-shift we've practised on, till we find out what the
idea is. The town will come all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The pigeons in the pockets of rock, among the perched bushes, cooed
comfortably. To the left the large church of St. Mary rose into space,
to keep close company with the Castle, above the heaped rubble of the
town. Mrs. Dawes smiled brightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) looked across the country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Great compliment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm! that's snatching back with the left hand what you gave with the
right, and no mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) laughed in amusement at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what was the matter with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I know you were brooding
something special. I can see the stamp of it on your face yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I will not tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, hug it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) flushed and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) lip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it was the girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about 'em?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have been plotting something for a week now, and to-day they seem
particularly full of it. All alike; they insult me with their secrecy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked in concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) went on, in the metallic, angry tone, <div class="bookquote">``if they
did not thrust it into my face--the fact that they have a secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just like women,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hateful, their mean gloating,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said intensely.

<p/>Paul was silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew what the girls gloated over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was sorry to be
the cause of this new dissension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They can have all the secrets in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) went on, brooding
bitterly; <div class="bookquote">``but they might refrain from glorying in them, and making me
feel more out of it than ever. It is--it is almost unbearable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul thought for a few minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was much perturbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you what it's all about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, pale and nervous. <div class="bookquote">``It's
my birthday, and they've bought me a fine lot of paints, all the
girls. They're jealous of you'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) stiffen coldly at the word
`jealous'--<div class="bookquote">``merely because I sometimes bring you a book,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) added
slowly. <div class="bookquote">``But, you see, it's only a trifle. Don't bother about it, will
you--because'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed quickly--<div class="bookquote">``well, what would they say if they
saw us here now, in spite of their victory?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) clumsy reference to their present
intimacy. It was almost insolent of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was so quiet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), although it cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) an effort.

<p/>Their two hands lay on the rough stone parapet of the Castle wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother a fineness of mould, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands
were small and vigorous. Hers were large, to match her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) large limbs, but
white and powerful looking. As Paul looked at them he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is
wanting somebody to take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands--for all she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is so contemptuous of
us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to himself. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) two hands, so warm
and alive, which seemed to live for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was brooding now, staring
out over the country from under sullen brows. The little, interesting
diversity of shapes had vanished from the scene; all that remained was a
vast, dark matrix of sorrow and tragedy, the same in all the houses
and the river-flats and the people and the birds; they were only shapen
differently. And now that the forms seemed to have melted away, there
remained the mass from which all the landscape was composed, a dark mass
of struggle and pain. The factory, the girls, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, the
large, uplifted church, the thicket of the town, merged into one
atmosphere--dark, brooding, and sorrowful, every bit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that two o'clock striking?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes/Dawes</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dawes said in surprise.

<p/>Paul started, and everything sprang into form, regained its
individuality, its forgetfulness, and its cheerfulness.

<p/>They hurried back to work.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was in the rush of preparing for the night's post, examining the
work up from Fanny's room, which smelt of ironing, the evening postman
came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Mr. Paul Morel,'''  (<font color='red'><b>the evening postman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, smiling, handing Paul a package. <div class="bookquote">``A lady's
handwriting! Don't let the girls see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The postman</b></font>)</div><p/>The postman, himself a favourite, was pleased to make fun of the girls'
affection for Paul.

<p/>It was a volume of verse with a brief note: <div class="bookquote">``You will allow me to send
you this, and so spare me my isolation. I also sympathise and wish you
well.--C.D.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul flushed hot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord! Mrs. Dawes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) can't afford it. Good Lord, who ever'd have
thought it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was suddenly intensely moved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was filled with the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
In the glow he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could almost feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) were present--her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arms,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shoulders, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bosom, see them, feel them, almost contain them.

<p/>This move on the part of Clara brought them into closer intimacy. The
other girls noticed that when Paul met Mrs. Dawes his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes lifted and
gave that peculiar bright greeting which they could interpret. Knowing
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was unaware, Clara made no sign, save that occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned
aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/>They walked out together very often at dinner-time; it was quite open,
quite frank. Everybody seemed to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was quite unaware of the
state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own feeling, and that nothing was wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
now with some of the old fervour with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had talked to Miriam, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cared less about the talk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not bother about his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) conclusions.

<p/>One day in October they went out to Lambley for tea. Suddenly they came
to a halt on top of the hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) climbed and sat on a gate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sat
on the stile. The afternoon was perfectly still, with a dim haze, and
yellow sheaves glowing through. They were quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How old were you when you married?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) voice was subdued, almost submissive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is eight years ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when did you leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five years! Did you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) when you married him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was silent for some time; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said slowly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I did--more or less. I didn't think much about it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
wanted me. I was very prudish then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you sort of walked into it without thinking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I seemed to have been asleep nearly all my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Somnambule_? But--when did you wake up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I ever did, or ever have--since I was a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You went to sleep as you grew to be a woman? How queer! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) didn't
wake you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) never got there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied, in a monotone.

<p/>The brown birds dashed over the hedges where the rose-hips stood naked
and scarlet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got where?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) never really mattered to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The afternoon was so gently warm and dim. Red roofs of the cottages
burned among the blue haze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could feel, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
could not understand, what Clara was saying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why did you leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) horrid to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shuddered lightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sort of degraded me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wanted to bully me because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hadn't
got me. And then I felt as if I wanted to run, as if I was fastened and
bound up. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) seemed dirty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not at all see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) always dirty?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied slowly. <div class="bookquote">``And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) couldn't get
AT me, really. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) got brutal--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) WAS brutal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why did you leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) finally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was unfaithful to me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both silent for some time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand lay on the gate-post as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) balanced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own over it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart beat quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But did you--were you ever--did you ever give him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) a chance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chance? How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To come near to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I married him (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>)--and I was willing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both strove to keep their voices steady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) loves you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand away, and could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) by
removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) own. After a silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began again:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) out of count all along?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) left me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) couldn't MAKE himself mean everything to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) tried to bully me into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But the conversation had got them both out of their depth. Suddenly Paul
jumped down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let's go and get some tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They found a cottage, where they sat in the cold parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) poured out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was very quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had withdrawn again from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
After tea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stared broodingly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) tea-cup, twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wedding
ring all the time. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) abstraction she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) took the ring off her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) finger,
stood it up, and spun it upon the table. The gold became a diaphanous,
glittering globe. It fell, and the ring was quivering upon the table.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) spun it again and again. Paul watched, fascinated.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was a married woman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) believed in simple friendship. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was perfectly honourable with regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
It was only a friendship between man and woman, such as any civilised
persons might have.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was like so many young men of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own age. Sex had become so
complicated in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have denied that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever could want
Clara or Miriam or any woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew. Sex desire was a sort of
detached thing, that did not belong to a woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved Miriam with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew warm at the thought of Clara, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) battled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew the curves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast and shoulders as if they had been moulded
inside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not positively desire her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have
denied it for ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed himself really bound to Miriam. If ever
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should marry, some time in the far future, it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to
marry Miriam. That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave Clara to understand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said nothing,
but left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) courses. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), Mrs. Dawes, whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote frequently to Miriam, and visited the girl
occasionally. So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on through the winter; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed not so
fretted. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother was easier about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was getting
away from Miriam.

<p/>Miriam knew now how strong was the attraction of Clara for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but
still she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was certain that the best in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would triumph. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feeling
for Mrs. Dawes--who, moreover, was a married woman--was shallow and
temporal, compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love for herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sure; with some of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young freshness gone, perhaps, but cured
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire for the lesser things which other women than herself could
give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could bear all if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were inwardly true to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and must
come back.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw none of the anomaly of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position. Miriam was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old friend,
lover, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) belonged to Bestwood and home and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth. Clara was a
newer friend, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) belonged to Nottingham, to life, to the world. It
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite plain.

<p/>Mrs. Dawes and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had many periods of coolness, when they saw little of
each other; but they always came together again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you horrid with Baxter Dawes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). It was a thing that
seemed to trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know. But weren't you horrid with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)? Didn't you do
something that knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) to pieces?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, pray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Making him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) were nothing--I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so clever, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said coolly.

<p/>The conversation broke off there. But it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) cool with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for some
time.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) very rarely saw Miriam now. The friendship between the two women was
not broken off, but considerably weakened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come in to the concert on Sunday afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Clara asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
just after Christmas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised to go up to Willey Farm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Which almost annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Miriam and I have been a lot to each other ever
since I was sixteen--that's seven years now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Clara replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)--it doesn't go right--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>asked Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seems to draw me and draw me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wouldn't leave a single hair
of me free to fall out and blow away--she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)'d keep it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you like to be kept.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't. I wish it could be normal, give and take--like
me and you. I want a woman to keep me, but not in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), it couldn't be normal, like me and you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I should love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) better then. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sort of wants me so much that I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wants you how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wants the soul out of my body. I can't help shrinking back from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet you love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I never even kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Clara asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you're afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not. Something in me shrinks from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) like hell--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s so good,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do! I know she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants a sort of soul union.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how do you know what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for seven years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you haven't found out the very first thing about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't want any of your soul communion. That's your own
imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pondered over this. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seems--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've never tried,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.



<p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>THE TEST ON MIRIAM

<p/>WITH the spring came again the old madness and battle. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
would have to go to Miriam. But what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) reluctance? He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told himself
it was only a sort of overstrong virginity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) which neither
could break through. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might have married her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>); but his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) circumstances
at home made it difficult, and, moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not want to marry.
Marriage was for life, and because they had become close companions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not see that it should inevitably follow they should be
man and wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted marriage with Miriam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have given his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head to have felt a joyous desire
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Then why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bring it off? There
was some obstacle; and what was the obstacle? It lay in the physical
bondage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shrank from the physical contact. But why? With her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt
bound up inside himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not go out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Something struggled
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not get to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Why? She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Clara said she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
even wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); then why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), make love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), kiss
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)? Why, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), timidly, as they walked, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would burst forth in brutality and recoil? He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) owed himself to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Perhaps the recoil and the shrinking
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was love in its first fierce modesty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had no aversion for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). No, it was the opposite; it was a strong desire battling with a
still stronger shyness and virginity. It seemed as if virginity were a
positive force, which fought and won in both of them. And with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
felt it so hard to overcome; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
alone could he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) deliberately break through. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) owed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
Then, if they could get things right, they could marry; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not
marry unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could feel strong in the joy of it--never. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not
have faced his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that to sacrifice himself in
a marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not want would be degrading, and would undo all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
life, make it a nullity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would try what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) COULD do.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a great tenderness for Miriam. Always, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was sad, dreaming
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) religion; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was nearly a religion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not bear to
fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It would all come right if they tried.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked round. A good many of the nicest men he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew were like
himself, bound in by their own virginity, which they could not break
out of. They were so sensitive to their women that they would go without
them for ever rather than do them a hurt, an injustice. Being the sons
of mothers whose husbands had blundered rather brutally through their
feminine sanctities, they were themselves too diffident and shy. They
could easier deny themselves than incur any reproach from a woman; for
a woman was like their mother, and they were full of the sense of their
mother. They preferred themselves to suffer the misery of celibacy,
rather than risk the other person.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), brought
the tears almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) stood behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sang.
Annie was playing a song on the piano. As Miriam sang her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth seemed
hopeless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sang like a nun singing to heaven. It reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) so much
of the mouth and eyes of one who sings beside a Botticelli Madonna, so
spiritual. Again, hot as steel, came up the pain in him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). Why must he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) for the other thing? Why was there his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) blood battling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>)? If
only he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could have been always gentle, tender with her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>), breathing with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) the atmosphere of reverie and religious dreams, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would give
his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) right hand. It was not fair to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>). There seemed an eternal
maidenhood about her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saw the
great brown eyes of a maiden who was nearly scared and shocked out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) virgin maidenhood, but not quite, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) seven children.
They had been born almost leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) out of count, not of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>), but upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) could never let them go, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) never had possessed
them.

<p/>Mrs. Morel saw him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) going again frequently to Miriam, and was astonished.
He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said nothing to his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did not explain nor excuse himself. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came home late, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) frowned and turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
in an overbearing way:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come home when I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I am old enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) keep you till this time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I who stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lets you? But very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to bed, leaving the door unlocked for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lay
listening until he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came, often long after. It was a great bitterness
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had gone back to Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) recognised, however, the
uselessness of any further interference. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) went to Willey Farm as a
man now, not as a youth. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no right over him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). There was a coldness
between him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hardly told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anything. Discarded, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) waited
on him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), cooked for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) still, and loved to slave for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face
closed again like a mask. There was nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to do now but the
housework; for all the rest he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had gone to Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not forgive
him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). Miriam killed the joy and the warmth in him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had been such a
jolly lad, and full of the warmest affection; now he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) grew colder, more
and more irritable and gloomy. It reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) of William; but Paul was
worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did things with more intensity, and more realisation of what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was about. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother knew how he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was suffering for want of a woman,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) going to Miriam. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mind, nothing
on earth would alter him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Mrs. Morel was tired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) began to give up at
last; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had finished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was in the way.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went on determinedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) realised more or less what his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother felt.
It only hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made himself callous towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); but it
was like being callous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own health. It undermined him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) quickly; yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) persisted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lay back in the rocking-chair at Willey Farm one evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) had been
talking to Miriam for some weeks, but had not come to the point. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>)
said suddenly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am twenty-four, almost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had been brooding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) suddenly in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. What makes you say it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in the charged atmosphere that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dreaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas More says one can marry at twenty-four.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed quaintly, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it need Sir Thomas More's sanction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but one ought to marry about then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered broodingly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) waited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't marry you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) continued slowly, <div class="bookquote">``not now, because we've no
money, and they depend on me at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sat half-guessing what was coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I want to marry now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman--you know what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, at last, I must,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you ashamed of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't be ashamed
before your God, why are you before people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered deeply, <div class="bookquote">``I am not ashamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) replied bitterly; <div class="bookquote">``and it's my fault. But you know I can't
help being--as I am--don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love you an awful lot--then there is something short.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, in me! It is I who ought to be ashamed--like a spiritual cripple.
And I am ashamed. It is misery. Why is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>replied Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think we have been too
fierce in our what they call purity? Don't you think that to be so much
afraid and averse is a sort of dirtiness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) with startled dark eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You recoiled away from anything of the sort, and I took the motion from
you, and recoiled also, perhaps worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence in the room for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is between us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``all these years of intimacy. I feel
naked enough before you. Do you understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be bitter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) and was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) eyes were dark with
torture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>); it was worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) to have this
deflated love than for herself, who could never be properly mated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>)
was restless, for ever urging forward and trying to find a way out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>)
might do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) liked, and have what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) liked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said softly, <div class="bookquote">``I am not bitter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could bear anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would suffer for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) knee as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) leaned forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) took
it and kissed it; but it hurt to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) was putting himself
aside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) sat there sacrificed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) purity, which felt more like
nullity. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hand passionately, when it would drive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) away, and leave nothing but pain? Yet slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>They knew each other too well to pretend anything. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) eyes; they were staring across the room, with a peculiar
dark blaze in them that fascinated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) was perfectly still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) heart throbbing heavily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/>The blaze in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) eyes shuddered, became uncertain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking, all the while, I love you. I have been obstinate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sank her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) voice seemed sure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) mouth was
kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) throat.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head and looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) full gaze of
love. The blaze struggled, seemed to try to get away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and
then was quenched. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) head quickly aside. It was a moment of
anguish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kiss me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) whispered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) eyes, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) arms folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) closer and
closer.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) walked home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) over the fields, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad I came back to you. I feel so simple with you--as if there
was nothing to hide. We will be happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) murmured, and the tears came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some sort of perversity in our souls,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``makes us not want, get
away from, the very thing we want. We have to fight against that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt stunned.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood under the drooping-thorn tree, in the darkness by the
roadside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) fingers wandered over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face. In
the darkness, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) but only feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) passion
flooded him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) very close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometime you will have me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) murmured, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) face on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
shoulder. It was so difficult.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) hopes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) heart sunk. A dreariness came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) clasp of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) slackened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love to feel your arm THERE!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) arm against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
back, where it went round her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) waist. <div class="bookquote">``It rests me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) tightened the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) arm upon the small of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) back to rest
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We belong to each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why shouldn't we belong to each other altogether?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it's a lot to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but there's not much risk for you
really--not in the Gretchen way. You can trust me there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can trust you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The answer came quick and strong. <div class="bookquote">``It's not
that--it's not that at all--but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) neck with a little cry of misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed slightly hysterical, but with a sort of horror. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) heart
died in him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think it ugly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not now. You have TAUGHT me it isn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) calmed herself hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am only afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You should please yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) body stiff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You SHALL have me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shut teeth.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) heart beat up again like fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) close, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) mouth
was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) throat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not bear it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) drew away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) disengaged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you be late?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked gently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) sighed, scarcely hearing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) waited, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) would
go. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) quickly and climbed the fence. Looking round
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) saw the pale blotch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face down in the darkness under the
hanging tree. There was no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) but this pale blotch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) called softly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had no body, only a voice and a dim
face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) turned away and ran down the road, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) fists clenched; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) came to the wall over the lake he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) leaned there, almost stunned,
looking up the black water.

<p/>Miriam plunged home over the meadows. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was not afraid of people, what
they might say; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dreaded the issue with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>). Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) insisted; and then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought of it
afterwards, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart went down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) would be disappointed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) would find
no satisfaction, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) would go away. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) was so insistent; and
over this, which did not seem so all-important to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), was their love
to break down. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) was only like other men, seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>)
satisfaction. Oh, but there was something more in him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>), something deeper!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could trust to it, in spite of all desires. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) said that possession
was a great moment in life. All strong emotions concentrated there.
Perhaps it was so. There was something divine in it; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would
submit, religiously, to the sacrifice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) should have her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). And at
the thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) whole body clenched itself involuntarily, hard, as if
against something; but Life forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) through this gate of suffering,
too, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would submit. At any rate, it would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>)
wanted, which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) deepest wish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) brooded and brooded and brooded
herself towards accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Willey</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) courted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) now like a lover. Often, when he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) grew hot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>)
face from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), held it between her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands, and looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) eyes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) could not meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) gaze. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark eyes, full of love, earnest and
searching, made him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) turn away. Not for an instant would she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
forget. Back again he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) had to torture himself into a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
responsibility and hers. Never any relaxing, never any leaving himself
to the great hunger and impersonality of passion; he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) must be brought
back to a deliberate, reflective creature. As if from a swoon of passion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) caged him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) back to the littleness, the personal relationship. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
could not bear it. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone--leave me alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) wanted to cry;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) with eyes full of love. His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) eyes, full
of the dark, impersonal fire of desire, did not belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>There was a great crop of cherries at the farm. The trees at the back
of the house, very large and tall, hung thick with scarlet and crimson
drops, under the dark leaves. Paul and Edgar were gathering the fruit
one evening. It had been a hot day, and now the clouds were rolling in
the sky, dark and warm. Paul combed high in the tree, above the scarlet
roofs of the buildings. The wind, moaning steadily, made the whole tree
rock with a subtle, thrilling motion that stirred the blood. The young
man, perched insecurely in the slender branches, rocked till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt
slightly drunk, reached down the boughs, where the scarlet beady
cherries hung thick underneath, and tore off handful after handful of
the sleek, cool-fleshed fruit. Cherries touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stretched forward, their chill finger-tips sending a flash down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
blood. All shades of red, from a golden vermilion to a rich crimson,
glowed and met his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes under a darkness of leaves.

<p/>The sun, going down, suddenly caught the broken clouds. Immense piles of
gold flared out in the south-east, heaped in soft, glowing yellow right
up the sky. The world, till now dusk and grey, reflected the gold glow,
astonished. Everywhere the trees, and the grass, and the far-off water,
seemed roused from the twilight and shining.

<p/>Miriam came out wondering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mellow voice call, <div class="bookquote">``isn't it wonderful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked down. There was a faint gold glimmer on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face, that looked
very soft, turned up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How high you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>Beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), on the rhubarb leaves, were four dead birds, thieves that
had been shot. Paul saw some cherry stones hanging quite bleached, like
skeletons, picked clear of flesh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked down again to Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clouds are on fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed so small, so soft, so tender, down there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) threw a handful
of cherries at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was startled and frightened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed with a
low, chuckling sound, and pelted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) ran for shelter, picking
up some cherries. Two fine red pairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) ears; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
looked up again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you got enough?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly. It is like being on a ship up here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long will you stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``While the sunset lasts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went to the fence and sat there, watching the gold clouds fall to
pieces, and go in immense, rose-coloured ruin towards the darkness. Gold
flamed to scarlet, like pain in its intense brightness. Then the scarlet
sank to rose, and rose to crimson, and quickly the passion went out of
the sky. All the world was dark grey. Paul scrambled quickly down with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) basket, tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shirt-sleeve as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam, fingering the cherries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've torn my sleeve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) took the three-cornered rip, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to mend it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>It was near the shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fingers
through the tear. <div class="bookquote">``How warm!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed. There was a new, strange note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) voice, one that made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we stay out?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't it rain?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, let us walk a little way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went down the fields and into the thick plantation of trees and
pines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go in among the trees?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very dark among the firs, and the sharp spines pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was afraid. Paul was silent and strange.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like the darkness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I wish it were thicker--good, thick
darkness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed to be almost unaware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) as a person: she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was only to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
then a woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was afraid.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood against a pine-tree trunk and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
relinquished herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), but it was a sacrifice in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt
something of horror. This thick-voiced, oblivious man was a stranger to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>Later it began to rain. The pine-trees smelled very strong. Paul lay
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head on the ground, on the dead pine needles, listening to the
sharp hiss of the rain--a steady, keen noise. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart was down, very
heavy. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) realised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had not been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) all the time,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul had stood apart, in a sort of horror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was physically at
rest, but no more. Very dreary at heart, very sad, and very tender,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers wandered over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face pitifully. Now again she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
deeply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was tender and beautiful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rain!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--is it coming on you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands over him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hair, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulders, to feel if
the raindrops fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
face on the dead pine-leaves, felt extraordinarily quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not
mind if the raindrops came on him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have lain and got wet
through: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt as if nothing mattered, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) living were smeared
away into the beyond, near and quite lovable. This strange, gentle
reaching-out to death was new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered, but did not move.

<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) now, life seemed a shadow, day a white shadow; night, and death,
and stillness, and inaction, this seemed like BEING. To be alive, to be
urgent and insistent--that was NOT-TO-BE. The highest of all was to melt
out into the darkness and sway there, identified with the great Being.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rain is coming in on us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose, and assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To have to go. I feel so still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiller than I have ever been in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was walking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand in hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers, feeling
a slight fear. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had a fear lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) should
lose him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fir-trees are like presences on the darkness: each one only a
presence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was afraid, and said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A sort of hush: the whole night wondering and asleep: I suppose that's
what we do in death--sleep in wonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had been afraid before of the brute in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>): now of the mystic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
trod beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in silence. The rain fell with a heavy <div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>on the
trees. At last they gained the cartshed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us stay here awhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>There was a sound of rain everywhere, smothering everything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel so strange and still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``along with everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered patiently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed again unaware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hand close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be rid of our individuality, which is our will, which is our
effort--to live effortless, a kind of curious sleep--that is very
beautiful, I think; that is our after-life--our immortality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--and very beautiful to have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't usually say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In a while they went indoors. Everybody looked at them curiously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
still kept the quiet, heavy look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes, the stillness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
voice. Instinctively, they all left him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) alone.

<p/>About this time Miriam's grandmother, who lived in a tiny cottage in
Woodlinton, fell ill, and the girl was sent to keep house. It was a
beautiful little place. The cottage had a big garden in front, with
red brick walls, against which the plum trees were nailed. At the back
another garden was separated from the fields by a tall old hedge. It
was very pretty. Miriam had not much to do, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) found time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
beloved reading, and for writing little introspective pieces which
interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>At the holiday-time her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) grandmother, being better, was driven to Derby
to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) daughter for a day or two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was a crotchety old
lady, and might return the second day or the third; so Miriam stayed
alone in the cottage, which also pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>Paul used often to cycle over, and they had as a rule peaceful and happy
times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not embarrass her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) much; but then on the Monday of the
holiday he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was to spend a whole day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>It was perfect weather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
going. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be alone all the day. It cast a shadow over him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had three days that were all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was going to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
liked. It was sweet to rush through the morning lanes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bicycle.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got to the cottage at about eleven o'clock. Miriam was busy preparing
dinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked so perfectly in keeping with the little kitchen,
ruddy and busy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and sat down to watch. The room was small
and cosy. The sofa was covered all over with a sort of linen in squares
of red and pale blue, old, much washed, but pretty. There was a stuffed
owl in a case over a corner cupboard. The sunlight came through the
leaves of the scented geraniums in the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was cooking a chicken
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) honour. It was their cottage for the day, and they were man and
wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beat the eggs for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and peeled the potatoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
gave a feeling of home almost like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother; and no one could look
more beautiful, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tumbled curls, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was flushed from the
fire.

<p/>The dinner was a great success. Like a young husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) carved. They
talked all the time with unflagging zest. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wiped the dishes she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had washed, and they went out down the fields. There was a bright little
brook that ran into a bog at the foot of a very steep bank. Here
they wandered, picking still a few marsh-marigolds and many big blue
forget-me-nots. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat on the bank with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands full of flowers,
mostly golden water-blobs. As she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face down into the marigolds,
it was all overcast with a yellow shine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your face is bright,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``like a transfiguration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), questioning. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) laughed pleadingly to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), laying his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
hands on hers. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fingers, then her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face.

<p/>The world was all steeped in sunshine, and quite still, yet not asleep,
but quivering with a kind of expectancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never seen anything more beautiful than this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) held
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand fast all the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the water singing to itself as it runs--do you love it?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) full of love. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes were very dark, very bright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think it's a great day?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) murmured her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) assent. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) WAS happy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And our day--just between us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/>They lingered a little while. Then they stood up upon the sweet thyme,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked.

<p/>They went back to the house, hand in hand, in silence. The chickens came
scampering down the path to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) locked the door, and they had the
little house to themselves.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never forgot seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lay on the bed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
unfastening his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) collar. First he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw only her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beauty, and was blind
with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had the most beautiful body he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had ever imagined. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood
unable to move or speak, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face half-smiling with
wonder. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands
lifted in a little pleading movement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, and
stopped. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) big brown eyes were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), still and resigned and
loving; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lay as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had given herself up to sacrifice: there was
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) body for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); but the look at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes, like a creature
awaiting immolation, arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blood fell back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure you want me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked, as if a cold shadow had come over
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, quite sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was very quiet, very calm. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) only realised that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was doing
something for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could hardly bear it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lay to be sacrificed for
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) so much. And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). For a
second, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were sexless or dead. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shut his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes again
to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blood beat back again.

<p/>And afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to the last fibre of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) being.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted, somehow, to cry. There was something he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
could not bear for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) till quite late at
night. As he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rode home he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was finally initiated. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a
youth no longer. But why had he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the dull pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) soul? Why did the
thought of death, the after-life, seem so sweet and consoling?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spent the week with Miriam, and wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) out with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) passion before
it was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had always, almost wilfully, to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) out of count,
and act from the brute strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own feelings. And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not do
it often, and there remained afterwards always the sense of failure and
of death. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were really with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to put aside himself and
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) desire. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I come to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes dark with pain and shame,
<div class="bookquote">``you don't really want me, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied quickly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) began to tremble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face and shutting it out against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
shoulder--<div class="bookquote">``you see--as we are--how can I get used to you? It would come
all right if we were married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean, now, it is always too much shock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are always clenched against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was trembling with agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not used to the thought--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/>``But all my life. Mother said to me: ``There is one thing in marriage
that is always dreadful, but you have to bear it.<div class="bookquote">'' And I believed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And still believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried hastily. <div class="bookquote">``I believe, as you do, that loving, even in
THAT way, is the high-water mark of living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't alter the fact that you never want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) arms and rocking in despair.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't say so! You don't understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rocked with pain. <div class="bookquote">``Don't I
want your children?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say so? But we must be married to have children--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we be married, then? I want you to have my children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hand reverently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pondered sadly, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are too young,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said at length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-four and twenty-three--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pleaded, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rocked herself in distress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head gravely. The tone of hopelessness in which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said
these things grieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) deeply. It had always been a failure between
them. Tacitly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) acquiesced in what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt.

<p/>And after a week of love he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother suddenly one Sunday
night, just as they were going to bed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't go so much to Miriam's, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was surprised, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You please yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went to bed. But there was a new quietness about him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had wondered at. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) almost guessed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) alone, however.
Precipitation might spoil things. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loneliness,
wondering where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would end. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was sick, and much too quiet for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
There was a perpetual little knitting of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brows, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had seen
when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a small baby, and which had been gone for many years. Now
it was the same again. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could do nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to go on
alone, make his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own way.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) continued faithful to Miriam. For one day he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) utterly.
But it never came again. The sense of failure grew stronger. At first it
was only a sadness. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) began to feel he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not go on. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted
to run, to go abroad, anything. Gradually he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ceased to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) to have
him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>). Instead of drawing them together, it put them apart. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
realised, consciously, that it was no good. It was useless trying: it
would never be a success between them.

<p/>For some months he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) had seen very little of Clara. They had occasionally
walked out for half an hour at dinner-time. But he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) always reserved
himself for Miriam. With Clara, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) brow cleared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>)
was gay again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) treated him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) indulgently, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) were a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) did not mind. But deep below the surface it piqued him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>).

<p/>Sometimes Miriam said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about Clara? I hear nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) about twenty minutes yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) talk about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I suppose I did all the jawing--I usually do. I think I
was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) about the strike, and how the women took it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) gave the account of himself.

<p/>But insidiously, without his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) knowing it, the warmth he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) felt for Clara
drew him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) away from Miriam, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) felt responsible, and to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
felt he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) belonged. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) was being quite faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It was
not easy to estimate exactly the strength and warmth of one's feelings
for a woman till they have run away with one.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) began to give more time to his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) men friends. There was Jessop, at the
art school; Swain, who was chemistry demonstrator at the university;
Newton, who was a teacher; besides Edgar and Miriam's younger brothers.
Pleading work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) sketched and studied with Jessop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) called in the
university for Swain, and the two went <div class="bookquote">``down town''  (<font color='red'><b>Swain</b></font>)</div>together. Having come
home in the train with Newton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) called and had a game of billiards
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) in the Moon and Stars. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) gave to Miriam the excuse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>)
men friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) felt quite justified. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mother began to be relieved.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) always told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) had been.

<p/>During the summer Clara wore sometimes a dress of soft cotton stuff with
loose sleeves. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hands, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sleeves fell back, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
beautiful strong arms shone out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Hold your arm still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) made sketches of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand and arm, and the drawings contained some
of the fascination the real thing had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>). Miriam, who always went
scrupulously through his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) books and papers, saw the drawings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Clara has such beautiful arms,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! When did you draw them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On Tuesday, in the work-room. You know, I've got a corner where I can
work. Often I can do every single thing they need in the department,
before dinner. Then I work for myself in the afternoon, and just see to
things at night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, turning the leaves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) sketch-book.

<p/>Frequently he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) hated Miriam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bent forward and pored
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) way of patiently casting him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) up, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>)
were an endless psychological account. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) hated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) for having got him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>), and yet not got him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
took all and gave nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) said. At least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) gave no living warmth.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was never alive, and giving off life. Looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was like
looking for something which did not exist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was only his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) conscience,
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) violently, and was more cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). They
dragged on till the next summer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) saw more and more of Clara.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) had been sitting working at home one evening. There
was between him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mother a peculiar condition of people frankly
finding fault with each other. Mrs. Morel was strong on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) feet again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) was not going to stick to Miriam. Very well; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would stand
aloof till he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) said something. It had been coming a long time, this
bursting of the storm in him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) would come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). This
evening there was between them a peculiar condition of suspense.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) worked feverishly and mechanically, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) could escape from
himself. It grew late. Through the open door, stealthily, came the scent
of madonna lilies, almost as if it were prowling abroad. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) got
up and went out of doors.

<p/>The beauty of the night made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) want to shout. A half-moon, dusky gold,
was sinking behind the black sycamore at the end of the garden, making
the sky dull purple with its glow. Nearer, a dim white fence of lilies
went across the garden, and the air all round seemed to stir with scent,
as if it were alive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) went across the bed of pinks, whose keen perfume
came sharply across the rocking, heavy scent of the lilies, and stood
alongside the white barrier of flowers. They flagged all loose, as if
they were panting. The scent made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) drunk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) went down to the field
to watch the moon sink under.

<p/>A corncrake in the hay-close called insistently. The moon slid quite
quickly downwards, growing more flushed. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) the great flowers
leaned as if they were calling. And then, like a shock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) caught
another perfume, something raw and coarse. Hunting round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) found
the purple iris, touched their fleshy throats and their dark, grasping
hands. At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) had found something. They stood stiff in the
darkness. Their scent was brutal. The moon was melting down upon the
crest of the hill. It was gone; all was dark. The corncrake called
still.

<p/>Breaking off a pink, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) suddenly went indoors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure it's time you went to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) stood with the pink against his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall break off with Miriam, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) answered calmly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spectacles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) was staring back at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
unswerving. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) eyes for a moment, then took off her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) glasses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>)
was white. The male was up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>), dominant. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>)
too clearly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). I don't want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)--so I
shall have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mother, amazed, <div class="bookquote">``I thought lately you had made up
your mind to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and so I said nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had--I wanted to--but now I don't want. It's no good. I shall break
off on Sunday. I ought to, oughtn't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know best. You know I said so long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help that now. I shall break off on Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mother, ``I think it will be best. But lately I decided
you had made up your mind to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), so I said nothing, and should
have said nothing. But I say as I have always said, I DON<div class="bookquote">``T think she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) is
suited to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On Sunday I break off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) said, smelling the pink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) put the flower
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mouth. Unthinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) teeth, closed them on the blossom
slowly, and had a mouthful of petals. These he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) spat into the fire,
kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mother, and went to bed.

<p/>On Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) went up to the farm in the early afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) had written
Miriam that they would walk over the fields to Hucknall. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) mother was
very tender with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) said nothing. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw the effort it was
costing. The peculiar set look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) face stilled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You will be so much better when it is
all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul glanced swiftly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother in surprise and resentment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did
not want sympathy.

<p/>Miriam met him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) at the lane-end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was wearing a new dress of figured
muslin that had short sleeves. Those short sleeves, and Miriam's
brown-skinned arms beneath them--such pitiful, resigned arms--gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
so much pain that they helped to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cruel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had made herself
look so beautiful and fresh for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed to blossom for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
alone. Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)--a mature young woman now, and
beautiful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) new dress--it hurt so much that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart seemed almost
to be bursting with the restraint he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put on it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had decided, and
it was irrevocable.

<p/>On the hills they sat down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lap, whilst
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fingered his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was not there,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) put it.
Often, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and could not find
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). But this afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was not prepared.

<p/>It was nearly five o'clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). They were sitting on the
bank of a stream, where the lip of turf hung over a hollow bank of
yellow earth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was hacking away with a stick, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) did when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
was perturbed and cruel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we ought to break off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it's no good going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it no good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't. I don't want to marry. I don't want ever to marry. And if
we're not going to marry, it's no good going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do you say this now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I've made up my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about these last months, and the things you told me then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it! I don't want to go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want any more of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want us to break off--you be free of me, I free of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about these last months?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I've not told you anything but what I thought was true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why are you different now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not--I'm the same--only I know it's no good going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't told me why it's no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I don't want to go on--and I don't want to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many times have you offered to marry me, and I wouldn't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know; but I want us to break off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence for a moment or two, while he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) dug viciously at the
earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head, pondering. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was an unreasonable child. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
was like an infant which, when it has drunk its fill, throws away and
smashes the cup. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
and WRING some consistency out of him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was helpless. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
cried:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said you were only fourteen--you are only FOUR!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) still dug at the earth viciously. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a child of four,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) repeated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) anger.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) did not answer, but said in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heart: <div class="bookquote">``All right; if I'm a child of
four, what do you want me for? I don't want another mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said
nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and there was silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you told your people?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another long interval of silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what do you WANT?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I want us to separate. We have lived on each other all these
years; now let us stop. I will go my own way without you, and you will
go your way without me. You will have an independent life of your own
then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was in it some truth that, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bitterness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could
not help registering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) felt in a sort of bondage to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>),
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hated because she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not control it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) love for
him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) from the moment it grew too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). And, deep down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had
hated him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) dominated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had resisted
his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) domination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had fought to keep herself free of him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) in the last
issue. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was free of him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), even more than he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``we shall always be more or less each other's work.
You have done a lot for me, I for you. Now let us start and live by
ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing--only to be free,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), however, knew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart that Clara's influence was over him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) to
liberate him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have I to tell my mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``that I was breaking off--clean and
altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not tell them at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>Frowning, <div class="bookquote">``You please yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had landed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in a nasty hole, and was leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) in the
lurch. It angered him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell them you wouldn't and won't marry me, and have broken off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``It's true enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) finger moodily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought over their whole affair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had
known it would come to this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had seen it all along. It chimed with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bitter expectation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always--it has always been so!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It has been one long battle
between us--you fighting away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) unawares, like a flash of lightning. The man's heart
stood still. Was this how she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw it?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we've had SOME perfect hours, SOME perfect times, when we were
together!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``never! It has always been you fighting me off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always--not at first!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always, from the very beginning--always the same!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had finished, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had done enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat aghast. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wanted
to say: <div class="bookquote">``It has been good, but it is at an end.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) whose love
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had believed in when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had despised himself--denied that their love
had ever been love. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had always fought away from her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then it had
been monstrous. There had never been anything really between them; all
the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been imagining something where there was nothing. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had known. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had known so much, and had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
had known all the time. All the time this was at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat silent in bitterness. At last the whole affair appeared in a
cynical aspect to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had really played with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), not he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had hidden all her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) condemnation from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), had flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
despised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) despised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew intellectual and cruel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to marry a man who worships you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``then you could do
as you liked with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Plenty of men will worship you, if you get on the
private side of their natures. You ought to marry one such. They would
never fight you off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But don't advise me to marry someone else any
more. You've done it before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I will say no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat still, feeling as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had a blow, instead of giving one.
Their eight years of friendship and love, THE eight years of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life,
were nullified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did you think of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought definitely on Thursday night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it was coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said.

<p/>That pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well! If she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) knew then it doesn't
come as a surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you said anything to Clara?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I shall tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember the things you said this time last year, in my
grandmother's house--nay last month even?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I do! And I meant them! I can't help that it's failed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has failed because you want something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have failed whether or not. YOU never believed in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) laughed strangely.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat in silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was full of a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had despised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
say wrong things, and had not contradicted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fight
alone. But it stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had despised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) should have told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) found
fault with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had not played fair. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). All these years
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were a hero, and thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) secretly as
an infant, a foolish child. Then why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) left the foolish child to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) folly? His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was hard against her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sat full of bitterness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had known--oh, well she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had known!
All the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had summed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up, seen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
littleness, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meanness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) folly. Even she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had guarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) soul
against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was not overthrown, not prostrated, not even much hurt.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had known. Only why, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat there, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still this strange
dominance over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)? His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very movements fascinated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) were
hypnotised by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was despicable, false, inconsistent, and mean.
Why this bondage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)? Why was it the movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
as nothing else in the world could? Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) fastened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Why,
even now, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) and commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>), would she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) have to obey?
She (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) would obey him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trifling commands. But once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obeyed,
then she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) power, she (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) knew, to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) would.
She (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) was sure of herself. Only, this new influence! Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not a man!
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a baby that cries for the newest toy. And all the attachment
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul would not keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Very well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have to go. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would come back when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new sensation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hacked at the earth till she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) was fretted to death. She (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) rose. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat
flinging lumps of earth in the stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go and have tea here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) answered.

<p/>They chattered over irrelevant subjects during tea. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held forth on
the love of ornament--the cottage parlour moved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thereto--and its
connection with aesthetics. She (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) was cold and quiet. As they walked home,
she (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) asked:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we shall not see each other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--or rarely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor write?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) asked, almost sarcastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``We're not strangers--never should be,
whatever happened. I will write to you now and again. You please
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) answered cuttingly.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at that stage at which nothing else hurts. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made a
great cleavage in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had a great shock when she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) their love had been always a conflict. Nothing more mattered. If it
never had been much, there was no need to make a fuss that it was ended.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) at the lane-end. As she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) went home, solitary, in her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) new
frock, having her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) people to face at the other end, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood still with
shame and pain in the highroad, thinking of the suffering he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caused her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>).

<p/>In the reaction towards restoring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) self-esteem, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into the
Willow Tree for a drink. There were four girls who had been out for the
day, drinking a modest glass of port. They had some chocolates on the
table. Paul sat near with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whisky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) noticed the girls whispering
and nudging. Presently one, a bonny dark hussy, leaned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have a chocolate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The others laughed loudly at her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) impudence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``Give me a hard one--nut. I don't like creams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl; <div class="bookquote">``here's an almond for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) held the sweet between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) popped
it in, and blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ARE nice!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``we thought you looked overcast, and they dared me
offer you a chocolate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind if I have another--another sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>And presently they were all laughing together.

<p/>It was nine o'clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got home, falling dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) entered the house
in silence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, who had been waiting, rose anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>replied the mother, with great relief.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cap wearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said we'd have done altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother. <div class="bookquote">``It's hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now, but
best in the long run. I know. You weren't suited for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed shakily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had such a lark with some girls in a pub,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had forgotten Miriam now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
about the girls in the Willow Tree. Mrs. Morel looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). It seemed
unreal, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gaiety. At the back of it was too much horror and misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now have some supper,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said very gently.

<p/>Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said wistfully:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never thought she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d have me, mother, not from the first, and so
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) doesn't give up hopes of you yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find it's better to have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said desperately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, leave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
alone. Very few people cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for very few people. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
remained alone with herself, waiting.



<p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>PASSION

<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was gradually making it possible to earn a livelihood by his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) art.
Liberty's had taken several of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) painted designs on various stuffs,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could sell designs for embroideries, for altar-cloths, and
similar things, in one or two places. It was not very much he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made
at present, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might extend it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had also made friends with the
designer for a pottery firm, and was gaining some knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) new
acquaintance's art. The applied arts interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) very much. At the
same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laboured slowly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pictures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved to paint large
figures, full of light, but not merely made up of lights and cast
shadows, like the impressionists; rather definite figures that had a
certain luminous quality, like some of Michael Angelo's people. And
these he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) fitted into a landscape, in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) thought true proportion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) worked a great deal from memory, using everybody he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) believed
firmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) work, that it was good and valuable. In spite of fits of
depression, shrinking, everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) work.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) was twenty-four when he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) first confident thing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I s'll make a painter that they'll attend to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sniffed in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) quaint fashion. It was like a half-pleased shrug of
the shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my boy, we'll see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall see, my pigeon! You see if you're not swanky one of these
days!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm quite content, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll have to alter. Look at you with Minnie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Minnie</b></font>)</div><p/>Minnie was the small servant, a girl of fourteen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about Minnie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Morel, with dignity.

<p/>``I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) this morning: ``Eh, Mrs. Morel! I was going to do that,<div class="bookquote">''
when you went out in the rain for some coal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That looks a lot
like your being able to manage servants!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was only the child's niceness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>``And you apologising to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``You can't do two things at once, can
you?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) WAS busy washing up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Morel.

<p/>``And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) say? <div class="bookquote">``It could easy have waited a bit. Now look how
your feet paddle!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--brazen young baggage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, smiling.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mother, laughing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was quite warm and rosy again
with love of him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). It seemed as if all the sunshine were on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) for a
moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) work gladly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) seemed so well when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
happy that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) grey hair.

<p/>And that year she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to the Isle of Wight for a holiday. It
was too exciting for them both, and too beautiful. Mrs. Morel was full
of joy and wonder. But he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was able. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had a bad fainting bout. So grey her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face was, so blue her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
mouth! It was agony to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) felt as if someone were pushing a knife
in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) chest. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was better again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) forgot. But the anxiety
remained inside him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), like a wound that did not close.

<p/>After leaving Miriam he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went almost straight to Clara. On the Monday
following the day of the rupture he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went down to the work-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) and smiled. They had grown very intimate unawares. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
saw a new brightness about him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Queen of Sheba!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it suits you. You've got a new frock on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) flushed, asking:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suits you--awfully! I could design you a dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How would it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) stood in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) eyes glittering as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) expounded. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes fixed with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
half-started back. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) drew the stuff of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) blouse tighter, smoothed it
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More SO!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) explained.

<p/>But they were both of them flaming with blushes, and immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
ran away. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) whole body was quivering with the
sensation.

<p/>There was already a sort of secret understanding between them. The next
evening he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went to the cinematograph with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) for a few minutes before
train-time. As they sat, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand lying near him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). For some
moments he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) dared not touch it. The pictures danced and dithered. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). It was large and firm; it filled his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) grasp. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
held it fast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) neither moved nor made any sign. When they came out
his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) train was due. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) darted away across the road.

<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) came again, talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was rather superior with
him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go a walk on Monday?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you tell Miriam?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied sarcastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have broken off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Last Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You quarrelled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I had made up my mind. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) quite definitely I should
consider myself free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara did not answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was so quiet and
so superb!

<p/>On the Saturday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to come and drink coffee with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
in a restaurant, meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) after work was over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) came, looking
very reserved and very distant. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had three-quarters of an hour to
train-time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will walk a little while,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) agreed, and they went past the Castle into the Park. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was afraid
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked moodily at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) side, with a kind of resentful,
reluctant, angry walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was afraid to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which way shall we go?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) asked as they walked in darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we'll go up the steps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) suddenly turned round. They had passed the Park steps. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood
still in resentment at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) suddenly abandoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) looked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood aloof. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) suddenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) arms, held her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) strained
for a moment, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, penitent.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) finger-tips. They went
in silence. When they came to the light, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) let go her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand. Neither
spoke till they reached the station. Then they looked each other in the
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) train. His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) body acted mechanically. People talked to
him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) heard faint echoes answering them. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was in a delirium. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would go mad if Monday did not come at once. On Monday he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) again. All himself was pitched there, ahead. Sunday intervened.
He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could not bear it. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) till Monday. And Sunday
intervened--hour after hour of tension. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wanted to beat his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) head
against the door of the carriage. But he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sat still. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) drank some whisky
on the way home, but it only made it worse. His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mother must not be
upset, that was all. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) dissembled, and got quickly to bed. There he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
sat, dressed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knees, staring out of the window at
the far hill, with its few lights. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) neither thought nor slept, but sat
perfectly still, staring. And when at last he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was so cold that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) came
to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) watch had stopped at half-past two. It was
after three o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was exhausted, but still there was the torment
of knowing it was only Sunday morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went to bed and slept. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
cycled all day long, till he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was fagged out. And he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) scarcely knew where
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had been. But the day after was Monday. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) slept till four o'clock.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) lay and thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was coming nearer to himself--he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could see
himself, real, somewhere in front. She (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would go a walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in the
afternoon. Afternoon! It seemed years ahead.

<p/>Slowly the hours crawled. His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) father got up; he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) pottering
about. Then the miner set off to the pit, his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) heavy boots scraping the
yard. Cocks were still crowing. A cart went down the road. His (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) mother
got up. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knocked the fire. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) softly. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
answered as if he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) were asleep. This shell of himself did well.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) was walking to the station--another mile! The train was near
Nottingham. Would it stop before the tunnels? But it did not matter; it
would get there before dinner-time. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) was at Jordan's. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
come in half an hour. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be near. He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) had done
the letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be there. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not come. He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) ran
downstairs. Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) through the glass door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulders
stooping a little to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) work made him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) feel he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) could not go forward; he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>)
could not stand. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) went in. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) was pale, nervous, awkward, and quite
cold. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) misunderstand him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) could not write his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) real self with
this shell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) struggled to say. <div class="bookquote">``You will come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied, murmuring.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), unable to say a word. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face from him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>).
Again came over him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) the feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) would lose consciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) set
his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) teeth and went upstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) had done everything correctly yet, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) would do so. All the morning things seemed a long way off, as they
do to a man under chloroform. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself seemed under a tight band
of constraint. Then there was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other self, in the distance, doing
things, entering stuff in a ledger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched that far-off him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
carefully to see he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made no mistake.

<p/>But the ache and strain of it could not go on much longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked
incessantly. Still it was only twelve o'clock. As if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nailed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
clothing against the desk, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood there and worked, forcing every
stroke out of himself. It was a quarter to one; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could clear away.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will meet me at the Fountain at two o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't be there till half-past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dark, mad eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try at a quarter past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to be content. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went and got some dinner. All the time
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still under chloroform, and every minute was stretched out
indefinitely. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked miles of streets. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be
late at the meeting-place. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at the Fountain at five past two. The
torture of the next quarter of an hour was refined beyond expression. It
was the anguish of combining the living self with the shell. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came! And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only five minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd never have done it to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in a dark blue costume. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beautiful figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want some flowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, going to the nearest florist's.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bought her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a bunch of scarlet, brick-red
carnations. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put them in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, flushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a fine colour!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather have had something softer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel like a blot of vermilion walking down the street?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hung her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, afraid of the people they met. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked sideways at
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as they walked. There was a wonderful close down on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face near
the ear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to touch. And a certain heaviness, the heaviness
of a very full ear of corn that dips slightly in the wind, that there
was about her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain spin. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be spinning down the
street, everything going round.

<p/>As they sat in the tramcar, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavy shoulder against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt himself coming round from the anaesthetic,
beginning to breathe. Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ear, half-hidden among her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blonde hair, was
near to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The temptation to kiss it was almost too great. But there
were other people on top of the car. It still remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to kiss
it. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was some attribute of hers, like
the sunshine that fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked quickly away. It had been raining. The big bluff of the Castle
rock was streaked with rain, as it reared above the flat of the town.
They crossed the wide, black space of the Midland Railway, and passed
the cattle enclosure that stood out white. Then they ran down sordid
Wilford Road.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rocked slightly to the tram's motion, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaned against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>), rocked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>) was a vigorous, slender man, with exhaustless
energy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>) face was rough, with rough-hewn features, like the common
people's; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>) eyes under the deep brows were so full of life that
they fascinated her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They seemed to dance, and yet they were still
trembling on the finest balance of laughter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>) mouth the same was just
going to spring into a laugh of triumph, yet did not. There was a sharp
suspense about him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip moodily. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>) hand was hard clenched
over hers.

<p/>They paid their two halfpennies at the turnstile and crossed the bridge.
The Trent was very full. It swept silent and insidious under the bridge,
travelling in a soft body. There had been a great deal of rain. On the
river levels were flat gleams of flood water. The sky was grey, with
glisten of silver here and there. In Wilford churchyard the dahlias were
sodden with rain--wet black-crimson balls. No one was on the path that
went along the green river meadow, along the elm-tree colonnade.

<p/>There was the faintest haze over the silvery-dark water and the green
meadow-bank, and the elm-trees that were spangled with gold. The river
slid by in a body, utterly silent and swift, intertwining among itself
like some subtle, complex creature. Clara walked moodily beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked at length, in rather a jarring tone, <div class="bookquote">``did you leave
Miriam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>) frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I WANTED to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I didn't want to go on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). And I didn't want to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was silent for a moment. They picked their way down the muddy path.
Drops of water fell from the elm-trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't want to marry Miriam, or you didn't want to marry at all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Both,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilford</b></font>) answered--<div class="bookquote">``both!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They had to manoeuvre to get to the stile, because of the pools of
water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Clara asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miriam? She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said I was a baby of four, and that I always HAD battled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara pondered over this for a time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have really been going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) for some time?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now you don't want any more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I know it's no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) pondered again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think you've treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) rather badly?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I ought to have dropped it years back. But it would have been no
good going on. Two wrongs don't make a right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old ARE you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Clara asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am thirty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be thirty-one--or AM I thirty-one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I neither know nor care. What does it matter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were at the entrance to the Grove. The wet, red track, already
sticky with fallen leaves, went up the steep bank between the grass.
On either side stood the elm-trees like pillars along a great aisle,
arching over and making high up a roof from which the dead leaves fell.
All was empty and silent and wet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood on top of the stile, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
held both her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hands. Laughing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
leaped. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast came against his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face
with kisses.

<p/>They went on up the slippery, steep red path. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) released his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
hand and put it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You press the vein in my arm, holding it so tightly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/>They walked along. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) finger-tips felt the rocking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast. All
was silent and deserted. On the left the red wet plough-land showed
through the doorways between the elm-boles and their branches. On the
right, looking down, they could see the tree-tops of elms growing far
beneath them, hear occasionally the gurgle of the river. Sometimes
there below they caught glimpses of the full, soft-sliding Trent, and of
water-meadows dotted with small cattle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has scarcely altered since little Kirke White used to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>)
said.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) throat below the ear, where the flush was
fusing into the honey-white, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mouth that pouted disconsolate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
stirred against him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) body was like a taut string.

<p/>Halfway up the big colonnade of elms, where the Grove rose highest above
the river, their forward movement faltered to an end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) across
to the grass, under the trees at the edge of the path. The cliff of red
earth sloped swiftly down, through trees and bushes, to the river that
glimmered and was dark between the foliage. The far-below water-meadows
were very green. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood leaning against one another, silent,
afraid, their bodies touching all along. There came a quick gurgle from
the river below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) asked at length, <div class="bookquote">``did you hate Baxter Dawes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) with a splendid movement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mouth was offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) throat; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes were half-shut; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast was tilted as if it
asked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) flashed with a small laugh, shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) eyes, and met
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in a long, whole kiss. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mouth fused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>); their bodies were
sealed and annealed. It was some minutes before they withdrew. They were
standing beside the public path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you go down to the river?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>), leaving herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) went over the brim
of the declivity and began to climb down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is slippery,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/>The red clay went down almost sheer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) slid, went from one tuft
of grass to the next, hanging on to the bushes, making for a little
platform at the foot of a tree. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), laughing with
excitement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shoes were clogged with red earth. It was hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) frowned. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>). The
cliff rose above them and fell away below. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) colour was up, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes
flashed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) looked at the big drop below them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's risky,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``or messy, at any rate. Shall we go back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for my sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. You see, I can't help you; I should only hinder. Give me
that little parcel and your gloves. Your poor shoes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They stood perched on the face of the declivity, under the trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll go again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) said.

<p/>Away he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) went, slipping, staggering, sliding to the next tree, into which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) fell with a slam that nearly shook the breath out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
came after cautiously, hanging on to the twigs and grasses. So they
descended, stage by stage, to the river's brink. There, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) disgust,
the flood had eaten away the path, and the red decline ran straight into
the water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) dug in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) heels and brought himself up violently. The
string of the parcel broke with a snap; the brown parcel bounded down,
leaped into the water, and sailed smoothly away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) hung on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll be damned!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) cried crossly. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) laughed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) was
coming perilously down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) back to the tree, waiting.
<div class="bookquote">``Come now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) called, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) arms.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) let herself run. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>), and together they stood watching the
dark water scoop at the raw edge of the bank. The parcel had sailed out
of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) close and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>). There was only room for their four
feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a swindle!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But there's a rut where a man has been, so
if we go on I guess we shall find the path again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The river slid and twined its great volume. On the other bank cattle
were feeding on the desolate flats. The cliff rose high above Paul and
Clara on their right hand. They stood against the tree in the watery
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us try going forward,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; and they struggled in the red
clay along the groove a man's nailed boots had made. They were hot and
flushed. Their barkled shoes hung heavy on their steps. At last they
found the broken path. It was littered with rubble from the water, but
at any rate it was easier. They cleaned their boots with twigs. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
heart was beating thick and fast.

<p/>Suddenly, coming on to the little level, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw two figures of men
standing silent at the water's edge. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart leaped. They were
fishing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned and put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand up warningly to Clara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
hesitated, buttoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) coat. The two went on together.

<p/>The fishermen turned curiously to watch the two intruders on their
privacy and solitude. They had had a fire, but it was nearly out. All
kept perfectly still. The men turned again to their fishing, stood
over the grey glinting river like statues. Clara went with bowed head,
flushing; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was laughing to himself. Directly they passed out of sight
behind the willows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now they ought to be drowned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul softly.

<p/>Clara did not answer. They toiled forward along a tiny path on the
river's lip. Suddenly it vanished. The bank was sheer red solid clay
in front of them, sloping straight into the river. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) stood and cursed
beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) breath, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) stood erect, looking round. Just ahead were two islets in the stream,
covered with osiers. But they were unattainable. The cliff came down
like a sloping wall from far above their heads. Behind, not far back,
were the fishermen. Across the river the distant cattle fed silently
in the desolate afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) cursed again deeply under his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
gazed up the great steep bank. Was there no hope but to scale back to
the public path?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said, and, digging his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heels sideways into the steep
bank of red clay, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) began nimbly to mount. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) looked across at every
tree-foot. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) found what he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) wanted. Two beech-trees side by side
on the hill held a little level on the upper face between their roots.
It was littered with damp leaves, but it would do. The fishermen were
perhaps sufficiently out of sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) rainproof and waved
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) to come.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) toiled to his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) side. Arriving there, she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heavily,
dumbly, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) looked
round. They were safe enough from all but the small, lonely cows over
the river. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sunk his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) mouth on her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) throat, where he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heavy
pulse beat under his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) lips. Everything was perfectly still. There was
nothing in the afternoon but themselves.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) arose, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), looking on the ground all the time, saw suddenly
sprinkled on the black wet beech-roots many scarlet carnation petals,
like splashed drops of blood; and red, small splashes fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
bosom, streaming down her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) dress to her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your flowers are smashed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heavily as she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) put back her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) hair. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
finger-tips on her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why dost look so heavy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) smiled sadly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) felt alone in herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) caressed her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) cheek
with his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) fingers, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Never thee bother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) fingers tight, and laughed shakily. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) put the hair back from her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) brows, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) temples, kissing
them lightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But tha shouldna worrit!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said softly, pleading.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't worry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) laughed tenderly and resigned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yea, tha does! Dunna thee worrit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) implored, caressing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>).

<p/>They had a stiff climb to get to the top again. It took them a quarter
of an hour. When he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) got on to the level grass, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) threw off his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) cap,
wiped the sweat from his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) forehead, and sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we're back at the ordinary level,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sat down, panting, on the tussocky grass. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) cheeks were flushed
pink. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) gave way to joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I'll clean thy boots and make thee fit for respectable folk,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) kneeled at her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) feet, worked away with a stick and tufts of grass. She (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
put her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) hair, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) head to her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), and kissed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I supposed to be doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) laughing;
<div class="bookquote">``cleaning shoes or dibbling with love? Answer me that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just whichever I please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm your boot-boy for the time being, and nothing else!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But they
remained looking into each other's eyes and laughing. Then they kissed
with little nibbling kisses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``T-t-t-t!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) went with his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) tongue, like his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you,
nothing gets done when there's a woman about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) boot-cleaning, singing softly. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
thick hair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) worked away at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoes. At
last they were quite presentable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are, you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Aren't I a great hand at restoring
you to respectability? Stand up! There, you look as irreproachable as
Britannia herself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) cleaned his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) own boots a little, washed his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) hands in a puddle, and
sang. They went on into Clifton village. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) was madly in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>);
every movement she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made, every crease in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) garments, sent a hot flash
through him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) and seemed adorable.

<p/>The old lady at whose house they had tea was roused into gaiety by them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could wish you'd had something of a better day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, hovering
round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``We've been saying how nice it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) curiously. There was a peculiar glow
and charm about him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) eyes were dark and laughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>)
moustache with a glad movement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been saying SO!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exclaimed, a light rousing in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) old
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'm sure the day's good enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fussed about, and did not want to leave them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether you'd like some radishes as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to
Clara; <div class="bookquote">``but I've got some in the garden--AND a cucumber.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara flushed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked very handsome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like some radishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.

<p/>And the old lady pottered off gleefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) knew!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara quietly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) doesn't know; and it shows we're nice in ourselves, at any
rate. You look quite enough to satisfy an archangel, and I'm sure I feel
harmless--so--if it makes you look nice, and makes folk happy when they
have us, and makes us happy--why, we're not cheating them out of much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went on with the meal. When they were going away, the old lady came
timidly with three tiny dahlias in full blow, neat as bees, and speckled
scarlet and white. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood before Clara, pleased with herself, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether--''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>and holding the flowers forward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) old
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>cried Clara, accepting the flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) have them all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul reproachfully of the old woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) shall have them all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied, beaming with joy. <div class="bookquote">``You have
got enough for your share.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I shall ask her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) to give me one!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) teased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) does as she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) pleases,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, smiling. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
bobbed a little curtsey of delight.

<p/>Clara was rather quiet and uncomfortable. As they walked along, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't feel criminal, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with startled grey eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Criminal!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you seem to feel you have done a wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said. ``I only think, <div class="bookquote">``If they knew!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they knew, they'd cease to understand. As it is, they do understand,
and they like it. What do they matter? Here, with only the trees and me,
you don't feel not the least bit wrong, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) by the arm, held her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).
Something fretted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not sinners, are we?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, with an uneasy little frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like your little bit of guiltiness, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I believe
Eve enjoyed it, when she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) went cowering out of Paradise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was a certain glow and quietness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) glad.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was alone in the railway-carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found himself tumultuously
happy, and the people exceedingly nice, and the night lovely, and
everything good.

<p/>Mrs. Morel was sitting reading when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) health was not good
now, and there had come that ivory pallor into her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) never
noticed, and which afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) never forgot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
own ill-health to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thought, it was not much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are late!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes were shining; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face seemed to glow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) smiled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I've been down Clifton Grove with Clara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But won't people talk?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? They know she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'s a suffragette, and so on. And what if they do
talk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, there may be nothing wrong in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``But you
know what folks are, and if once she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) gets talked about--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can't help it. Their jaw isn't so almighty important, after
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you ought to consider HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I DO! What can people say?--that we take a walk together. I believe
you're jealous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I should be GLAD if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) weren't a married woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lives separate from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) husband, and talks on
platforms; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'s already singled out from the sheep, and, as far as
I can see, hasn't much to lose. No; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) life's nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), so what's
the worth of nothing? She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) goes with me--it becomes something. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
must pay--we both must pay! Folk are so frightened of paying; they'd
rather starve and die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my son. We'll see how it will end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my mother. I'll abide by the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s AWFULLY nice, mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is really! You don't know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not the same as marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's perhaps better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence for a while. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother something,
but was afraid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you like to know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel coolly. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s nice, mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is! And not a bit common!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never suggested she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you seem to think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s--not as good as--She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s better than
ninety-nine folk out of a hundred, I tell you! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s BETTER, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is!
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s fair, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s honest, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s straight! There isn't anything underhand
or superior about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Don't be mean about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morel flushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I am not mean about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may be quite as you say, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't approve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you expect me to?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) answered coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!--yes!--if you'd anything about you, you'd be glad! Do you WANT to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--shall I bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You please yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I WILL bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) here--one Sunday--to tea. If you think a horrid
thing about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), I shan't forgive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As if it would make any difference!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had won.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but it feels so fine, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s there! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s such a queen in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) still walked a little way from chapel with Miriam and
Edgar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) did not go up to the farm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), however, was very much the
same with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) did not feel embarrassed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) presence. One
evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was alone when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). They began by talking
books: it was their unfailing topic. Mrs. Morel had said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) and
Miriam's affair was like a fire fed on books--if there were no more
volumes it would die out. Miriam, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) part, boasted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could
read him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) like a book, could place her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) finger any minute on the chapter
and the line. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), easily taken in, believed that Miriam knew more about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) than anyone else. So it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) about himself,
like the simplest egoist. Very soon the conversation drifted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) own
doings. It flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) immensely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was of such supreme interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have you been doing lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--oh, not much! I made a sketch of Bestwood from the garden, that is
nearly right at last. It's the hundredth try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they went on. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not been out, then, lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I went up Clifton Grove on Monday afternoon with Clara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not very nice weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam, <div class="bookquote">``was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wanted to go out, and it was all right. The Trent IS full.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you go to Barton?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; we had tea in Clifton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``DID you! That would be nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was! The jolliest old woman! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave us several pompom dahlias, as
pretty as you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head and brooded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was quite unconscious of
concealing anything from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) give them you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked us--because we were jolly, I should think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam put her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) finger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you late home?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) resented her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I caught the seven-thirty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on in silence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how IS Clara?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>asked Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite all right, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, with a tinge of irony. <div class="bookquote">``By the way, what of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
husband? One never hears anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s got some other woman, and is also quite all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) replied.
<div class="bookquote">``At least, so I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see--you don't know for certain. Don't you think a position like that
is hard on a woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rottenly hard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so unjust!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam. <div class="bookquote">``The man does as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let the woman also,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? And if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does, look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's impossible! You don't understand what a woman forfeits--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. But if a woman's got nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fair fame to feed on,
why, it's thin tack, and a donkey would die of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) moral attitude, at least, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would
act accordingly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) never asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) anything direct, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) got to know enough.

<p/>Another day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) saw Miriam, the conversation turned to marriage,
then to Clara's marriage with Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never knew the fearful importance of marriage.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought it was all in the day's march--it would have to come--and
Dawes--well, a good many women would have given their souls to get
him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>); so why not him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) developed into the femme incomprise, and
treated him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) badly, I'll bet my boots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) didn't understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had to. It isn't altogether a question
of understanding; it's a question of living. With him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was only
half-alive; the rest was dormant, deadened. And the dormant woman was
the femme incomprise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) HAD to be awakened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I rather think he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) can, but he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s a
fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was something like your mother and father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but my mother, I believe, got real joy and satisfaction out of
my father at first. I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a passion for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); that's why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). After all, they were bound to each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what one MUST HAVE, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) continued--<div class="bookquote">``the real, real
flame of feeling through another person--once, only once, if it only
lasts three months. See, my mother looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d HAD everything that
was necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) living and developing. There's not a tiny bit of
feeling of sterility about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And with my father, at first, I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had the real thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
knows; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been there. You can feel it about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and
about hundreds of people you meet every day; and, once it has happened
to you, you can go on with anything and ripen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What happened, exactly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>asked Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so hard to say, but the something big and intense that changes
you when you really come together with somebody else. It almost seems to
fertilise your soul and make it that you can go on and mature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think your mother had it with your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and at the bottom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feels grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for giving it her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
even now, though they are miles apart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think Clara never had it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam pondered this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was seeking--a sort of baptism of
fire in passion, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) realised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would never be
satisfied till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had it. Perhaps it was essential to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), as to some
men, to sow wild oats; and afterwards, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was satisfied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would
not rage with restlessness any more, but could settle down and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) life into her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands. Well, then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) must go, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) go and have
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) fill--something big and intense, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) called it. At any rate, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
had got it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would not want it--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would want
the other thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would want to be owned, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) could work. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) a bitter thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) must go, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) go into an inn for a glass of whisky, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) go to Clara, so long as it was something that would satisfy a need
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) free for herself to possess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you told your mother about Clara?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew this would be a test of the seriousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) feeling for the
other woman: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was going to Clara for something vital, not as
a man goes for pleasure to a prostitute, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is coming to tea on Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To your house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I want mater to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence. Things had gone quicker than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt
a sudden bitterness that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so soon and so entirely.
And was Clara to be accepted by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) people, who had been so hostile to
herself?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may call in as I go to chapel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is a long time since I
saw Clara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, astonished, and unconsciously angry.

<p/>On the Sunday afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to Keston to meet Clara at the station.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood on the platform he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trying to examine in himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had a premonition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I FEEL as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'d come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to find
out. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart felt queer and contracted. That seemed like foreboding.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) HAD a foreboding she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would not come! Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would not come,
and instead of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) over the fields home, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had imagined,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have to go alone. The train was late; the afternoon would
be wasted, and the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) for not coming. Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
promised, then, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) promise? Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had
missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) train--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself was always missing trains--but that was no
reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) should miss this particular one. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>);
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was furious.

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the train crawling, sneaking round the corner. Here,
then, was the train, but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had not come. The green engine
hissed along the platform, the row of brown carriages drew up, several
doors opened. No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had not come! No! Yes; ah, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was! She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had
a big black hat on! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) side in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you weren't coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was laughing rather breathlessly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
their eyes met. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) quickly along the platform, talking at a
great rate to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked beautiful. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hat were
large silk roses, coloured like tarnished gold. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) costume of dark
cloth fitted so beautifully over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast and shoulders. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pride
went up as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt the station people, who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
eyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with awe and admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sure you weren't coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed shakily.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) laughed in answer, almost with a little cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I wondered, when I was in the train, WHATEVER I should do if you
weren't there!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand impulsively, and they went along the narrow twitchel.
They took the road into Nuttall and over the Reckoning House Farm. It
was a blue, mild day. Everywhere the brown leaves lay scattered; many
scarlet hips stood upon the hedge beside the wood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) gathered a few for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to wear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) fitted them into the breast of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
coat, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to object to my getting them, because of the birds.
But they don't care much for rose-hips in this part, where they can
get plenty of stuff. You often find the berries going rotten in the
springtime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) chattered, scarcely aware of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) said, only knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) was
putting berries in the bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) coat, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood patiently for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) quick hands, so full of life, and it seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had never SEEN anything before. Till now, everything had been
indistinct.

<p/>They came near to the colliery. It stood quite still and black among the
corn-fields, its immense heap of slag seen rising almost from the oats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity there is a coal-pit here where it is so pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said
Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``You see, I am so used to it I should
miss it. No; and I like the pits here and there. I like the rows of
trucks, and the headstocks, and the steam in the daytime, and the lights
at night. When I was a boy, I always thought a pillar of cloud by day
and a pillar of fire by night was a pit, with its steam, and its
lights, and the burning bank,--and I thought the Lord was always at the
pit-top.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As they drew near home she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked in silence, and seemed to hang back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) flushed, but gave no response.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to come home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I want to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/>It did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) position in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) home would be rather a
peculiar and difficult one. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) it seemed just as if one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) men
friends were going to be introduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nuttall</b></font>) mother, only nicer.

<p/>The Morels lived in a house in an ugly street that ran down a steep
hill. The street itself was hideous. The house was rather superior
to most. It was old, grimy, with a big bay window, and it was
semi-detached; but it looked gloomy. Then Paul opened the door to the
garden, and all was different. The sunny afternoon was there, like
another land. By the path grew tansy and little trees. In front of the
window was a plot of sunny grass, with old lilacs round it. And away
went the garden, with heaps of dishevelled chrysanthemums in the
sunshine, down to the sycamore-tree, and the field, and beyond one
looked over a few red-roofed cottages to the hills with all the glow of
the autumn afternoon.

<p/>Mrs. Morel sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rocking-chair, wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) black silk blouse.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) grey-brown hair was taken smooth back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) brow and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) high
temples; her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face was rather pale. Clara, suffering, followed Paul into
the kitchen. Mrs. Morel rose. Clara thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) a lady, even rather
stiff. The young woman was very nervous. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had almost a wistful look,
almost resigned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother--Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Mrs. Morel held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand and smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has told me a good deal about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>The blood flamed in Clara's cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you don't mind my coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was pleased when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would bring you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Morel.

<p/>Paul, watching, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart contract with pain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked so
small, and sallow, and done-for beside the luxuriant Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's such a pretty day, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And we saw a jay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought what a
man he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dark, well-made clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was pale and
detached-looking; it would be hard for any woman to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart
glowed; then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sorry for Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you'll leave your things in the parlour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel
nicely to the young woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) led the way into the little front room,
with its old piano, its mahogany furniture, its yellowing marble
mantelpiece. A fire was burning; the place was littered with books and
drawing-boards. <div class="bookquote">``I leave my things lying about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's so much
easier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) artist's paraphernalia, and the books, and the photos of
people. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>): this was William, this was William's
young lady in the evening dress, this was Annie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) husband, this
was Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife and the baby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) were being
taken into the family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) photos, books, sketches, and they
talked a little while. Then they returned to the kitchen. Mrs. Morel put
aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) book. Clara wore a blouse of fine silk chiffon, with narrow
black-and-white stripes; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hair was done simply, coiled on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked rather stately and reserved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have gone to live down Sneinton Boulevard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel. <div class="bookquote">``When
I was a girl--girl, I say!--when I was a young woman WE lived in Minerva
Terrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, did you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara. <div class="bookquote">``I have a friend in number 6.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the conversation had started. They talked Nottingham and Nottingham
people; it interested them both. Clara was still rather nervous; Mrs.
Morel was still somewhat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dignity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) clipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) language very
clear and precise. But they were going to get on well together, Paul
saw.

<p/>Mrs. Morel measured herself against the younger woman, and found herself
easily stronger. Clara was deferential. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew Paul's surprising
regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had dreaded the meeting, expecting
someone rather hard and cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was surprised to find this little
interested woman chatting with such readiness; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
felt with Paul, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would not care to stand in Mrs. Morel's way.
There was something so hard and certain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never
had a misgiving in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life.

<p/>Presently Morel came down, ruffled and yawning, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) afternoon
sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) grizzled head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) plodded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stocking feet,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waistcoat hung open over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed incongruous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Mrs. Dawes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Then Morel pulled himself together. Clara saw Paul's manner of bowing
and shaking hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to see you--I am, I
assure you. But don't disturb yourself. No, no make yourself quite
comfortable, and be very welcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara was astonished at this flood of hospitality from the old collier.
He (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) was so courteous, so gallant! She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) most delightful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And may you have come far?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only from Nottingham,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Nottingham! Then you have had a beautiful day for your journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) strayed into the scullery to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) hands and face, and from
force of habit came on to the hearth with the towel to dry himself.

<p/>At tea Clara felt the refinement and sang-froid of the household. Mrs.
Morel was perfectly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) ease. The pouring out the tea and attending
to the people went on unconsciously, without interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
talk. There was a lot of room at the oval table; the china of dark blue
willow-pattern looked pretty on the glossy cloth. There was a little
bowl of small, yellow chrysanthemums. Clara felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) completed the
circle, and it was a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was rather afraid of the
self-possession of the Morels, father and all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) took their tone;
there was a feeling of balance. It was a cool, clear atmosphere, where
everyone was himself, and in harmony. Clara enjoyed it, but there was a
fear deep at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/>Paul cleared the table whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother and Clara talked. Clara was
conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) quick, vigorous body as it came and went, seeming blown
quickly by a wind at its work. It was almost like the hither and thither
of a leaf that comes unexpected. Most of herself went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). By the
way she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) leaned forward, as if listening, Mrs. Morel could see she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
possessed elsewhere as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) talked, and again the elder woman was sorry
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>Having finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) strolled down the garden, leaving the two women
to talk. It was a hazy, sunny afternoon, mild and soft. Clara glanced
through the window after him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loitered among the chrysanthemums.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt as if something almost tangible fastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
seemed so easy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) graceful, indolent movement, so detached as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
tied up the too-heavy flower branches to their stakes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted
to shriek in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) helplessness.

<p/>Mrs. Morel rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will let me help you wash up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, there are so few, it will only take a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/>Clara, however, dried the tea-things, and was glad to be on such good
terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother; but it was torture not to be able to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
down the garden. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) allowed herself to go; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt as if a
rope were taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ankle.

<p/>The afternoon was golden over the hills of Derbyshire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood across
in the other garden, beside a bush of pale Michaelmas daisies, watching
the last bees crawl into the hive. Hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
with an easy motion, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the end of the run with these chaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara stood near him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Over the low red wall in front was the country and
the far-off hills, all golden dim.

<p/>At that moment Miriam was entering through the garden-door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw
Clara go up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turn, and saw them come to rest together.
Something in their perfect isolation together made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) know that it was
accomplished between them, that they were, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put it, married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
walked very slowly down the cinder-track of the long garden.

<p/>Clara had pulled a button from a hollyhock spire, and was breaking it
to get the seeds. Above her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bowed head the pink flowers stared, as if
defending her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). The last bees were falling down to the hive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Count your money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>laughed Paul, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) broke the flat seeds one by one
from the roll of coin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm well off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much? Pf!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``Can I turn them into gold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>They looked into each other's eyes, laughing. At that moment they became
aware of Miriam. There was a click, and everything had altered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Miriam!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``You said you'd come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Had you forgotten?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shook hands with Clara, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems strange to see you here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other; <div class="bookquote">``it seems strange to be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is pretty, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like it very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Clara.

<p/>Then Miriam realised that Clara was accepted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had never been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you come down alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I went to Agatha's to tea. We are going to chapel. I only called
in for a moment to see Clara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have come in here to tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Miriam laughed shortly, and Clara turned impatiently aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like the chrysanthemums?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; they are very fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>replied Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which sort do you like best?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. The bronze, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you've seen all the sorts. Come and look. Come and see
which are YOUR favourites, Clara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) led the two women back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own garden, where the towsled bushes of
flowers of all colours stood raggedly along the path down to the field.
The situation did not embarrass him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knowledge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Miriam; these are the white ones that came from your garden. They
aren't so fine here, are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But they're hardier. You're so sheltered; things grow big and tender,
and then die. These little yellow ones I like. Will you have some?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>While they were out there the bells began to ring in the church,
sounding loud across the town and the field. Miriam looked at the tower,
proud among the clustering roofs, and remembered the sketches he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It had been different then, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had not left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) even
yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for a book to read. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ran indoors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! is that Miriam?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)'d call and see Clara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You told her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the sarcastic answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; why shouldn't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's certainly no reason why you shouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) winced from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's irony, frowned
irritably, thinking: <div class="bookquote">``Why can't I do as I like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not seen Mrs. Morel before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>Miriam was saying to Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s so nice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>said Miriam, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``in some ways she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s very fine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had Paul told you much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had talked a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence until he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) returned with the book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When will you want it back?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>Miriam asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Clara turned to go indoors, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) accompanied Miriam to the gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When will you come up to Willey Farm?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the latter asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother asked me to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'d be pleased to see you any time, if you
cared to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; I should like to, but I can't say when.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miriam rather bitterly, turning away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went down the path with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) mouth to the flowers he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're sure you won't come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are going to chapel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I shall see you, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div>Miriam was very bitter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They parted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt guilty towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was bitter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) scorned
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) still belonged to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) believed; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could have
Clara, take her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) home, sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) next his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother in chapel, give her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
the same hymn-book he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had given herself years before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
running quickly indoors.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not go straight in. Halting on the plot of grass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's voice, then Clara's answer:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I hate is the bloodhound quality in Miriam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother T</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother quickly, ``yes; DOESN<div class="bookquote">``T it make you hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>),
now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother T</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart went hot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was angry with them for talking about the
girl. What right had they to say that? Something in the speech itself
stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) into a flame of hate against Miriam. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own heart
rebelled furiously at Clara's taking the liberty of speaking so about
Miriam. After all, the girl was the better woman of the two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought,
if it came to goodness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went indoors. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother looked excited. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was beating with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand rhythmically on the sofa-arm, as women do who
are wearing out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could never bear to see the movement. There was a
silence; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began to talk.

<p/>In chapel Miriam saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) find the place in the hymn-book for Clara, in
exactly the same way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) used for herself. And during the sermon he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
could see the girl across the chapel, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hat throwing a dark shadow
over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. What did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) think, seeing Clara with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not
stop to consider. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt himself cruel towards Miriam.

<p/>After chapel he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went over Pentrich with Clara. It was a dark autumn
night. They had said good-bye to Miriam, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart had smitten him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left the girl alone. <div class="bookquote">``But it serves her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said inside
himself, and it almost gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pleasure to go off under her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes with
this other handsome woman.

<p/>There was a scent of damp leaves in the darkness. Clara's hand lay warm
and inert in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own as they walked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was full of conflict. The battle
that raged inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feel desperate.

<p/>Up Pentrich Hill Clara leaned against him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) slid his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arm
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) waist. Feeling the strong motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) body under his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arm as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked, the tightness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chest because of Miriam relaxed, and
the hot blood bathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) closer and closer.

<p/>Then: <div class="bookquote">``You still keep on with Miriam,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only talk. There never WAS a great deal more than talk between us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
said bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother doesn't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, or I might have married her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). But it's all up really!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) voice went passionate with hate.

<p/>``If I was with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) now, we should be jawing about the <div class="bookquote">``Christian
Mystery', or some such tack. Thank God, I'm not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on in silence for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can't really give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up, because there's nothing to give,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and I shouldn't be friends as long as we live,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``But it'll only be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara drew away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), leaning away from contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you drawing away for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did not answer, but drew farther from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you want to walk alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Still there was no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked resentfully, hanging her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I said I would be friends with Miriam!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you it's only words that go between us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) persisted, trying to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) again.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) resisted. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) strode across in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), barring her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better run after Miriam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>mocked Clara.

<p/>The blood flamed up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) teeth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) drooped
sulkily. The lane was dark, quite lonely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) suddenly caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arms, stretched forward, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face in a kiss of
rage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned frantically to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fast. Hard and
relentless his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth came for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breasts hurt against the wall of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chest. Helpless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) went loose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard people coming down the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand up! stand up!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said thickly, gripping her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm till it hurt. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had let go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would have sunk to the ground.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sighed and walked dizzily beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). They went on in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go over the fields,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) woke up.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) let herself be helped over the stile, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked in silence
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) over the first dark field. It was the way to Nottingham and to
the station, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed to be looking about. They came out on
a bare hilltop where stood the dark figure of the ruined windmill. There
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) halted. They stood together high up in the darkness, looking at
the lights scattered on the night before them, handfuls of glittering
points, villages lying high and low on the dark, here and there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like treading among the stars,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, with a quaky laugh.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arms, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) moved aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
mouth to ask, dogged and low:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pleaded thickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes it does--yes! I must go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's early yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) insisted.

<p/>All round lay the black night, speckled and spangled with lights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chest, feeling for his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) felt the joints
fuse into fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) groped in his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) waistcoat pocket, while he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) stood
panting. In the darkness she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could see the round, pale face of the
watch, but not the figures. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stooped over it. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) was panting till he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>)
could take her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) arms again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't bother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I'm going!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, turning away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait! I'll look!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) could not see. <div class="bookquote">``I'll strike a match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) secretly hoped it was too late to catch the train. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) saw the
glowing lantern of his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) hands as he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) cradled the light: then his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) face lit
up, his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) eyes fixed on the watch. Instantly all was dark again. All was
black before her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes; only a glowing match was red near her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) feet. Where
was he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked, afraid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) voice answered out of the darkness.

<p/>There was a pause. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) power. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had heard the ring in his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
voice. It frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked, quiet, definite, hopeless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two minutes to nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) replied, telling the truth with a struggle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And can I get from here to the station in fourteen minutes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. At any rate--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could distinguish his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) dark form again a yard or so away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted
to escape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But can't I do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) said brusquely. <div class="bookquote">``But you could easily walk it, Clara;
it's only seven miles to the tram. I'll come with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I want to catch the train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do--I want to catch the train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) voice altered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) said, dry and hard. <div class="bookquote">``Come along, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) plunged ahead into the darkness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>), wanting to
cry. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) was hard and cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ran over the rough, dark
fields behind him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>), out of breath, ready to drop. But the double row of
lights at the station drew nearer. Suddenly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) cried, breaking into a run.

<p/>There was a faint rattling noise. Away to the right the train, like
a luminous caterpillar, was threading across the night. The rattling
ceased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'s over the viaduct. You'll just do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara ran, quite out of breath, and fell at last into the train. The
whistle blew. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) was gone. Gone!--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was in a carriage full of
people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt the cruelty of it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) turned round and plunged home. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) was
in the kitchen at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) was very pale. His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) eyes were dark and
dangerous-looking, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) were drunk. His (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must say your boots are in a nice state!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) feet. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) overcoat. His (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) mother
wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) were drunk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) caught the train then?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope HER feet weren't so filthy. Where on earth you dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) I
don't know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) was silent and motionless for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) asked grudgingly at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). But you'll tire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), my son; you know you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) did not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) noticed how he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) laboured in his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) breathing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been running?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had to run for the train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll go and knock yourself up. You'd better drink hot milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as good a stimulant as he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) could have, but he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) refused and went to
bed. There he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) lay face down on the counterpane, and shed tears of rage
and pain. There was a physical pain that made him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) bite his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) lips till
they bled, and the chaos inside him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) unable to think, almost to
feel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is how she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) serves me, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) heart, over and over,
pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) face in the quilt. And he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Again he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) went over the
scene, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>The next day there was a new aloofness about him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>). Clara was very gentle,
almost loving. But he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) distantly, with a touch of contempt.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sighed, continuing to be gentle. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) came round.

<p/>One evening of that week Sarah Bernhardt was at the Theatre Royal in
Nottingham, giving <div class="bookquote">``La Dame aux Camelias'' (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Bernhardt</b></font>)</div>. Paul wanted to see this old
and famous actress, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked Clara to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mother to leave the key in the window for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I book seats?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked of Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And put on an evening suit, will you? I've never seen you in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, good Lord, Clara! Think of ME in evening suit at the theatre!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
remonstrated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you rather not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will if you WANT me to; but I s'll feel a fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then feel a fool for my sake, once, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The request made his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood flush up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I s'll have to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you taking a suitcase for?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blushed furiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clara asked me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what seats are you going in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Circle--three-and-six each!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother sarcastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only once in the bluest of blue moons,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dressed at Jordan's, put on an overcoat and a cap, and met Clara in a
cafe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) suffragette friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wore an old long
coat, which did not suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and had a little wrap over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated. The three went to the theatre together.

<p/>Clara took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) coat on the stairs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) discovered she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was in a
sort of semi-evening dress, that left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms and neck and part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
breast bare. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hair was done fashionably. The dress, a simple thing
of green crape, suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked quite grand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) figure inside the frock, as if that were wrapped closely round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). The firmness and the softness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) upright body could almost be
felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fists.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was to sit all the evening beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) beautiful naked arm,
watching the strong throat rise from the strong chest, watching the
breasts under the green stuff, the curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) limbs in the tight
dress. Something in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) again for submitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to this
torture of nearness. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) balanced her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head and
stared straight in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), pouting, wistful, immobile, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
yielded herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fate because it was too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could
not help herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was in the grip of something bigger than herself.
A kind of eternal look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) were a wistful sphinx, made
it necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) programme, and crouched
down on the floor to get it, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand and wrist.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) beauty was a torture to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sat immobile. Only, when the lights
went down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sank a little against him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) caressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand and
arm with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could smell her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) faint perfume. All the time
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood kept sweeping up in great white-hot waves that killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
consciousness momentarily.

<p/>The drama continued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw it all in the distance, going on somewhere;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not know where, but it seemed far away inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was Clara's
white heavy arms, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) throat, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) moving bosom. That seemed to be
himself. Then away somewhere the play went on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was identified
with that also. There was no himself. The grey and black eyes of Clara,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bosom coming down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held gripped between his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
hands, were all that existed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt himself small and helpless,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) towering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) force above him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>Only the intervals, when the lights came up, hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) expressibly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
wanted to run anywhere, so long as it would be dark again. In a maze,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wandered out for a drink. Then the lights were out, and the strange,
insane reality of Clara and the drama took hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) again.

<p/>The play went on. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was obsessed by the desire to kiss the tiny
blue vein that nestled in the bend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could feel it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
whole face seemed suspended till he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips there. It must be
done. And the other people! At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bent quickly forward and touched
it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) moustache brushed the sensitive flesh. Clara
shivered, drew away her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm.

<p/>When all was over, the lights up, the people clapping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came to
himself and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) train was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll have to walk home!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Clara looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too late?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nodded. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love you! You look beautiful in that dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) murmured over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
shoulder, among the throng of bustling people.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) remained quiet. Together they went out of the theatre. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw the
cabs waiting, the people passing. It seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) met a pair of brown
eyes which hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and Clara turned away,
mechanically taking the direction to the station.

<p/>The train had gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have to walk the ten miles home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I shall enjoy it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, flushing, <div class="bookquote">``come home for the night? I can sleep
with mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Their eyes met.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will your mother say?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) won't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SHALL I come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And they turned away. At the first stopping-place they took the car. The
wind blew fresh in their faces. The town was dark; the tram tipped in
its haste. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand fast in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will your mother be gone to bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may be. I hope not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>They hurried along the silent, dark little street, the only people out
of doors. Clara quickly entered the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) leaped up the step and was in the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother appeared in the
inner doorway, large and hostile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who have you got there?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Mr. Morel; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) has missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) train. I thought we might put him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) up
for the night, and save him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) a ten-mile walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Radford. <div class="bookquote">``That's your lookout! If you've invited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s very welcome as far as I'm concerned. YOU keep the house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't like me, I'll go away again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, you needn't! Come along in! I dunno what you'll think of the
supper I'd got her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a little dish of chip potatoes and a piece of bacon. The table
was roughly laid for one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can have some more bacon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Radford. <div class="bookquote">``More chips you
can't have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a shame to bother you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't you be apologetic! It doesn't DO wi' me! You treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to
the theatre, didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a sarcasm in the last question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>laughed Paul uncomfortably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what's an inch of bacon! Take your coat off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The big, straight-standing woman was trying to estimate the situation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moved about the cupboard. Clara took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) coat. The room was very
warm and cosy in the lamplight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sirs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Radford; <div class="bookquote">``but you two's a pair of bright
beauties, I must say! What's all that get-up for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe we don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, feeling a victim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't room in THIS house for two such bobby-dazzlers, if you fly
your kites THAT high!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) rallied them. It was a nasty thrust.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dinner jacket, and Clara in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) green dress and bare arms,
were confused. They felt they must shelter each other in that little
kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And look at THAT blossom!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Radford, pointing to Clara.
<div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) reckon she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did it for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul looked at Clara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was rosy; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) neck was warm with blushes.
There was a moment of silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like to see it, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>The mother had them in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) power. All the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart was beating
hard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was tight with anxiety. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would fight her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me like to see it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old woman. <div class="bookquote">``What should I like to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) make a fool of herself for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen people look bigger fools,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. Clara was under his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
protection now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ay! and when was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the sarcastic rejoinder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When they made frights of themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Mrs. Radford, large and threatening, stood suspended on the hearthrug,
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) fork.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're fools either road,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) answered at length, turning to the
Dutch oven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, fighting stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``Folk ought to look as well as they
can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you call THAT looking nice!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>cried the mother, pointing a
scornful fork at Clara. <div class="bookquote">``That--that looks as if it wasn't properly
dressed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you're jealous that you can't swank as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said
laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! I could have worn evening dress with anybody, if I'd wanted to!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the scornful answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why didn't you want to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked pertinently. <div class="bookquote">``Or DID you wear
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a long pause. Mrs. Radford readjusted the bacon in the Dutch
oven. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart beat fast, for fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) exclaimed at last. <div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't! And when I was in service,
I knew as soon as one of the maids came out in bare shoulders what sort
SHE was, going to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sixpenny hop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you too good to go to a sixpenny hop?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Clara sat with bowed head. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes were dark and glittering. Mrs.
Radford took the Dutch oven from the fire, and stood near him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), putting
bits of bacon on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) plate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THERE'S a nice crozzly bit!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't give me the best!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``SHE'S got what SHE wants,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.

<p/>There was a sort of scornful forbearance in the woman's tone that made
Paul know she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was mollified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But DO have some!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to Clara.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No thanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered carelessly.

<p/>The blood was beating up like fire in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) veins. Mrs. Radford sat down
again, large and impressive and aloof. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left Clara altogether to
attend to the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say Sarah Bernhardt's fifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty! She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s turned sixty!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the scornful answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you'd never think it! She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made me want to howl even
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see myself howling at THAT bad old baggage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Radford. <div class="bookquote">``It's time she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began to think herself a grandmother, not a
shrieking catamaran--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A catamaran is a boat the Malays use,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it's a word as I use,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) retorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother does sometimes, and it's no good my telling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'd think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boxes your ears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Radford, good-humouredly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d like to, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will, so I give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a little stool to
stand on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the worst of my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never wants a stool
for anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) often can't touch THAT lady with a long prop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>retorted Mrs.
Radford to Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'd think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't want touching with a prop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I
shouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might do the pair of you good to give you a crack on the head with
one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, laughing suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you so vindictive towards me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I've not stolen
anything from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I'll watch that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>laughed the older woman.

<p/>Soon the supper was finished. Mrs. Radford sat guard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) chair. Paul
lit a cigarette. Clara went upstairs, returning with a sleeping-suit,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) spread on the fender to air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I'd forgot all about THEM!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Radford. <div class="bookquote">``Where have they
sprung from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of my drawer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm! You bought 'em for Baxter, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) wouldn't wear 'em, would
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Said he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) reckoned to do wi'out trousers i' bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>)
turned confidentially to Paul, saying: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) couldn't BEAR 'em, them
pyjama things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man sat making rings of smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's everyone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>Then followed a little discussion of the merits of pyjamas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother loves me in them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says I'm a pierrot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can imagine they'd suit you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Radford.

<p/>After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glanced at the little clock that was ticking on the
mantelpiece. It was half-past twelve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but it takes hours to settle down to sleep
after the theatre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's about time you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Radford, clearing the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are YOU tired?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked of Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) answered, avoiding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we have a game at cribbage?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll teach you again. May we play crib, Mrs. Radford?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll please yourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but it's pretty late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A game or so will make us sleepy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Clara brought the cards, and sat spinning her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wedding-ring whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shuffled them. Mrs. Radford was washing up in the scullery. As it grew
later Paul felt the situation getting more and more tense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifteen two, fifteen four, fifteen six, and two's eight--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The clock struck one. Still the game continued. Mrs. Radford had done
all the little jobs preparatory to going to bed, had locked the door
and filled the kettle. Still Paul went on dealing and counting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
obsessed by Clara's arms and throat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could see where the
division was just beginning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breasts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands, and felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) joints melt as they moved quickly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
was so near; it was almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and yet not quite. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mettle was roused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated Mrs. Radford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) sat on, nearly dropping
asleep, but determined and obstinate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) chair. Paul glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>),
then at Clara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes, that were angry, mocking, and hard as
steel. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) own answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in shame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew SHE, at any rate, was of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) played on.

<p/>At last Mrs. Radford roused herself stiffly, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it nigh on time you two was thinking o' bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul played on without answering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) sufficiently to murder
her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>The elder woman rose and sailed stubbornly into the scullery, returning
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) candle, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) put on the mantelpiece. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) sat down
again. The hatred of her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) went so hot down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) veins, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll stop, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) voice was still a challenge.

<p/>Clara saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth shut hard. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). It seemed like
an agreement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bent over the cards, coughing, to clear her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm glad you've finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Radford. <div class="bookquote">``Here, take your
things'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) thrust the warm suit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand--<div class="bookquote">``and this is your candle.
Your room's over this; there's only two, so you can't go far wrong.
Well, good-night. I hope you'll rest well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I shall; I always do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and so you ought at your age,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) replied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bade good-night to Clara, and went. The twisting stairs of white,
scrubbed wood creaked and clanged at every step. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went doggedly. The
two doors faced each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) room, pushed the door to,
without fastening the latch.

<p/>It was a small room with a large bed. Some of Clara's hair-pins were
on the dressing-table--her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hair-brush. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) clothes and some skirts hung
under a cloth in a corner. There was actually a pair of stockings over
a chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) explored the room. Two books of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own were there on the
shelf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) undressed, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) suit, and sat on the bed, listening.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blew out the candle, lay down, and in two minutes was almost
asleep. Then click!--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was wide awake and writhing in torment. It
was as if, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had nearly got to sleep, something had bitten him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
suddenly and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat up and looked at the room in the
darkness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feet doubled under him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), perfectly motionless, listening.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard a cat somewhere away outside; then the heavy, poised tread of
the mother; then Clara's distinct voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you unfasten my dress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence for some time. At last the mother said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then! aren't you coming up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div>replied the daughter calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well then! If it's not late enough, stop a bit longer. Only
you needn't come waking me up when I've got to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't be long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara.

<p/>Immediately afterwards Paul heard the mother slowly mounting the stairs.
The candlelight flashed through the cracks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) dress
brushed the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart jumped. Then it was dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
heard the clatter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) latch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was very leisurely indeed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
preparations for sleep. After a long time it was quite still. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat
strung up on the bed, shivering slightly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) door was an inch open.
As Clara came upstairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would intercept her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited. All was dead
silence. The clock struck two. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard a slight scrape of the
fender downstairs. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not help himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shivering was
uncontrollable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) must go or die.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stepped off the bed, and stood a moment, shuddering. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went
straight to the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tried to step lightly. The first stair
cracked like a shot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) listened. The old woman stirred in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bed. The
staircase was dark. There was a slit of light under the stair-foot
door, which opened into the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went on,
mechanically. Every step creaked, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) back was creeping, lest the
old woman's door should open behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) up above. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fumbled with the
door at the bottom. The latch opened with a loud clack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went through
into the kitchen, and shut the door noisily behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The old woman
daren't come now.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood, arrested. Clara was kneeling on a pile of white
underclothing on the hearthrug, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) back towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), warming herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did not look round, but sat crouching on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) heels, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) rounded
beautiful back was towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face was hidden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was warming
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) body at the fire for consolation. The glow was rosy on one side, the
shadow was dark and warm on the other. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms hung slack.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shuddered violently, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) teeth and fists hard to keep
control. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put one hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shoulder,
the fingers of the other hand under her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) chin to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face. A
convulsed shiver ran through her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), once, twice, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) touch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head bent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) murmured, realising that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands were very cold.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), frightened, like a thing that is afraid of
death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My hands are so cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) whispered, closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>The breath of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) words were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knees.
The cord of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sleeping-suit dangled against her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shiver.
As the warmth went into him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shuddering became less.

<p/>At length, unable to stand so any more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) buried
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulder. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands went over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) slowly with an
infinite tenderness of caress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) clung close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), trying to hide
herself against him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) very fast. Then at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), mute, imploring, looking to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) must be ashamed.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes were dark, very deep, and very quiet. It was as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) beauty
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) taking it hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sorrowful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with a
little pain, and was afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was so humble before her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
fervently on the eyes, first one, then the other, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) folded herself
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) gave herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fast. It was a moment intense
almost to agony.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) and tremble with joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). It healed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hurt pride. It healed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) glad. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) feel erect
and proud again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) pride had been wounded inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had been
cheapened. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) radiated with joy and pride again. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
restoration and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) recognition.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face radiant. They laughed to each other,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chest. The seconds ticked off, the minutes
passed, and still the two stood clasped rigid together, mouth to mouth,
like a statue in one block.

<p/>But again his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers went seeking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), restless, wandering,
dissatisfied. The hot blood came up wave upon wave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come you to my room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mouth pouting disconsolately,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes heavy with passion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fixedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) still heavily, sorrowfully, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
head. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes hardened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave way.

<p/>When, later on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was back in bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wondered why she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had refused to
come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) openly, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother would know. At any rate, then
things would have been definite. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could have stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) the
night, without having to go, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother's bed. It was
strange, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not understand it. And then almost immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
fell asleep.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) awoke in the morning with someone speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw Mrs. Radford, big and stately, looking down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) held a
cup of tea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think you're going to sleep till Doomsday?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought only to be about five o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``it's half-past seven, whether or not. Here, I've
brought you a cup of tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face, pushed the tumbled hair off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) forehead, and roused
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's it so late for!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) grumbled.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) resented being wakened. It amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) neck in the
flannel sleeping-jacket, as white and round as a girl's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
hair crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good your scratching your head,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It won't make it no

this here cup?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dash the cup!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should go to bed earlier,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), laughing with impudence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went to bed before YOU did,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my Guyney, you did!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, stirring his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tea, <div class="bookquote">``having tea brought to bed to me! My
mother'll think I'm ruined for life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Radford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d as leave think of flying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I always spoilt my lot! That's why they've turned out such bad
uns,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the elderly woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd only Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Radford's in heaven. So I suppose
there's only you left to be the bad un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not bad; I'm only soft,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went out of the bedroom.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm only a fool, I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara was very quiet at breakfast, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had a sort of air of
proprietorship over him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) infinitely. Mrs. Radford was
evidently fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began to talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) painting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the mother, <div class="bookquote">``of your whittling and worrying

put the fowls in instead of the dog, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was waxy, so I had to
knock a quid off. I was sick of it, and I didn't like the dog. I made a

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Radford</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIII

<p/>BAXTER DAWES

<p/>SOON after Paul had been to the theatre with Clara, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was drinking
in the Punch Bowl with some friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) when Dawes came in. Clara's
husband was growing stout; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyelids were getting slack over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brown
eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) healthy firmness of flesh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was very evidently
on the downward track. Having quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had gone
into cheap lodgings. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mistress had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for a man who would marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been in prison one night for fighting when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was drunk, and
there was a shady betting episode in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was concerned.

<p/>Paul and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were confirmed enemies, and yet there was between them that
peculiar feeling of intimacy, as if they were secretly near to each
other, which sometimes exists between two people, although they never
speak to one another. Paul often thought of Baxter Dawes, often wanted
to get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and be friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew that Dawes often thought
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and that the man was drawn to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by some bond or other. And
yet the two never looked at each other save in hostility.

<p/>Since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a superior employee at Jordan's, it was the thing for Paul
to offer Dawes a drink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What'll you have?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nowt wi' a bleeder like you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man.

<p/>Paul turned away with a slight disdainful movement of the shoulders,
very irritating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The aristocracy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``is really a military institution. Take
Germany, now. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s got thousands of aristocrats whose only means of
existence is the army. They're deadly poor, and life's deadly slow. So
they hope for a war. They look for war as a chance of getting on. Till
there's a war they are idle good-for-nothings. When there's a war, they
are leaders and commanders. There you are, then--they WANT war!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was not a favourite debater in the public-house, being too quick and
overbearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) irritated the older men by his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) assertive manner, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cocksureness. They listened in silence, and were not sorry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
finished.

<p/>Dawes interrupted the young man's flow of eloquence by asking, in a loud
sneer:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you learn all that at th' theatre th' other night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); their eyes met. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew Dawes had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
coming out of the theatre with Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what about th' theatre?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked one of Paul's associates, glad to
get a dig at the young fellow, and sniffing something tasty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) in a bob-tailed evening suit, on the lardy-da!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>sneered Dawes,
jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head contemptuously at Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's comin' it strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the mutual friend. <div class="bookquote">``Tart an' all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tart, begod!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on; let's have it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>cried the mutual friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, <div class="bookquote">``an' I reckon Morelly had it an' all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll be jiggered!''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the mutual friend. <div class="bookquote">``An' was it a proper
tart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tart, God blimey--yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, <div class="bookquote">``I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spent th' night--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a good deal of laughter at Paul's expense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who WAS she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)? D'you know her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>asked the mutual friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should SHAY SHO,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/>This brought another burst of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then spit it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the mutual friend.

<p/>Dawes shook his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head, and took a gulp of beer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>SHO</b></font>) hasn't let on himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>SHO</b></font>)'ll be braggin' of
it in a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the friend; <div class="bookquote">``it's no good. You might just as well
own up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Own up what? That I happened to take a friend to the theatre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well, if it was all right, tell us who she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the
friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) WAS all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/>Paul was furious. Dawes wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) golden moustache with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers,
sneering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strike me--! One o' that sort?''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the mutual friend. <div class="bookquote">``Paul, boy, I'm
surprised at you. And do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), Baxter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a bit, like!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) winked at the other men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``I'll be going!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>The mutual friend laid a detaining hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you don't get off as easy as that, my lad. We've got to
have a full account of this business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then get it from Dawes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't funk your own deeds, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the friend.

<p/>Then Dawes made a remark which caused Paul to throw half a glass of beer
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Morel!''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>cried the barmaid, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) rang the bell for the
<div class="bookquote">``chucker-out'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>Dawes spat and rushed for the young man. At that minute a brawny
fellow with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shirt-sleeves rolled up and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) trousers tight over his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
haunches intervened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chest in front of Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>cried Dawes.

<p/>Paul was leaning, white and quivering, against the brass rail of the
bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated Dawes, wished something could exterminate him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) at that
minute; and at the same time, seeing the wet hair on the man's forehead,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked pathetic. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come out, you--,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's enough, Dawes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>cried the barmaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the <div class="bookquote">``chucker-out'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>, with kindly insistence, <div class="bookquote">``you'd better
be getting on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>And, by making Dawes edge away from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own close proximity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THAT'S the little sod as started it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>cried Dawes, half-cowed, pointing
to Paul Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what a story, Mr. Dawes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>said the barmaid. <div class="bookquote">``You know it was you
all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Still the <div class="bookquote">``chucker-out''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>kept thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) chest forward at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), still
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) kept edging back, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was in the doorway and on the steps
outside; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) turned round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, nodding straight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rival.

<p/>Paul had a curious sensation of pity, almost of affection, mingled with
violent hate, for the man. The coloured door swung to; there was silence
in the bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Serve, him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>), jolly well right!''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>said the barmaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's a nasty thing to get a glass of beer in your eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the
mutual friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you I was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>said the barmaid. <div class="bookquote">``Will you have
another, Mr. Morel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) held up Paul's glass questioningly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s a man as doesn't care for anything, is Baxter Dawes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>said the barmaid. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)'s a loud-mouthed one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) is, and
they're never much good. Give me a pleasant-spoken chap, if you want a
devil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Paul, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the friend, <div class="bookquote">``you'll have to take care of
yourself now for a while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't have to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a chance over you, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>said the
barmaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you box?''  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>asked a friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) answered, still very white.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I might give you a turn or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>said the friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, I haven't time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And presently he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), Mr. Jenkinson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>whispered the barmaid, tipping Mr.
Jenkinson the wink.

<p/>The man nodded, took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, said: <div class="bookquote">``Good-night all!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>very heartily, and
followed Paul, calling:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half a minute, old man. You an' me's going the same road, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Morel doesn't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barmaid</b></font>)</div>said the barmaid. <div class="bookquote">``You'll see, we shan't
have him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) in much more. I'm sorry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'s good company. And Baxter Dawes
wants locking up, that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) wants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul would have died rather than his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother should get to know of this
affair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) suffered tortures of humiliation and self-consciousness.
There was now a good deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life of which necessarily he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not
speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a life apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sexual life. The
rest she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still kept. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to conceal something from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and it irked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). There was a certain silence between them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had, in that silence, to defend himself against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt
condemned by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Then sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and pulled at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
bondage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life wanted to free itself of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It was like a circle
where life turned back on itself, and got no farther. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love turned back into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could
not be free to go forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own life, really love another woman.
At this period, unknowingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) resisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did
not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) things; there was a distance between them.

<p/>Clara was happy, almost sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had at last got him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
for herself; and then again came the uncertainty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) jestingly
of the affair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) husband. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) colour came up, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) grey eyes
flashed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) to a `T',''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``like a navvy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)'s not fit for mixing
with decent folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you married him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) furious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``But how was I to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) might have been rather nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) made himself. But there's something about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lover closely. There was something in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hated,
a sort of detached criticism of herself, a coldness which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
woman's soul harden against him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Baxter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing to do, is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) if you have to, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I haven't the least sense of the `fist'. It's funny. With most men
there's the instinct to clench the fist and hit. It's not so with me. I
should want a knife or a pistol or something to fight with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'd better carry something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed; <div class="bookquote">``I'm not daggeroso.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)'ll do something to you. You don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, if I can't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) kills you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be sorry, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) sake and mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara was silent for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You DO make me angry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nothing afresh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why are you so silly? You don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you're not going to let a man do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What must I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should carry a revolver,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might blow my fingers off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a fool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fact!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) teeth with anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could SHAKE you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cried, trembling with passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let a man like HIM do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) triumphs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to hate you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I only tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And YOU say you LOVE me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) exclaimed, low and indignant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought I to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to please you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But if I did, see what a
hold he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d have over me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I'm a fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. But you don't understand me, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you ought NOT to expose yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`The man in righteousness arrayed,
The pure and blameless liver,
Needs not the keen Toledo blade,
Nor venom-freighted quiver,'''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quoted.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) searchingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's simply nothing to understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head, brooding.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not see Dawes for several days; then one morning as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran
upstairs from the Spiral room he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost collided with the burly
metal-worker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the--!''  (<font color='red'><b>the smith</b></font>)</div>cried the smith.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, and passed on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``SORRY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>sneered Dawes.

<p/>Paul whistled lightly, <div class="bookquote">``Put Me among the Girls'' (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stop your whistle, my jockey!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>The other took no notice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're goin' to answer for that job of the other night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) desk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) corner, and turned over the leaves of the
ledger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and tell Fanny I want order 097, quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) boy.

<p/>Dawes stood in the doorway, tall and threatening, looking at the top of
the young man's head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Six and five's eleven and seven's one-and-six,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul added aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' you hear, do you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``FIVE AND NINEPENCE!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wrote a figure. <div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to show you what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the smith</b></font>)</div>said the smith.

<p/>The other went on adding the figures aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer crawlin' little--, yer daresn't face me proper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul quickly snatched the heavy ruler. Dawes started. The young man
ruled some lines in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ledger. The elder man was infuriated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But wait till I light on you, no matter where it is, I'll settle your
hash for a bit, yer little swine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>At that the smith started heavily from the doorway. Just then a whistle
piped shrilly. Paul went to the speaking-tube.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) listened. <div class="bookquote">``Er--yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) listened, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I'll come down directly. I've got a visitor just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes knew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been speaking to Clara. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stepped
forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer little devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll visitor you, inside of two minutes!
Think I'm goin' to have YOU whipperty-snappin' round?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The clerks</b></font>)</div><p/>The other clerks in the warehouse looked up. Paul's office-boy appeared,
holding some white article.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny says you could have had it last night if you'd let her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>answered Paul, looking at the stocking. <div class="bookquote">``Get it off.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Dawes
stood frustrated, helpless with rage. Morel turned round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to Dawes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would have run
downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By God, I'll stop your gallop!''  (<font color='red'><b>the smith</b></font>)</div>shouted the smith, seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) by the
arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) turned quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey! Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the office-boy, alarmed.

<p/>Thomas Jordan started out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) little glass office, and came running
down the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a-matter, what's a-matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) old man's sharp
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just goin' ter settle this little--, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes
desperately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas Jordan/Thomas</b></font>)</div>snapped Thomas Jordan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) hung fire.

<p/>Morel was leaning against the counter, ashamed, half-grinning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's it all about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas Jordan/Thomas</b></font>)</div>snapped Thomas Jordan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head and shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't yer, couldn't yer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>cried Dawes, thrusting forward his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
handsome, furious face, and squaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you finished?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the old man, strutting. <div class="bookquote">``Get off about your
business, and don't come here tipsy in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) big frame slowly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tipsy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Who's tipsy? I'm no more tipsy than YOU are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've heard that song before,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>snapped the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Now you get off,
and don't be long about it. Comin' HERE with your rowdying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The smith</b></font>)</div><p/>The smith looked down contemptuously on his (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) employer. His (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) hands, large,
and grimy, and yet well shaped for his (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) labour, worked restlessly. Paul
remembered they were the hands of Clara's husband, and a flash of hate
went through him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out before you're turned out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas Jordan/Thomas</b></font>)</div>snapped Thomas Jordan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, who'll turn me out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, beginning to sneer.

<p/>Mr. Jordan started, marched up to the smith, waving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) off, thrusting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) stout little figure at the man, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get off my premises--get off!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) seized and twitched Dawes's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come off!''  (<font color='red'><b>the smith</b></font>)</div>said the smith, and with a jerk of the elbow he (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) sent the
little manufacturer staggering backwards.

<p/>Before anyone could help him (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>), Thomas Jordan had collided with the flimsy
spring-door. It had given way, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) crash down the half-dozen
steps into Fanny's room. There was a second of amazement; then men and
girls were running. Dawes stood a moment looking bitterly on the scene,
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) departure.

<p/>Thomas Jordan was shaken and braised, not otherwise hurt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) was,
however, beside himself with rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) dismissed Dawes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>)
employment, and summoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) for assault.

<p/>At the trial Paul Morel had to give evidence. Asked how the trouble
began, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dawes took occasion to insult Mrs. Dawes and me because I accompanied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) to the theatre one evening; then I threw some beer at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) revenge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Cherchez la femme!_''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>smiled the magistrate.

<p/>The case was dismissed after the magistrate had told Dawes he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) thought
him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) a skunk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You gave the case away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jordan</b></font>)</div>snapped Mr. Jordan to Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the latter. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, you didn't really
want a conviction, did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think I took the case up for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Clara was also
very angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why need MY name have been dragged in?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better speak it openly than leave it to be whispered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no need for anything at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are none the poorer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said indifferently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU may not be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need never have been mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not sound sorry.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told himself easily: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) will come round.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother about the fall of Mr. Jordan and the trial of Dawes.
Mrs. Morel watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you think of it all?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) said.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) was very uncomfortable, nevertheless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever considered where it will end?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) mother said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``things work out of themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do, in a way one doesn't like, as a rule,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then one has to put up with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find you're not as good at `putting up' as you imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) went on working rapidly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) design.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you ever ask HER opinion?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said at length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of you, and the whole thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care what her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) opinion of me is. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s fearfully in love with
me, but it's not very deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But quite as deep as your feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) looked up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) mother curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) said. ``You know, mother, I think there must be something the
matter with me, that I CAN<div class="bookquote">``T love. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s there, as a rule, I DO
love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Sometimes, when I see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) just as THE WOMAN, I love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
mother; but then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talks and criticises, I often don't listen to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s as much sense as Miriam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps; and I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) better than Miriam. But WHY don't they hold
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The last question was almost a lamentation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) mother turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
face, sat looking across the room, very quiet, grave, with something of
renunciation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you wouldn't want to marry Clara?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; at first perhaps I would. But why--why don't I want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) or
anybody? I feel sometimes as if I wronged my women, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How wronged them, my son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) went on painting rather despairingly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) had touched the quick of the
trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And as for wanting to marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``there's plenty of time
yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But no, mother. I even love Clara, and I did Miriam; but to GIVE myself
to them in marriage I couldn't. I couldn't belong to them. They seem to
want ME, and I can't ever give it them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't met the right woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I never shall meet the right woman while you live,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was very quiet. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to feel again tired, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were
done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered.

<p/>The feeling that things were going in a circle made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) mad.

<p/>Clara was, indeed, passionately in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), as
far as passion went. In the daytime he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) a good deal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was
working in the same building, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) was not aware of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) was busy,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) existence was of no matter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>). But all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) Spiral room she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had a sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) was upstairs, a physical sense
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) person in the same building. Every second she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) to
come through the door, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) came it was a shock to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>)
was often short and offhand with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) directions in an
official manner, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) at bay. With what wits she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had left she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) dared not misunderstand or fail to remember, but
it was a cruelty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) chest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew exactly
how his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) breast was shapen under the waistcoat, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to touch
it. It maddened her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) mechanical voice giving orders about
the work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to break through the sham of it, smash the trivial
coating of business which covered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) with hardness, get at the man
again; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was afraid, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could feel one touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
warmth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ached again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was dreary every evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) a good deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time. The days were often a misery to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>),
but the evenings and the nights were usually a bliss to them both. Then
they were silent. For hours they sat together, or walked together in the
dark, and talked only a few, almost meaningless words. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bosom left its warmth in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest, making him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feel
whole.

<p/>One evening they were walking down by the canal, and something was
troubling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had not got him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). All the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whistled
softly and persistently to himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) listened, feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could
learn more from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whistling than from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech. It was a sad
dissatisfied tune--a tune that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) feel he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked on in silence. When they came to the swing bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down
on the great pole, looking at the stars in the water. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a long way
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had been thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you always stay at Jordan's?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered without reflecting. <div class="bookquote">``No; I s'll leave Nottingham and
go abroad--soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go abroad! What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno! I feel restless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what shall you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to get some steady designing work, and some sort of sale
for my pictures first,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am gradually making my way. I know I
am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when do you think you'll go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I shall hardly go for long, while there's my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at the stars in the black water. They lay very white and
staring. It was an agony to know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), but it was almost
an agony to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you made a nice lot of money, what would you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go somewhere in a pretty house near London with my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a long pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could still come and see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Don't ask me
what I should do; I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence. The stars shuddered and broke upon the water. There
came a breath of wind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went suddenly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me anything about the future,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said miserably. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know anything. Be with me now, will you, no matter what it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was a married woman, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had no right even to what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) badly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was miserable. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) warmth she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) folded
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over, consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would let the moment stand for
itself.

<p/>After a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, struggling.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) caught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passionately to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not bear the suffering in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was
afraid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have anything of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)--anything; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did
not want to KNOW. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not bear it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be
soothed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)--soothed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood clasping him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and caressing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was something unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)--something almost uncanny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to
soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into forgetfulness.

<p/>And soon the struggle went down in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgot. But then
Clara was not there for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), only a woman, warm, something he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved
and almost worshipped, there in the dark. But it was not Clara, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
submitted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The naked hunger and inevitability of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>),
something strong and blind and ruthless in its primitiveness, made the
hour almost terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew how stark and alone he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt it was great that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply
because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) need was bigger either than her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) or him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) soul was
still within her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did this for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) need, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>),
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>All the while the peewits were screaming in the field. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered what was near his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, curving and strong with life in the
dark, and what voice it was speaking. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realised it was the grass,
and the peewit was calling. The warmth was Clara's breathing heaving.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes. They were dark and shining
and strange, life wild at the source staring into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, stranger to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), yet meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) throat, afraid.
What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)? A strong, strange, wild life, that breathed with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
in the darkness through this hour. It was all so much bigger than
themselves that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was hushed. They had met, and included in their
meeting the thrust of the manifold grass stems, the cry of the peewit,
the wheel of the stars.

<p/>When they stood up they saw other lovers stealing down the opposite
hedge. It seemed natural they were there; the night contained them.

<p/>And after such an evening they both were very still, having known
the immensity of passion. They felt small, half-afraid, childish and
wondering, like Adam and Eve when they lost their innocence and realised
the magnificence of the power which drove them out of Paradise and
across the great night and the great day of humanity. It was for each of
them an initiation and a satisfaction. To know their own nothingness,
to know the tremendous living flood which carried them always, gave them
rest within themselves. If so great a magnificent power could overwhelm
them, identify them altogether with itself, so that they knew they were
only grains in the tremendous heave that lifted every grass blade its
little height, and every tree, and living thing, then why fret about
themselves? They could let themselves be carried by life, and they felt
a sort of peace each in the other. There was a verification which they
had had together. Nothing could nullify it, nothing could take it away;
it was almost their belief in life.

<p/>But Clara was not satisfied. Something great was there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew;
something great enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). But it did not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). In the morning
it was not the same. They had KNOWN, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not keep the moment.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted it again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted something permanent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had not
realised fully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) thought it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was not safe
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). This that had been between them might never be again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) might
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had not got him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was not satisfied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had been
there, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had not gripped the--the something--she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew not
what--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was mad to have.

<p/>In the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had considerable peace, and was happy in himself. It
seemed almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had known the baptism of fire in passion, and it
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) at rest. But it was not Clara. It was something that happened
because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), but it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). They were scarcely any nearer each
other. It was as if they had been blind agents of a great force.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) that day at the factory her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) heart melted like a drop of
fire. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) body, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) brows. The drop of fire grew more intense
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) must hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), very quiet, very subdued this
morning, went on giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) instruction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) into the
dark, ugly basement, and lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and the
intensity of passion began to burn him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) again. Somebody was at the door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ran upstairs; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) room, moving as if in a trance.

<p/>After that the fire slowly went down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt more and more that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
experience had been impersonal, and not Clara. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). There was
a big tenderness, as after a strong emotion they had known together; but
it was not she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) who could keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) soul steady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to be
something she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not be.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was mad with desire of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) without
touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). In the factory, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) about Spiral hose,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ran her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand secretly along his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) out into the
basement for a quick kiss; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes, always mute and yearning, full of
unrestrained passion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) kept fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), lest
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) should too flagrantly give herself away before the other girls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
invariably waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) at dinnertime for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) were helpless, almost a burden to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and
it irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you always want to be kissing and embracing for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Surely there's a time for everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and the hate came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DO I always want to be kissing you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always, even if I come to ask you about the work. I don't want anything
to do with love when I'm at work. Work's work--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is love?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Has it to have special hours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; out of work hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll regulate it according to Mr. Jordan's closing time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and according to the freedom from business of any sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only to exist in spare time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all, and not always then--not the kissing sort of love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's all you think of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's quite enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was cold to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) for some time--she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was
cold and contemptuous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was uneasy till she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) again.
But when they started afresh they were not any nearer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) never satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/>In the spring they went together to the seaside. They had rooms at
a little cottage near Theddlethorpe, and lived as man and wife. Mrs.
Radford sometimes went with them.

<p/>It was known in Nottingham that Paul Morel and Mrs. Dawes were going
together, but as nothing was very obvious, and Clara always a solitary
person, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) seemed so simple and innocent, it did not make much
difference.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) loved the Lincolnshire coast, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) loved the sea. In the early
morning they often went out together to bathe. The grey of the dawn,
the far, desolate reaches of the fenland smitten with winter, the
sea-meadows rank with herbage, were stark enough to rejoice his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soul.
As they stepped on to the highroad from their plank bridge, and looked
round at the endless monotony of levels, the land a little darker than
the sky, the sea sounding small beyond the sandhills, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart filled
strong with the sweeping relentlessness of life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was solitary and strong, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes had a beautiful light.

<p/>They shuddered with cold; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) raced her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) down the road to the green
turf bridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could run well. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) colour soon came, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) throat was
bare, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes shone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) for being so luxuriously heavy, and
yet so quick. Himself was light; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) went with a beautiful rush. They
grew warm, and walked hand in hand.

<p/>A flush came into the sky, the wan moon, half-way down the west, sank
into insignificance. On the shadowy land things began to take life,
plants with great leaves became distinct. They came through a pass in
the big, cold sandhills on to the beach. The long waste of foreshore lay
moaning under the dawn and the sea; the ocean was a flat dark strip with
a white edge. Over the gloomy sea the sky grew red. Quickly the fire
spread among the clouds and scattered them. Crimson burned to orange,
orange to dull gold, and in a golden glitter the sun came up, dribbling
fierily over the waves in little splashes, as if someone had gone along
and the light had spilled from her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) pail as she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) walked.

<p/>The breakers ran down the shore in long, hoarse strokes. Tiny seagulls,
like specks of spray, wheeled above the line of surf. Their crying
seemed larger than they. Far away the coast reached out, and melted into
the morning, the tussocky sandhills seemed to sink to a level with the
beach. Mablethorpe was tiny on their right. They had alone the space of
all this level shore, the sea, and the upcoming sun, the faint noise of
the waters, the sharp crying of the gulls.

<p/>They had a warm hollow in the sandhills where the wind did not come. He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
stood looking out to sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't get sentimental,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said.

<p/>It irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) to see him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) standing gazing at the sea, like a solitary
and poetic person. He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) laughed. She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) quickly undressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are some fine waves this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said triumphantly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was a better swimmer than he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) stood idly watching her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was white and velvet skinned, with heavy shoulders. A little wind,
coming from the sea, blew across her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) body and ruffled her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) hair.

<p/>The morning was of a lovely limpid gold colour. Veils of shadow seemed
to be drifting away on the north and the south. Clara stood shrinking
slightly from the touch of the wind, twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hair. The sea-grass
rose behind the white stripped woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) glanced at the sea, then
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with dark eyes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) loved and
could not understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breasts between her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms, cringing,
laughing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oo, it will be so cold!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) bent forward and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), held her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) suddenly close, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes, then away at the pale
sands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) neck, drew him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
passionately, and went, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) went plodding heavily over the sand that was soft as velvet. He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>),
on the sandhills, watched the great pale coast envelop her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) grew
smaller, lost proportion, seemed only like a large white bird toiling
forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much more than a big white pebble on the beach, not much more
than a clot of foam being blown and rolled over the sand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said to
himself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) seemed to move very slowly across the vast sounding shore. As he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
watched, he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was dazzled out of sight by the sunshine.
Again he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), the merest white speck moving against the white,
muttering sea-edge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look how little she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said to himself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s lost like a grain
of sand in the beach--just a concentrated speck blown along, a tiny
white foam-bubble, almost nothing among the morning. Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) absorb
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The morning was altogether uninterrupted: she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was gone in the water. Far
and wide the beach, the sandhills with their blue marrain, the shining
water, glowed together in immense, unbroken solitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), after all?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said to himself. <div class="bookquote">``Here's the seacoast
morning, big and permanent and beautiful; there is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), fretting, always
unsatisfied, and temporary as a bubble of foam. What does she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) mean
to me, after all? She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) represents something, like a bubble of foam
represents the sea. But what is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)? It's not her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) I care for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, startled by his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) own unconscious thoughts, that seemed to speak so
distinctly that all the morning could hear, he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) undressed and ran quickly
down the sands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was watching for him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm flashed up to him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
heaved on a wave, subsided, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shoulders in a pool of liquid silver.
He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) jumped through the breakers, and in a moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand was on his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
shoulder.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) was a poor swimmer, and could not stay long in the water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) played
round him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) in triumph, sporting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) superiority, which he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) begrudged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). The sunshine stood deep and fine on the water. They laughed in the
sea for a minute or two, then raced each other back to the sandhills.

<p/>When they were drying themselves, panting heavily, he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
laughing, breathless face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bright shoulders, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breasts that swayed
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) frightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) rubbed them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) thought again:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is magnificent, and even bigger than the morning and the sea.
Is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)--? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) dark eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), broke off from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) drying with a
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you looking at?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) answered, laughing.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>), and in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) was kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) white
<div class="bookquote">``goose-fleshed''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>shoulder, and thinking:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)? What is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) in the morning. There was something detached, hard, and
elemental about his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) kisses then, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) were only conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) own
will, not in the least of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>).

<p/>Later in the day he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) went out sketching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``go with your mother to Sutton. I am so dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stood and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to come with him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
preferred to be alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) feel imprisoned when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was there,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) could not get a free deep breath, as if there were something on
top of him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) desire to be free of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/>In the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). They walked down the shore in the
darkness, then sat for a while in the shelter of the sandhills.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, as they stared over the darkness of the sea, where
no light was to be seen--<div class="bookquote">``it seemed as if you only loved me at night--as
if you didn't love me in the daytime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) ran the cold sand through his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) fingers, feeling guilty under the
accusation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The night is free to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``In the daytime I want to be by
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why, even now, when we are on this short holiday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Love-making stifles me in the daytime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it needn't be always love-making,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It always is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``when you and I are together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sat feeling very bitter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you ever want to marry me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) asked curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; I should like us to have children,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) answered slowly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head bent, fingering the sand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't really want a divorce from Baxter, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said.

<p/>It was some minutes before she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, very deliberately; <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel as if you belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) belongs to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) was silent for some minutes, listening to the wind blowing over the
hoarse, dark sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you never really intended to belong to ME?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do belong to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``because you don't want to be divorced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a knot they could not untie, so they left it, took what they
could get, and what they could not attain they ignored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider you treated Baxter rottenly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said another time.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) half-expected Clara to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>), as his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) mother would: <div class="bookquote">``You consider
your own affairs, and don't know so much about other people's.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
took him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) seriously, almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) own surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) was a lily of the valley, and so you put him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)
in an appropriate pot, and tended him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) according. You made up your mind
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) was a lily of the valley and it was no good his (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) being a cow-parsnip.
You wouldn't have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly never imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) a lily of the valley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) something he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) wasn't. That's just what a woman is. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows what's good for a man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s going to see he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets
it; and no matter if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s starving, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may sit and whistle for what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
needs, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and is giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what's good for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm thinking what tune I shall whistle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>And instead of boxing his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) ears, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) considered him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) in earnest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I want to give you what's good for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so; but love should give a sense of freedom, not of prison.
Miriam made me feel tied up like a donkey to a stake. I must feed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
patch, and nowhere else. It's sickening!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And would YOU let a WOMAN do as she (<font color='blue'><b>WOMAN</b></font>) likes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I'll see that she (<font color='blue'><b>WOMAN</b></font>) likes to love me. If she (<font color='blue'><b>WOMAN</b></font>) doesn't--well, I don't
hold her (<font color='blue'><b>WOMAN</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were as wonderful as you say--,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be the marvel I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>There was a silence in which they hated each other, though they laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Love's a dog in a manger,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And which of us is the dog?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well, you, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So there went on a battle between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) never fully had
him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>). Some part, big and vital in him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had no hold over; nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
ever try to get it, or even to realise what it was. And he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) knew in some
way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) held herself still as Mrs. Dawes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) did not love Dawes,
never had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>), at least depended on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) felt a certain surety about him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) never felt with Paul
Morel. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) passion for the young man had filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) soul, given her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
a certain satisfaction, eased her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) self-mistrust, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) doubt.
Whatever else she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was inwardly assured. It was almost as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had gained HERSELF, and stood now distinct and complete. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had
received her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) confirmation; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) never believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) life belonged
to Paul Morel, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). They would separate in the end, and the
rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) life would be an ache after him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). But at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) knew
now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was sure of herself. And the same could almost be said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).
Together they had received the baptism of life, each through the other;
but now their missions were separate. Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wanted to go she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) could
not come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). They would have to part sooner or later. Even if they
married, and were faithful to each other, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would have to leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>), go on alone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) would only have to attend to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came
home. But it was not possible. Each wanted a mate to go side by side
with.

<p/>Clara had gone to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother upon Mapperley Plains. One
evening, as Paul and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) were walking along Woodborough Road, they met
Dawes. Morel knew something about the bearing of the man approaching,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) thinking at the moment, so that only his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
artist's eye watched the form of the stranger. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) suddenly turned
to Clara with a laugh, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shoulder, saying,
laughing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we walk side by side, and yet I'm in London arguing with an
imaginary Orpen; and where are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>At that instant Dawes passed, almost touching Morel. The young man
glanced, saw the dark brown eyes burning, full of hate and yet tired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked of Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Baxter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/>Paul took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shoulder and glanced round; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw
again distinctly the man's form as it approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Dawes still walked
erect, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fine shoulders flung back, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face lifted; but
there was a furtive look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes that gave one the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
trying to get unnoticed past every person he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) met, glancing suspiciously
to see what they thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). And his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands seemed to be wanting to
hide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wore old clothes, the trousers were torn at the knee, and the
handkerchief tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) throat was dirty; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cap was still
defiantly over one eye. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), Clara felt guilty. There was
a tiredness and despair on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), because it
hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) looks shady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>But the note of pity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) voice reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) feel
hard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) true commonness comes out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``about the cruelty of women; I wish you knew the
cruelty of men in their brute force. They simply don't know that the
woman exists.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I know you exist?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About ME you know nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said bitterly--<div class="bookquote">``about ME!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more than Baxter knew?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not as much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt puzzled, and helpless, and angry. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) walked unknown to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), though they had been through such experience together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you know ME pretty well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you know Baxter as well as you know me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) wouldn't let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have let you know me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It's what men WON<div class="bookquote">``T let you do. They won't let you get really near to
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And haven't I let you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered slowly; <div class="bookquote">``but you've never come near to me. You can't
come out of yourself, you can't. Baxter could do that better than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walked on pondering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) for preferring Baxter to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You begin to value Baxter now you've not got him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I can only see where he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) was different from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had a grudge against him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>).

<p/>One evening, as they were coming home over the fields, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)
by asking:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it's worth it--the--the sex part?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The act of loving, itself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; is it worth anything to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can you separate it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's the culmination of
everything. All our intimacy culminates then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) was silent. A flash of hate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) came up. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was
dissatisfied with him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>), even there, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) thought they fulfilled each
other. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) too implicitly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) continued slowly, <div class="bookquote">``as if I hadn't got you, as if all of
you weren't there, and as if it weren't ME you were taking--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something just for yourself. It has been fine, so that I daren't think
of it. But is it ME you want, or is it IT?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) again felt guilty. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) leave Clara out of count, and take simply
women? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) thought that was splitting a hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I had Baxter, actually had him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>), then I DID feel as if I had all of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it was better?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; it was more whole. I don't say you haven't given me more than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) ever gave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or could give you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps; but you've never given me yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) brows angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I start to make love to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I just go like a leaf down
the wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And leave me out of count,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then is it nothing to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) asked, almost rigid with chagrin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's something; and sometimes you have carried me away--right away--I
know--and--I reverence you for it--but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't `but' me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) said, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) quickly, as a fire ran through
him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) submitted, and was silent.

<p/>It was true as he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) said. As a rule, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) started love-making, the
emotion was strong enough to carry with it everything--reason, soul,
blood--in a great sweep, like the Trent carries bodily its back-swirls
and intertwinings, noiselessly. Gradually the little criticisms, the
little sensations, were lost, thought also went, everything borne along
in one flood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) became, not a man with a mind, but a great instinct.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) hands were like creatures, living; his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) limbs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) body, were
all life and consciousness, subject to no will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>), but living in
themselves. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) was, so it seemed the vigorous, wintry stars were
strong also with life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) and they struck with the same pulse of fire,
and the same joy of strength which held the bracken-frond stiff near
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) eyes held his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) own body firm. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>), and the stars, and the
dark herbage, and Clara were licked up in an immense tongue of flame,
which tore onwards and upwards. Everything rushed along in living beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>); everything was still, perfect in itself, along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>). This
wonderful stillness in each thing in itself, while it was being borne
along in a very ecstasy of living, seemed the highest point of bliss.

<p/>And Clara knew this held him (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) trusted altogether to the
passion. It, however, failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) very often. They did not often reach
again the height of that once when the peewits had called. Gradually,
some mechanical effort spoilt their loving, or, when they had splendid
moments, they had them separately, and not so satisfactorily. So often
he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) seemed merely to be running on alone; often they realised it had been
a failure, not what they had wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), knowing THAT evening
had only made a little split between them. Their loving grew more
mechanical, without the marvellous glamour. Gradually they began to
introduce novelties, to get back some of the feeling of satisfaction.
They would be very near, almost dangerously near to the river, so that
the black water ran not far from his (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) face, and it gave a little thrill;
or they loved sometimes in a little hollow below the fence of the path
where people were passing occasionally, on the edge of the town, and
they heard footsteps coming, almost felt the vibration of the tread,
and they heard what the passersby said--strange little things that
were never intended to be heard. And afterwards each of them was rather
ashamed, and these things caused a distance between the two of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>)
began to despise her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) a little, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had merited it!

<p/>One night he (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to go to Daybrook Station over the fields. It
was very dark, with an attempt at snow, although the spring was so far
advanced. Morel had not much time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) plunged forward. The town ceases
almost abruptly on the edge of a steep hollow; there the houses with
their yellow lights stand up against the darkness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went over the
stile, and dropped quickly into the hollow of the fields. Under the
orchard one warm window shone in Swineshead Farm. Paul glanced round.
Behind, the houses stood on the brim of the dip, black against the
sky, like wild beasts glaring curiously with yellow eyes down into the
darkness. It was the town that seemed savage and uncouth, glaring on the
clouds at the back of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Some creature stirred under the willows of
the farm pond. It was too dark to distinguish anything.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was close up to the next stile before he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw a dark shape leaning
against it. The man moved aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Morel answered, not noticing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul Morel?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew it was Dawes. The man stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got yer, have I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said awkwardly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall miss my train,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could see nothing of Dawes's face. The man's teeth seemed to chatter
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going to get it from me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/>Morel attempted to move forward; the other man stepped in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are yer goin' to take that top-coat off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or are you goin' to
lie down to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul was afraid the man was mad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how to fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>answered Dawes, and before the younger man knew where
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was staggering backwards from a blow across the face.

<p/>The whole night went black. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tore off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overcoat and coat, dodging
a blow, and flung the garments over Dawes. The latter swore savagely.
Morel, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shirt-sleeves, was now alert and furious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
whole body unsheath itself like a claw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not fight, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would
use his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wits. The other man became more distinct to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see
particularly the shirt-breast. Dawes stumbled over Paul's coats, then
came rushing forward. The young man's mouth was bleeding. It was the
other man's mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dying to get at, and the desire was anguish
in its strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped quickly through the stile, and as Dawes was
coming through after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), like a flash he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got a blow in over the other's
mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shivered with pleasure. Dawes advanced slowly, spitting. Paul
was afraid; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) moved round to get to the stile again. Suddenly, from
out of nowhere, came a great blow against his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ear, that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) falling
helpless backwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard Dawes's heavy panting, like a wild beast's,
then came a kick on the knee, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) such agony that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got up and,
quite blind, leapt clean under his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) enemy's guard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt blows and
kicks, but they did not hurt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hung on to the bigger man like a wild
cat, till at last Dawes fell with a crash, losing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence of mind.
Paul went down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Pure instinct brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands to the man's
neck, and before Dawes, in frenzy and agony, could wrench him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) free,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fists twisted in the scarf and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knuckles dug in the
throat of the other man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a pure instinct, without reason or
feeling. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body, hard and wonderful in itself, cleaved against the
struggling body of the other man; not a muscle in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relaxed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
quite unconscious, only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body had taken upon itself to kill this
other man. For himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had neither feeling nor reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay
pressed hard against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adversary, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body adjusting itself to its one
pure purpose of choking the other man, resisting exactly at the right
moment, with exactly the right amount of strength, the struggles of
the other, silent, intent, unchanging, gradually pressing its knuckles
deeper, feeling the struggles of the other body become wilder and
more frenzied. Tighter and tighter grew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body, like a screw that is
gradually increasing in pressure, till something breaks.

<p/>Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relaxed, full of wonder and misgiving. Dawes had been
yielding. Morel felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) body flame with pain, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) realised what he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was doing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was all bewildered. Dawes's struggles suddenly renewed
themselves in a furious spasm. Paul's hands were wrenched, torn out of
the scarf in which they were knotted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was flung away, helpless.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard the horrid sound of the other's gasping, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lay stunned;
then, still dazed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt the blows of the other's feet, and lost
consciousness.

<p/>Dawes, grunting with pain like a beast, was kicking the prostrate body
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rival. Suddenly the whistle of the train shrieked two fields
away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned round and glared suspiciously. What was coming? He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw
the lights of the train draw across his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) vision. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) people
were approaching. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made off across the field into Nottingham, and
dimly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) consciousness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) foot the place
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) boot had knocked against one of the lad's bones. The knock
seemed to re-echo inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hurried to get away from it.

<p/>Morel gradually came to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was and what had
happened, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not want to move. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lay still, with tiny bits of
snow tickling his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face. It was pleasant to lie quite, quite still. The
time passed. It was the bits of snow that kept rousing him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did
not want to be roused. At last his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) will clicked into action.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mustn't lie here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it's silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I was going to get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And still it was some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had sufficiently pulled himself
together to stir; then gradually he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) got up. Pain made him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sick and
dazed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) brain was clear. Reeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) groped for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) coats and got
them on, buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) overcoat up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) ears. It was some time before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) cap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not know whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face was still bleeding.
Walking blindly, every step making him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sick with pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went back to
the pond and washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face and hands. The icy water hurt, but helped
to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) back to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) crawled back up the hill to the tram.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wanted to get to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mother--he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) must get to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mother--that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
blind intention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could, and struggled
sickly along. Continually the ground seemed to fall away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) walked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt himself dropping with a sickening feeling into
space; so, like a nightmare, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) got through with the journey home.

<p/>Everybody was in bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked at himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face was discoloured
and smeared with blood, almost like a dead man's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) washed it, and
went to bed. The night went by in delirium. In the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
mother looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blue eyes--they were all he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wanted to see.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not much, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It was Baxter Dawes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me where it hurts you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--my shoulder. Say it was a bicycle accident, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not move his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) arm. Presently Minnie, the little servant, came
upstairs with some tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother's nearly frightened me out of my wits--fainted away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>)
said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not bear it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mother nursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) about
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I should have done with them all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) covered him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't think about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``only try to go to sleep. The
doctor won't be here till eleven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had a dislocated shoulder, and the second day acute bronchitis set
in. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mother was pale as death now, and very thin. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would sit and
look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), then away into space. There was something between them that
neither dared mention. Clara came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
mother:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) makes me tired, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wouldn't come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Morel replied.

<p/>Another day Miriam came, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed almost like a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, I don't care about them, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you don't, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied sadly.

<p/>It was given out everywhere that it was a bicycle accident. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
was able to go to work again, but now there was a constant sickness and
gnawing at his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) went to Clara, but there seemed, as it were,
nobody there. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could not work. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mother seemed almost to
avoid each other. There was some secret between them which they could
not bear. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was not aware of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) only knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) life seemed
unbalanced, as if it were going to smash into pieces.

<p/>Clara did not know what was the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) realised that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
seemed unaware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) seemed unaware of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); always he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was somewhere else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was clutching for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was somewhere else. It tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). For
a month at a time she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) at arm's length. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) almost hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and
was driven to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in spite of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) went mostly into the company
of men, was always at the George or the White Horse. His (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) mother was ill,
distant, quiet, shadowy. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was terrified of something; he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) dared not
look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes seemed to grow darker, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face more waxen; still
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dragged about at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) work.

<p/>At Whitsuntide he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) would go to Blackpool for four days with his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
friend Newton. The latter was a big, jolly fellow, with a touch of the
bounder about him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>). Paul said his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother must go to Sheffield to stay a
week with Annie, who lived there. Perhaps the change would do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) good.
Mrs. Morel was attending a woman's doctor in Nottingham. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
heart and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) digestion were wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) consented to go to Sheffield,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not want to; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would do everything her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son
wished of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Paul said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would come for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) on the fifth day, and
stay also in Sheffield till the holiday was up. It was agreed.

<p/>The two young men set off gaily for Blackpool. Mrs. Morel was quite
lively as Paul kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Once at the station, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) forgot
everything. Four days were clear--not an anxiety, not a thought. The two
young men simply enjoyed themselves. Paul was like another man. None of
himself remained--no Clara, no Miriam, no mother that fretted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
wrote to them all, and long letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother; but they were jolly
letters that made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was having a good time, as young fellows
will in a place like Blackpool. And underneath it all was a shadow for
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>Paul was very gay, excited at the thought of staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother in
Sheffield. Newton was to spend the day with them. Their train was late.
Joking, laughing, with their pipes between their teeth, the young men
swung their bags on to the tram-car. Paul had bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother a little
collar of real lace that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wear, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could
tease her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) about it.

<p/>Annie lived in a nice house, and had a little maid. Paul ran gaily up
the steps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) expected his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother laughing in the hall, but it was
Annie who opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) seemed distant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood a second in
dismay. Annie let him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is my mother ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not very well. Don't upset her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>And then the queer feeling went over him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), as if all the sunshine had
gone out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and it was all shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dropped the bag and ran
upstairs. Hesitating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) opened the door. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother sat up in bed,
wearing a dressing-gown of old-rose colour. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) almost as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were ashamed of herself, pleading to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), humble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw the ashy
look about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were never coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered gaily.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) only fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knees at the bedside, and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face in the
bedclothes, crying in agony, and saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother--mother--mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hair slowly with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thin hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Don't cry--it's nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood was melting into tears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried in
terror and pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't--don't cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother faltered.

<p/>Slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hair. Shocked out of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried, and the
tears hurt in every fibre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) body. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stopped, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dared
not lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face out of the bedclothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ARE late. Where have you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The train was late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied, muffled in the sheet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that miserable Central! Is Newton come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you must be hungry, and they've kept dinner waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a wrench he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked brutally.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) averted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a bit of a tumour, my boy. You needn't trouble. It's been
there--the lump has--a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Up came the tears again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mind was clear and hard, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) body was
crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here. But you know they can sweal a tumour away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood feeling dazed and helpless, like a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought perhaps it
was as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) reassured himself it was so. But all the while
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) body knew definitely what it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat down on
the bed, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never had but the one ring--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wedding-ring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When were you poorly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was yesterday it began,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered submissively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pains?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but not more than I've often had at home. I believe Dr. Ansell is
an alarmist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought not to have travelled alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, to himself more than
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As if that had anything to do with it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered quickly.

<p/>They were silent for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now go and have your dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You MUST be hungry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you had yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; a beautiful sole I had. Annie IS good to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They talked a little while, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went downstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was very white
and strained. Newton sat in miserable sympathy.

<p/>After dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) went into the scullery to help Annie to wash up. The
little maid had gone on an errand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it really a tumour?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Annie began to cry again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) had yesterday--I never saw anybody suffer like it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
cried. ``Leonard ran like a madman for Dr. Ansell, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'d got to
bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said to me: ``Annie, look at this lump on my side. I wonder what
it is?'' And there I looked, and I thought I should have dropped. Paul,
as true as I'm here, it's a lump as big as my double fist. I said: ``Good
gracious, mother, whenever did that come?'' ``Why, child,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said, `it's
been there a long time.''  (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div>I thought I should have died, our Paul, I did.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'s been having these pains for months at home, and nobody looking
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).''

<p/>The tears came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes, then dried suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s been attending the doctor in Nottingham--and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never told
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'd have been at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie, <div class="bookquote">``I should have seen for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt like a man walking in unrealities. In the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went to
see the doctor. The latter was a shrewd, lovable man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>The doctor looked at the young man, then knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be a large tumour which has formed in the membrane,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said
slowly, <div class="bookquote">``and which we MAY be able to make go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you operate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``QUITE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul meditated a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure it's a tumour?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Why did Dr. Jameson in
Nottingham never find out anything about it? She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s been going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jameson</b></font>) for
weeks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jameson</b></font>)'s treated her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for heart and indigestion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Morel never told Dr. Jameson about the lump,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you KNOW it's a tumour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else MIGHT it be? You asked my sister if there was cancer in the
family. Might it be cancer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what shall you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like an examination, with Dr. Jameson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then have one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must arrange about that. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jameson</b></font>) fee wouldn't be less than ten guineas
to come here from Nottingham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When would you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Jameson</b></font>) to come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will call in this evening, and we will talk it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul went away, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lip.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother could come downstairs for tea, the doctor said. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son went
upstairs to help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wore the old-rose dressing-gown that Leonard
had given Annie, and, with a little colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) face, was quite young
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you look quite pretty in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; they make me so fine, I hardly know myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) answered.

<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) stood up to walk, the colour went. Paul helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>),
half-carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). At the top of the stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
up and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) quickly downstairs; laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) on the couch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was
light and frail. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) face looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) were dead, with blue lips
shut tight. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) eyes opened--her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) blue, unfailing eyes--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pleadingly, almost wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held brandy to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) lips, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mouth would not open. All the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
lovingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was only sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face
without ceasing, but not a muscle moved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was intent on getting
a little brandy between her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) lips. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was able to swallow a
teaspoonful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) lay back, so tired. The tears continued to run down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) panted, <div class="bookquote">``it'll go off. Don't cry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was better again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was kneeling beside the couch.
They looked into each other's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to make a trouble of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mother. You'll have to be quite still, and then you'll get better
soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was white to the lips, and their eyes as they looked at each
other understood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) eyes were so blue--such a wonderful forget-me-not
blue! He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt if only they had been of a different colour he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could have
borne it better. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart seemed to be ripping slowly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
kneeled there, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) hand, and neither said anything. Then Annie
came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) murmured timidly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Morel.

<p/>Paul sat down and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) about Blackpool. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was curious.

<p/>A day or two after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went to see Dr. Jameson in Nottingham, to arrange
for a consultation. Paul had practically no money in the world. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
could borrow.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother had been used to go to the public consultation on Saturday
morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could see the doctor for only a nominal sum. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son
went on the same day. The waiting-room was full of poor women, who sat
patiently on a bench around the wall. Paul thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
little black costume, sitting waiting likewise. The doctor was late. The
women all looked rather frightened. Paul asked the nurse in attendance
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could see the doctor immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came. It was arranged so. The
women sitting patiently round the walls of the room eyed the young man
curiously.

<p/>At last the doctor came. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was about forty, good-looking,
brown-skinned. His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife had died, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), who had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), had
specialised on women's ailments. Paul told his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) name and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's.
The doctor did not remember.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Number forty-six M.,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse doctor</b></font>)</div>said the nurse; and the doctor looked up the case
in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a big lump that may be a tumour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``But Dr. Ansell
was going to write you a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor, drawing the letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was very friendly, affable, busy, kind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would come to Sheffield the
next day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a coal-miner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very well off, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This--I see after this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>smiled the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a clerk in Jordan's Appliance Factory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er--to go to Sheffield!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, putting the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) fingers
together, and smiling with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Eight guineas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, flushing and rising. <div class="bookquote">``And you'll come
to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow--Sunday? Yes! Can you tell me about what time there is a
train in the afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a Central gets in at four-fifteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will there be any way of getting up to the house? Shall I have to
walk?''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>The doctor smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is the tram,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul; <div class="bookquote">``the Western Park tram.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor made a note of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, and shook hands.

<p/>Then Paul went on home to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father, who was left in the charge of
Minnie. Walter Morel was getting very grey now. Paul found him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) digging
in the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had written him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shook hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, son! Tha has landed, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>replied the son. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm going back to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ter, beguy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the collier</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the collier. <div class="bookquote">``An' has ter eaten owt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just like thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``Come thy ways in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/>The father was afraid of the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife. The two went indoors.
Paul ate in silence; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father, with earthy hands, and sleeves rolled
up, sat in the arm-chair opposite and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, an' how is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>asked the miner at length, in a little voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can sit up; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can be carried down for tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a blessin'!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I hope we s'll soon be havin' her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
whoam, then. An' what's that Nottingham doctor say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s going to-morrow to have an examination of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) beguy! That's a tidy penny, I'm thinkin'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eight guineas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eight guineas!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miner</b></font>)</div>the miner spoke breathlessly. <div class="bookquote">``Well, we mun find it
from somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can pay that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>There was silence between them for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hopes you're getting on all right with Minnie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm all right, an' I wish as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>answered Morel. <div class="bookquote">``But
Minnie's a good little wench, bless `er heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat looking dismal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll have to be going at half-past three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a trapse for thee, lad! Eight guineas! An' when dost think she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>)'ll
be able to get as far as this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must see what the doctors say to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul said.

<p/>Morel sighed deeply. The house seemed strangely empty, and Paul thought
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father looked lost, forlorn, and old.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) next week, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>)'ll be a-whoam by that time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>)'s not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``then you must come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno wheer I s'll find th' money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll write to you what the doctor says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But tha writes i' such a fashion, I canna ma'e it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll write plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>It was no good asking Morel to answer, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could scarcely do more
than write his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own name.

<p/>The doctor came. Leonard felt it his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) duty to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) with a cab. The
examination did not take long. Annie, Arthur, Paul, and Leonard were
waiting in the parlour anxiously. The doctors came down. Paul glanced at
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had never had any hope, except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had deceived himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It MAY be a tumour; we must wait and see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Jameson</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Jameson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie, <div class="bookquote">``can you sweal it away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/>Paul put eight sovereigns and half a sovereign on the table. The doctor
counted them, took a florin out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) purse, and put that down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry Mrs. Morel is so ill. But we must see
what we can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can't be an operation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>The doctor shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and even if there could, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart wouldn't stand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart risky?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you must be careful with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very risky?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--er--no, no! Just take care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>And the doctor was gone.

<p/>Then Paul carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother downstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lay simply, like a
child. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was on the stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) neck,
clinging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so frightened of these beastly stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was frightened, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would let Leonard do it another time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could not carry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thinks it's only a tumour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>cried Annie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can
sweal it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I KNEW he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>protested Mrs. Morel scornfully.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pretended not to notice that Paul had gone out of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat
in the kitchen, smoking. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tried to brush some grey ash off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked again. It was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother's grey hairs. It was
so long! He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) held it up, and it drifted into the chimney. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) let go. The
long grey hair floated and was gone in the blackness of the chimney.

<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before going back to work. It was very early
in the morning, and they were alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't fret, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it would be silly. And take care of yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) answered. Then, after a while: <div class="bookquote">``And I shall come next
Saturday, and shall bring my father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does
you'll have to let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again, and stroked the hair from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) temples, gently,
tenderly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were a lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't you be late?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, very low.

<p/>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sat a few minutes, stroking the brown and grey hair from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
temples.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you won't be any worse, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You promise me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I won't be any worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arms for a moment, and was gone. In the
early sunny morning he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) ran to the station, crying all the way; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
did not know what for. And her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blue eyes were wide and staring as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>).

<p/>In the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went a walk with Clara. They sat in the little wood
where bluebells were standing. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said to Clara, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll never be better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) caught him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) impulsively to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try and forget it, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``try and forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast was there, warm for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hands were in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hair. It was
comforting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did not forget. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
only talked to Clara of something else. And it was always so. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
felt it coming, the agony, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cried to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of it, Paul! Don't think of it, my darling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) breast, rocked him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) like a
child. So he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) put the trouble aside for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sake, to take it up again
immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was alone. All the time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went about, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cried
mechanically. His (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mind and hands were busy. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cried, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did not know
why. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) blood weeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was just as much alone whether he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was
with Clara or with the men in the White Horse. Just himself and this
pressure inside him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), that was all that existed. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) read sometimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
had to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) mind occupied. And Clara was a way of occupying his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
mind.

<p/>On the Saturday Walter Morel went to Sheffield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was a forlorn figure,
looking rather as if nobody owned him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Paul ran upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father's come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered wearily.

<p/>The old collier came rather frightened into the bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dun I find thee, lass?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) said, going forward and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in a
hasty, timid fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm middlin',''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see tha art,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) stood looking down on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) wiped
his (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) handkerchief. Helpless, and as if nobody owned him (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>)
looked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you gone on all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>asked the wife, rather wearily, as if it
were an effort to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">''`Er's a bit behint-hand now and again, as yer might
expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) have your dinner ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morel/Morel/MOREL</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've `ad to shout at `er once or twice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you MUST shout at her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)'s not ready. She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) WILL leave things to
the last minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) a few instructions. He (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) sat looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were
almost a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>), before whom he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) was awkward and humble, and
also as if he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) presence of mind, and wanted to run. This
feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) wanted to run away, that he (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) was on thorns to be gone
from so trying a situation, and yet must linger because it looked
better, made his (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) presence so trying. He (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) eyebrows for misery,
and clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) fists on his (<font color='blue'><b>collier</b></font>) knees, feeling so awkward in presence of
big trouble.

<p/>Mrs. Morel did not change much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stayed in Sheffield for two months.
If anything, at the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was rather worse. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wanted to go home.
Annie had her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) children. Mrs. Morel wanted to go home. So they got a
motor-car from Nottingham--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was too ill to go by train--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was driven through the sunshine. It was just August; everything was
bright and warm. Under the blue sky they could all see she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was dying.
Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was jollier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had been for weeks. They all laughed and
talked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I saw a lizard dart on that rock!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes were so quick; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was still so full of life.

<p/>Morel knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was coming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had the front door open. Everybody was on
tiptoe. Half the street turned out. They heard the sound of the great
motor-car. Mrs. Morel, smiling, drove home down the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And just look at them all come out to see me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But there,
I suppose I should have done the same. How do you do, Mrs. Mathews? How
are you, Mrs. Harrison?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They none of them could hear, but they saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) smile and nod. And
they all saw death on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face, they said. It was a great event in the
street.

<p/>Morel wanted to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) indoors, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was too old. Arthur took her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were a child. They had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) a big, deep chair by the
hearth where her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rocking-chair used to stand. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was unwrapped and
seated, and had drunk a little brandy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked round the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think I don't like your house, Annie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but it's nice
to be in my own home again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And Morel answered huskily:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, lass, it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>And Minnie, the little quaint maid, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' we glad t' `ave yer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a lovely yellow ravel of sunflowers in the garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) looked
out of the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are my sunflowers!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) said.



<p/>CHAPTER XIV

<p/>THE RELEASE

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Ansell</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Ansell one evening when Morel was in
Sheffield, <div class="bookquote">``we've got a man in the fever hospital here who comes from
Nottingham--Dawes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't seem to have many belongings in this
world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Baxter Dawes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the man--has been a fine fellow, physically, I should think.
Been in a bit of a mess lately. You know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to work at the place where I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Do you know anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s just sulking, or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d be a
lot better than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is by now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home circumstances, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s

about me, will you? Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I'll come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>The next time Morel saw the doctor he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about Dawes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other, <div class="bookquote">''`Do you know a man from Nottingham
named Morel?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked at me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)'d jump at my throat. So I
said: <div class="bookquote">``I see you know the name; it's Paul Morel.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) about
your saying you would go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) want?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, as
if you were a policeman.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) say he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wouldn't say anything--good, bad or indifferent,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the
doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I want to know. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lies and sulks, day in, day out.
Can't get a word of information out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I might go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a feeling of connection between the rival men, more than ever
since they had fought. In a way Morel felt guilty towards the other, and
more or less responsible. And being in such a state of soul himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt an almost painful nearness to Dawes, who was suffering and
despairing, too. Besides, they had met in a naked extremity of hate, and
it was a bond. At any rate, the elemental man in each had met.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went down to the isolation hospital, with Dr. Ansell's card. This
sister, a healthy young Irishwoman, led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down the ward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A visitor to see you, Jim Crow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said.

<p/>Dawes turned over suddenly with a startled grunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caw!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mocked. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Crow</b></font>) can only say ``Caw!'' I have brought you a
gentleman to see you. Now say ``Thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' and show some manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes looked swiftly with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dark, startled eyes beyond the sister at
Paul. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) look was full of fear, mistrust, hate, and misery. Morel met
the swift, dark eyes, and hesitated. The two men were afraid of the
naked selves they had been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Ansell told me you were here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Dawes mechanically shook hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I thought I'd come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>continued Paul.

<p/>There was no answer. Dawes lay staring at the opposite wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say `Caw!'' (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>' mocked the nurse. ``Say ``Caw!<div class="bookquote">'' Jim Crow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Crow</b></font>) is getting on all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! He (<font color='blue'><b>Crow</b></font>) lies and imagines he (<font color='blue'><b>Crow</b></font>)'s going to die,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse, <div class="bookquote">``and
it frightens every word out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crow</b></font>) mouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you MUST have somebody to talk to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>laughed Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>laughed the nurse. ``Only two old men and a boy who always
cries. It is hard lines! Here am I dying to hear Jim Crow's voice, and
nothing but an odd ``Caw!<div class="bookquote">'' will he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) give!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So rough on you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am a godsend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dropped straight from heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>laughed the nurse.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) left the two men alone. Dawes was thinner, and handsome
again, but life seemed low in him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). As the doctor said, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was lying
sulking, and would not move forward towards convalescence. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) seemed to
grudge every beat of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you had a bad time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/>Suddenly again Dawes looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing in Sheffield?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother was taken ill at my sister's in Thurston Street. What are you
doing here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long have you been in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Morel asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't say for sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Dawes answered grudgingly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lay staring across at the wall opposite, as if trying to believe
Morel was not there. Paul felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart go hard and angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Ansell told me you were here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said coldly.

<p/>The other man did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Typhoid's pretty bad, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Morel persisted.

<p/>Suddenly Dawes said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you come for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because Dr. Ansell said you didn't know anybody here. Do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nobody nowhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``it's because you don't choose to, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We s'll be taking my mother home as soon as we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a-matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>asked Dawes, with a sick man's interest in
illness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got a cancer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we want to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``We s'll have to get a
motor-car.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes lay thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you ask Thomas Jordan to lend you his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not big enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Morel answered.

<p/>Dawes blinked his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dark eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lay thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then ask Jack Pilkington; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d lend it you. You know him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I s'll hire one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a fool if you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/>The sick man was gaunt and handsome again. Paul was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes looked so tired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you get a job here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only here a day or two before I was taken bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Dawes replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to get in a convalescent home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>The other's face clouded again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm goin' in no convalescent home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father's been in the one at Seathorpe, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) liked it. Dr. Ansell
would get you a recommend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes lay thinking. It was evident he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dared not face the world again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The seaside would be all right just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Morel said. <div class="bookquote">``Sun on those
sandhills, and the waves not far out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Gad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul concluded, too miserable to bother much; <div class="bookquote">``it's all right
when you know you're going to walk again, and swim!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) quickly. The man's dark eyes were afraid to meet
any other eyes in the world. But the real misery and helplessness in
Paul's tone gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a feeling of relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) far gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s going like wax,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul answered; <div class="bookquote">``but cheerful--lively!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lip. After a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you this half-crown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Dawes muttered.

<p/>Morel did not answer, but left the coin on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll try and run in when I'm back in Sheffield. Happen
you might like to see my brother-in-law? He (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) works in Pyecrofts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)'s all right. Should I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) to come? He (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) might bring you some
papers to look at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The other man did not answer. Paul went. The strong emotion that Dawes
aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), repressed, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shiver.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, but next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spoke to Clara about this
interview. It was in the dinner-hour. The two did not often go out
together now, but this day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to the Castle
grounds. There they sat while the scarlet geraniums and the yellow
calceolarias blazed in the sunlight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was now always rather
protective, and rather resentful towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you know Baxter was in Sheffield Hospital with typhoid?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with startled grey eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face went pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)'s getting better. I went to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) yesterday--the doctor told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara seemed stricken by the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) very bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked guiltily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has been. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s mending now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) say to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing! He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) seems to be sulking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a distance between the two of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) more
information.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) went about shut up and silent. The next time they took a walk
together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) disengaged herself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arm, and walked at a distance
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was wanting her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) comfort badly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you be nice with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arm across her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, disengaging herself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) alone, and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own brooding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Baxter that upsets you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked at length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I HAVE been VILE to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've said many a time you haven't treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/>And there was a hostility between them. Each pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own train of
thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>)--no, I've treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) badly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And now you
treat ME badly. It serves me right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do I treat you badly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It serves me right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``I never considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) worth
having, and now you don't consider ME. But it serves me right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) loved
me a thousand times better than you ever did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) didn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>protested Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) did! At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) did respect me, and that's what you don't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) respected you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) did! And I MADE him (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) horrid--I know I did! You've taught me that. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baxter</b></font>) loved me a thousand times better than ever you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) only wanted to be left alone now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own trouble, which was
almost too much to bear. Clara only tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was not sorry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) went on the first opportunity to Sheffield to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) husband. The
meeting was not a success. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) roses and fruit and money.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to make restitution. It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lying there her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) heart did not warm with love. Only she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
wanted to humble herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), to kneel before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted now to
be self-sacrificial. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had failed to make Morel really
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was morally frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to do penance. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
kneeled to Dawes, and it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) a subtle pleasure. But the distance
between them was still very great--too great. It frightened the man. It
almost pleased the woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked to feel she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was serving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) across
an insuperable distance. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was proud now.

<p/>Morel went to see Dawes once or twice. There was a sort of friendship
between the two men, who were all the while deadly rivals. But they
never mentioned the woman who was between them.

<p/>Mrs. Morel got gradually worse. At first they used to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
downstairs, sometimes even into the garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat propped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
chair, smiling, and so pretty. The gold wedding-ring shone on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
white hand; her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hair was carefully brushed. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) watched the tangled
sunflowers dying, the chrysanthemums coming out, and the dahlias.

<p/>Paul and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were afraid of each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
was dying. But they kept up a pretence of cheerfulness. Every morning,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pyjamas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you sleep, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had lain awake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hand under the bedclothes,
pressing the place on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) side where the pain was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it been bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. It hurt a bit, but nothing to mention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sniffed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) old scornful way. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lay she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked like a
girl. And all the while her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) blue eyes watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). But there were the
dark pain-circles beneath that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ache again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a sunny day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a beautiful day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think you'll be carried down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went away to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) breakfast. All day long he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was conscious of
nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). It was a long ache that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feverish. Then, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got home in the early evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) glanced through the kitchen window.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was not there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had not got up.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ran straight upstairs and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was almost afraid to ask:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you get up, pigeon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it was that morphia; it made me tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) gives you too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat down by the bed, miserably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had a way of curling and lying on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) side, like a child. The grey and brown hair was loose over her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it tickle you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, gently putting it back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face was near hers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) blue eyes smiled straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), like a
girl's--warm, laughing with tender love. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pant with terror,
agony, and love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want your hair doing in a plait,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Lie still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And going behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) carefully loosened her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hair, brushed it out. It
was like fine long silk of brown and grey. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) head was snuggled between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shoulders. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lightly brushed and plaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
lip and felt dazed. It all seemed unreal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not understand it.

<p/>At night he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) often worked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) room, looking up from time to time. And
so often he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) blue eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). And when their eyes met,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) worked away again mechanically, producing good stuff
without knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was doing.

<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came in, very pale and still, with watchful, sudden eyes,
like a man who is drunk almost to death. They were both afraid of the
veils that were ripping between them.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pretended to be better, chattered to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gaily, made a great
fuss over some scraps of news. For they had both come to the condition
when they had to make much of the trifles, lest they should give in to
the big thing, and their human independence would go smash. They were
afraid, so they made light of things and were gay.

<p/>Sometimes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lay he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was thinking of the past. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mouth
gradually shut hard in a line. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was holding herself rigid, so that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) might die without ever uttering the great cry that was tearing from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never forgot that hard, utterly lonely and stubborn clenching
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mouth, which persisted for weeks. Sometimes, when it was lighter,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) talked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not forgive
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could not bear him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be in the room. And a few things, the
things that had been most bitter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), came up again so strongly that
they broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life were being destroyed, piece by piece, within him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
Often the tears came suddenly. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ran to the station, the tear-drops
falling on the pavement. Often he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could not go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) work. The
pen stopped writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sat staring, quite unconscious. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) came
round again he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt sick, and trembled in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) limbs. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) never questioned
what it was. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mind did not try to analyse or understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) merely
submitted, and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes shut; let the thing go over him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother did the same. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought of the pain, of the morphia, of the
next day; hardly ever of the death. That was coming, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
to submit to it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never entreat it or make friends with
it. Blind, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face shut hard and blind, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was pushed towards the
door. The days passed, the weeks, the months.

<p/>Sometimes, in the sunny afternoons, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed almost happy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I try to think of the nice times--when we went to Mablethorpe, and
Robin Hood's Bay, and Shanklin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``After all, not everybody has
seen those beautiful places. And wasn't it beautiful! I try to think of
that, not of the other things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, again, for a whole evening she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke not a word; neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
They were together, rigid, stubborn, silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) room
at last to go to bed, and leaned against the doorway as if paralysed,
unable to go any farther. His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) consciousness went. A furious storm, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
knew not what, seemed to ravage inside him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood leaning there,
submitting, never questioning.

<p/>In the morning they were both normal again, though her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face was grey
with the morphia, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) body felt like ash. But they were bright
again, nevertheless. Often, especially if Annie or Arthur were at home,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did not see much of Clara. Usually he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was with
men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was quick and active and lively; but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) friends saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
go white to the gills, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes dark and glittering, they had a certain
mistrust of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went to Clara, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was almost cold to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said simply.

<p/>Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was afraid. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) then,
there was something in it that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) shrink away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)--something
unnatural. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) grew to dread him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was so quiet, yet so strange. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
was afraid of the man who was not there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could feel
behind this make-belief lover; somebody sinister, that filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with
horror. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) began to have a kind of horror of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). It was almost as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were a criminal. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)--and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) feel as
if death itself had her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in its grip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lay in horror. There was no
man there loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) almost hated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Then came little bouts of
tenderness. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) dared not pity him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Dawes had come to Colonel Seely's Home near Nottingham. There Paul
visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sometimes, Clara very occasionally. Between the two men
the friendship developed peculiarly. Dawes, who mended very slowly and
seemed very feeble, seemed to leave himself in the hands of Morel.

<p/>In the beginning of November Clara reminded Paul that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
birthday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd nearly forgotten,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd thought quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Shall we go to the seaside for the week-end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went. It was cold and rather dismal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to be warm
and tender with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), instead of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed hardly aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat in the railway-carriage, looking out, and was startled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was not definitely thinking. Things seemed as if they
did not exist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) went across to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Don't those windmill sails look monotonous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not talk nor think. It was a comfort,
however, to sit holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was dissatisfied and miserable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was nothing.

<p/>And in the evening they sat among the sandhills, looking at the black,
heavy sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mablethorpe</b></font>) will never give in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/>Clara's heart sank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are different ways of dying. My father's people are frightened,
and have to be hauled out of life into death like cattle into a
slaughter-house, pulled by the neck; but my mother's people are pushed
from behind, inch by inch. They are stubborn people, and won't die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara.

<p/>``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) won't die. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can't. Mr. Renshaw, the parson, was in the other
day. ``Think!<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); `you will have your mother and father, and
your sisters, and your son, in the Other Land.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I have
done without them for a long time, and CAN do without them now. It is
the living I want, not the dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wants to live even now.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how horrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara, too frightened to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looks at me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants to stay with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went on
monotonously. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got such a will, it seems as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never
go--never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>cried Clara.

<p/>``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was religious--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is religious now--but it is no good. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
simply won't give in. And do you know, I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on Thursday:
``Mother, if I had to die, I'd die. I'd WILL to die.'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said to
me, sharp: <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I haven't? Do you think you can die when you
like?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) voice ceased. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not cry, only went on speaking monotonously.
Clara wanted to run. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked round. There was the black, re-echoing
shore, the dark sky down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) got up terrified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to be
where there was light, where there were other people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to be
away from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) head dropped, not moving a muscle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, ``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) knows it. When I ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>): ``Shall you have anything' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s almost afraid to say <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>``I'll
have a cup of Benger``s,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) says. ``It'll only keep your strength up,''
I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). ``Yes'--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) almost cried--`but there's such a gnawing
when I eat nothing, I can't bear it.<div class="bookquote">'' So I went and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) the food.
It's the cancer that gnaws like that at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'d die!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Clara roughly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) down the darkness of the sands. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seemed scarcely aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) existence. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),
and disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).

<p/>In the same acute daze they went back to Nottingham. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was always
busy, always doing something, always going from one to the other of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
friends.

<p/>On the Monday he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went to see Baxter Dawes. Listless and pale, the man
rose to greet the other, clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Dawes sat down heavily, eyeing Morel with a sort of suspicion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you waste your time on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you've owt better to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``Here! I brought you some sweets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The invalid put them aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not been much of a week-end,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly any different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was perhaps worse, being as you didn't come on Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was at Skegness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted a change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The other looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with dark eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed to be waiting, not
quite daring to ask, trusting to be told.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went with Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew as much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was an old promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have it your own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/>This was the first time Clara had been definitely mentioned between
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel slowly; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'s tired of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Dawes looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since August she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'s been getting tired of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Morel repeated.

<p/>The two men were very quiet together. Paul suggested a game of draughts.
They played in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll go abroad when my mother's dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Abroad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>repeated Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I don't care what I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They continued the game. Dawes was winning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll have to begin a new start of some sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul; <div class="bookquote">``and you as
well, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took one of Dawes's pieces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno where,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Things have to happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Morel said. <div class="bookquote">``It's no good doing anything--at
least--no, I don't know. Give me some toffee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men ate sweets, and began another game of draughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What made that scar on your mouth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>asked Dawes.

<p/>Paul put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand hastily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips, and looked over the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a bicycle accident,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Dawes's hand trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) moved the piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't ha' laughed at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, very low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That night on Woodborough Road, when you and her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) passed me--you with
your hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shoulder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never laughed at you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Dawes kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers on the draught-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knew you were there till the very second when you passed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said
Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was that as did me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Dawes said, very low.

<p/>Paul took another sweet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never laughed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``except as I'm always laughing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They finished the game.

<p/>That night Morel walked home from Nottingham, in order to have something
to do. The furnaces flared in a red blotch over Bulwell; the black
clouds were like a low ceiling. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went along the ten miles of
highroad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) were walking out of life, between the black
levels of the sky and the earth. But at the end was only the sick-room.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) walked and walked for ever, there was only that place to come to.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was not tired when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) got near home, or He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not know it. Across
the field he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) could see the red firelight leaping in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bedroom window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``that fire will go out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) boots quietly and crept upstairs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) mothers door was
wide open, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) slept alone still. The red firelight dashed its
glow on the landing. Soft as a shadow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) peeped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart seemed to break again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went in and sat by the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How late you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what time is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The murmur came plaintive and helpless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only just gone eleven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That was not true; it was nearly one o'clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I thought it was later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew the unutterable misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) nights that would not go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you sleep, my pigeon?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wailed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Little!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said crooning. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, my love. I'll stop
with you half an hour, my pigeon; then perhaps it will be better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat by the bedside, slowly, rhythmically stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) brows
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) finger-tips, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes shut, soothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) free hand. They could hear the sleepers' breathing in the
other rooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) murmured, lying quite still under his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) fingers and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you sleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You feel better, my Little, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, like a fretful, half-soothed child.

<p/>Still the days and the weeks went by. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hardly ever went to see Clara
now. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wandered restlessly from one person to another for some
help, and there was none anywhere. Miriam had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) tenderly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) heart was very sore when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), white,
gaunt, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) eyes dark and bewildered. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pity came up, hurting her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not bear it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The same--the same!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The doctor says she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can't last, but I
know she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll be here at Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miriam/Miriam Leivers/MIRIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>Miriam shuddered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bosom; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) submitted, but it was torture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could
not kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) agony. That remained alone and apart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) face,
and roused his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) blood, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) soul was apart writhing with the agony
of death. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) and fingered his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) body, till at last,
feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would go mad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) got away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wanted
just then--not that. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) and done him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
good.

<p/>December came, and some snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) stayed at home all the while now.
They could not afford a nurse. Annie came to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother; the
parish nurse, whom they loved, came in morning and evening. Paul shared
the nursing with Annie. Often, in the evenings, when friends were in the
kitchen with them, they all laughed together and shook with laughter. It
was reaction. Paul was so comical, Annie was so quaint. The whole party
laughed till they cried, trying to subdue the sound. And Mrs. Morel,
lying alone in the darkness heard them, and among her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bitterness was a
feeling of relief.

<p/>Then Paul would go upstairs gingerly, guiltily, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I give you some milk?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) replied plaintively.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would put some water with it, so that it should not nourish her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).
Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own life.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had morphia every night, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) heart got fitful. Annie slept
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). Paul would go in in the early morning, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sister
got up. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother was wasted and almost ashen in the morning with the
morphia. Darker and darker grew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, all pupil, with the torture.
In the mornings the weariness and ache were too much to bear. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
could not--would not--weep, or even complain much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You slept a bit later this morning, little one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered, with fretful weariness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it's nearly eight o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) stood looking out of the window. The whole country was bleak and
pallid under the snow. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pulse. There was a strong stroke
and a weak one, like a sound and its echo. That was supposed to betoken
the end. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) feel her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wrist, knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) wanted.

<p/>Sometimes they looked in each other's eyes. Then they almost seemed to
make an agreement. It was almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) were agreeing to die also.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not consent to die; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) body was wasted to a
fragment of ash. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes were dark and full of torture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) something to put an end to it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) asked the doctor
at last.

<p/>But the doctor shook his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can't last many days now, Mr. Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said.

<p/>Paul went indoors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear it much longer; we shall all go mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/>The two sat down to breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) while we have breakfast, Minnie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie. But
the girl was frightened.

<p/>Paul went through the country, through the woods, over the snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw
the marks of rabbits and birds in the white snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wandered miles
and miles. A smoky red sunset came on slowly, painfully, lingering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would die that day. There was a donkey that came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
over the snow by the wood's edge, and put its head against him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and
walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) alongside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arms round the donkey's neck, and
stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cheeks against his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ears.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, silent, was still alive, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hard mouth gripped grimly,
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes of dark torture only living.

<p/>It was nearing Christmas; there was more snow. Annie and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt as if
they could go on no more. Still her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) dark eyes were alive. Morel, silent
and frightened, obliterated himself. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would go into the
sick-room and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) backed out, bewildered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) hold on life still. The miners had been out on strike, and
returned a fortnight or so before Christmas. Minnie went upstairs with
the feeding-cup. It was two days after the men had been in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have the men been saying their hands are sore, Minnie?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) asked,
in the faint, querulous voice that would not give in. Minnie stood
surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as I know of, Mrs. Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll bet they are sore,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the dying woman, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>)
head with a sigh of weariness. <div class="bookquote">``But, at any rate, there'll be something
to buy in with this week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Not a thing did she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) let slip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father's pit things will want well airing, Annie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) said, when
the men were going back to work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you bother about that, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/>One night Annie and Paul were alone. Nurse was upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'ll live over Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie. They were both full of horror.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied grimly. <div class="bookquote">``I s'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) morphia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All that came from Sheffield,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay--do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was painting in the bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) seemed to be asleep.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stepped softly backwards and forwards at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) painting. Suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
small voice wailed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't walk about, Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked round. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) eyes, like dark bubbles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) face, were looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said gently. Another fibre seemed to snap in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
heart.

<p/>That evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got all the morphia pills there were, and took them
downstairs. Carefully he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) crushed them to powder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll put 'em in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) night milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they both laughed together like two conspiring children. On top of
all their horror flicked this little sanity.

<p/>Nurse did not come that night to settle Mrs. Morel down. Paul went up
with the hot milk in a feeding-cup. It was nine o'clock.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was reared up in bed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put the feeding-cup between her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lips
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have died to save from any hurt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) took a sip, then put
the spout of the cup away and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dark, wondering
eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it IS bitter, Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, making a little grimace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a new sleeping draught the doctor gave me for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
thought it would leave you in such a state in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope it won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, like a child.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) drank some more of the milk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it IS horrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) frail fingers over the cup, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) lips making a little move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know--I tasted it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I'll give you some clean milk
afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went on with the draught. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was
obedient to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) like a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
poor wasted throat moving as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) drank with difficulty. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ran
downstairs for more milk. There were no grains in the bottom of the cup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) had it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>whispered Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said it was bitter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>laughed Annie, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) under lip between her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) it was a new draught. Where's that milk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both went upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder why nurse didn't come to settle me down?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>complained the
mother, like a child, wistfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was going to a concert, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>replied Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were silent a minute. Mrs. Morel gulped the little clean milk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annie, that draught WAS horrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said plaintively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it, my love? Well, never mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother sighed again with weariness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) pulse was very irregular.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let US settle you down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps nurse will be so late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother--<div class="bookquote">``try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>They turned the clothes back. Paul saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother like a girl curled up
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flannel nightdress. Quickly they made one half of the bed, moved
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), made the other, straightened her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nightgown over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) small feet, and
covered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) softly. <div class="bookquote">``There!--now you'll sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't think you could do the bed so nicely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
added, almost gaily. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) curled up, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheek on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
head snugged between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders. Paul put the long thin plait of grey
hair over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll sleep, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered trustfully. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They put out the light, and it was still.

<p/>Morel was in bed. Nurse did not come. Annie and Paul came to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
at about eleven. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) seemed to be sleeping as usual after her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) draught.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mouth had come a bit open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we sit up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'll lie with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) as I always do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) might wake up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. And call me if you see any difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They lingered before the bedroom fire, feeling the night big and black
and snowy outside, their two selves alone in the world. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went
into the next room and went to bed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) slept almost immediately, but kept waking every now and again. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went sound asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) started awake at Annie's whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Paul,
Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sister in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) white nightdress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) long plait of
hair down her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) back, standing in the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whispered, sitting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) slipped out of bed. A bud of gas was burning in the sick chamber.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cheek on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, curled up as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had gone
to sleep. But her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth had fallen open, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breathed with great,
hoarse breaths, like snoring, and there were long intervals between.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'s going!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long has she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) been like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only just woke up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>Annie huddled into the dressing-gown, Paul wrapped himself in a brown
blanket. It was three o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mended the fire. Then the two sat
waiting. The great, snoring breath was taken--held awhile--then given
back. There was a space--a long space. Then they started. The great,
snoring breath was taken again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bent close down and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it awful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>whispered Annie.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nodded. They sat down again helplessly. Again came the great, snoring
breath. Again they hung suspended. Again it was given back, long and
harsh. The sound, so irregular, at such wide intervals, sounded through
the house. Morel, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) room, slept on. Paul and Annie sat crouched,
huddled, motionless. The great snoring sound began again--there was a
painful pause while the breath was held--back came the rasping breath.
Minute after minute passed. Paul looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) again, bending low over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) may last like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>They were both silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked out of the window, and could faintly
discern the snow on the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You go to my bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to Annie. <div class="bookquote">``I'll sit up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll stop with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather you didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>At last Annie crept out of the room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hugged himself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brown blanket, crouched in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, watching. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
looked dreadful, with the bottom jaw fallen back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched. Sometimes
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought the great breath would never begin again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not bear
it--the waiting. Then suddenly, startling him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), came the great harsh
sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mended the fire again, noiselessly. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must not be disturbed.
The minutes went by. The night was going, breath by breath. Each time
the sound came he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt it wring him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), till at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not feel so
much.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father got up. Paul heard the miner drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stockings on,
yawning. Then Morel, in shirt and stockings, entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Morel stood watching. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) son, helplessly, and in
horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had I better stop a-whoam?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Go to work. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'ll last through to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Go to work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The miner</b></font>)</div><p/>The miner looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again, in fear, and went obediently out of the
room. Paul saw the tape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) garters swinging against his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) legs.

<p/>After another half-hour Paul went downstairs and drank a cup of tea,
then returned. Morel, dressed for the pit, came upstairs again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>And in a few minutes Paul heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father's heavy steps go thudding
over the deadening snow. Miners called in the streets as they
tramped in gangs to work. The terrible, long-drawn breaths
continued--heave--heave--heave; then a long pause--then--ah-h-h-h-h!
as it came back. Far away over the snow sounded the hooters of the
ironworks. One after another they crowed and boomed, some small and far
away, some near, the blowers of the collieries and the other works.
Then there was silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mended the fire. The great breaths broke the
silence--she (<font color='blue'><b>gangs</b></font>) looked just the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put back the blind and peered out.
Still it was dark. Perhaps there was a lighter tinge. Perhaps the snow
was bluer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) drew up the blind and got dressed. Then, shuddering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
drank brandy from the bottle on the wash-stand. The snow WAS growing
blue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard a cart clanking down the street. Yes, it was seven
o'clock, and it was coming a little bit light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard some people
calling. The world was waking. A grey, deathly dawn crept over the snow.
Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could see the houses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) put out the gas. It seemed very dark.
The breathing came still, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was almost used to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was just the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) piled heavy clothes on top
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) it would stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). That was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)--not her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a bit.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) piled the blanket and heavy coats on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)--

<p/>Suddenly the door opened, and Annie entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
questioningly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said calmly.

<p/>They whispered together a minute, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went downstairs to get
breakfast. It was twenty to eight. Soon Annie came down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it awful! Doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) look awful!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) whispered, dazed with
horror.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) looks like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink some tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>They went upstairs again. Soon the neighbours came with their frightened
question:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the neighbours</b></font>)</div><p/>It went on just the same. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) cheek in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mouth
fallen open, and the great, ghastly snores came and went.

<p/>At ten o'clock nurse came. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) looked strange and woebegone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nurse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>cried Paul, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>)'ll last like this for days?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) can't, Mr. Morel,''  (<font color='red'><b>nurse</b></font>)</div>said nurse. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>wailed the nurse. <div class="bookquote">``Who would have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) could
stand it? Go down now, Mr. Morel, go down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At last, at about eleven o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went downstairs and sat in the
neighbour's house. Annie was downstairs also. Nurse and Arthur were
upstairs. Paul sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand. Suddenly Annie came flying
across the yard crying, half mad:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul--Paul--she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>)'s gone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>In a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own house and upstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) lay curled
up and still, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) face on her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) hand, and nurse was wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) mouth.
They all stood back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kneeled down, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face to hers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love--my love--oh, my love!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whispered again and again. <div class="bookquote">``My
love--oh, my love!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard the nurse behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), crying, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>)'s better, Mr. Morel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>)'s better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) warm, dead mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went straight
downstairs and began blacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) boots.

<p/>There was a good deal to do, letters to write, and so on. The doctor
came and glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay--poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, then turned away. <div class="bookquote">``Well, call at the surgery
about six for the certificate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/>The father came home from work at about four o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dragged
silently into the house and sat down. Minnie bustled to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
dinner. Tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) black arms on the table. There were swede
turnips for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dinner, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) liked. Paul wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew. It was
some time, and nobody had spoken. At last the son said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You noticed the blinds were down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div><p/>Morel looked up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why--has she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When wor that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About twelve this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The miner</b></font>)</div><p/>The miner sat still for a moment, then began his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) dinner. It was as
if nothing had happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) turnips in silence. Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
washed and went upstairs to dress. The door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) room was shut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Annie asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>In a little while he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went out. Annie went away, and Paul called on the
undertaker, the clergyman, the doctor, the registrar. It was a long
business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got back at nearly eight o'clock. The undertaker was coming
soon to measure for the coffin. The house was empty except for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>)
took a candle and went upstairs.

<p/>The room was cold, that had been warm for so long. Flowers, bottles,
plates, all sick-room litter was taken away; everything was harsh and
austere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) lay raised on the bed, the sweep of the sheet from the
raised feet was like a clean curve of snow, so silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) lay like a
maiden asleep. With his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) lay
like a girl asleep and dreaming of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) love. The mouth was a little open
as if wondering from the suffering, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) face was young, her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) brow
clear and white as if life had never touched it. He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) looked again at the
eyebrows, at the small, winsome nose a bit on one side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was young
again. Only the hair as it arched so beautifully from her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) temples was
mixed with silver, and the two simple plaits that lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) shoulders
were filigree of silver and brown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would wake up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)
eyelids. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was with him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) still. He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) bent and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) passionately.
But there was coldness against his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) lips with horror.
Looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) could never, never let her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) go. No! He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) stroked
the hair from her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) temples. That, too, was cold. He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) saw the mouth so dumb
and wondering at the hurt. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) crouched on the floor, whispering to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) was still with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) when the undertakers came, young men who had
been to school with him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>). They touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) reverently, and in a quiet,
businesslike fashion. They did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) watched jealously. He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>)
and Annie guarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) fiercely. They would not let anybody come to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), and the neighbours were offended.

<p/>After a while Paul went out of the house, and played cards at a
friend's. It was midnight when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got back. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father rose from the
couch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) entered, saying in a plaintive way:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought tha wor niver comin', lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't think you'd sit up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father looked so forlorn. Morel had been a man without fear--simply
nothing frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Paul realised with a start that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been
afraid to go to bed, alone in the house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was sorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot you'd be alone, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dost want owt to eat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sithee--I made thee a drop o' hot milk. Get it down thee; it's cold
enough for owt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul drank it.

<p/>After a while Morel went to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hurried past the closed door, and
left his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own door open. Soon the son came upstairs also. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went in to
kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) good-night, as usual. It was cold and dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) wished they had
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fire burning. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dreamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) young dream. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would
be cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``My dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) did not kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) should be cold and strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>).
It eased him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) slept so beautifully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) door softly, not to
wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and went to bed.

<p/>In the morning Morel summoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) courage, hearing Annie downstairs and
Paul coughing in the room across the landing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) door, and
went into the darkened room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw the white uplifted form in the
twilight, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dared not see. Bewildered, too frightened to
possess any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) faculties, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got out of the room again and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) never looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) for months, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had not dared to look. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) looked like his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) young wife again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Annie asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sharply after breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) looks nice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went out of the house soon after. And all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed to be
creeping aside to avoid it.

<p/>Paul went about from place to place, doing the business of the death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
met Clara in Nottingham, and they had tea together in a cafe, when they
were quite jolly again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was infinitely relieved to find he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not
take it tragically.

<p/>Later, when the relatives began to come for the funeral, the affair
became public, and the children became social beings. They put
themselves aside. They buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in a furious storm of rain and wind.
The wet clay glistened, all the white flowers were soaked. Annie
gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arm and leaned forward. Down below she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) saw a dark corner
of William's coffin. The oak box sank steadily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was gone. The
rain poured in the grave. The procession of black, with its umbrellas
glistening, turned away. The cemetery was deserted under the drenching
cold rain.

<p/>Paul went home and busied himself supplying the guests with drinks.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father sat in the kitchen with Mrs. Morel's relatives, <div class="bookquote">``superior''
 (<font color='red'><b>Morel relatives</b></font>)</div>people, and wept, and said what a good lass she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)'d been, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'d
tried to do everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)--everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had striven
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'d nothing to reproach
himself with. She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) was gone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'d done his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) best for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) white handkerchief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'d nothing to reproach himself for,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) repeated. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'d done his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) best for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>).

<p/>And that was how he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tried to dismiss her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) never thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)
personally. Everything deep in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) denied. Paul hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father
for sitting sentimentalising over her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would do it in
the public-houses. For the real tragedy went on in Morel in spite of
himself. Sometimes, later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) came down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) afternoon sleep, white
and cowering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I HAVE been dreaming of thy mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said in a small voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you, father? When I dream of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) it's always just as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was when
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was well. I dream of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) often, but it seems quite nice and natural,
as if nothing had altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>But Morel crouched in front of the fire in terror.

<p/>The weeks passed half-real, not much pain, not much of anything, perhaps
a little relief, mostly a _nuit blanche_. Paul went restless from place
to place. For some months, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother had been worse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had not
made love to Clara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was, as it were, dumb to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), rather distant.
Dawes saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) very occasionally, but the two could not get an inch
across the great distance between them. The three of them were drifting
forward.

<p/>Dawes mended very slowly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was in the convalescent home at Skegness at
Christmas, nearly well again. Paul went to the seaside for a few days.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father was with Annie in Sheffield. Dawes came to Paul's lodgings.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) time in the home was up. The two men, between whom was such a big
reserve, seemed faithful to each other. Dawes depended on Morel now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>)
knew Paul and Clara had practically separated.

<p/>Two days after Christmas Paul was to go back to Nottingham. The evening
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat with Dawes smoking before the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Clara's coming down for the day to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>The other man glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) replied.

<p/>Paul drank the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) glass of whisky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told the landlady your wife was coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, shrinking, but almost leaving himself in the
other's hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) got up rather stiffly, and reached for Morel's glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me fill you up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/>Paul jumped up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You sit still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>But Dawes, with rather shaky hand, continued to mix the drink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say when,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other. <div class="bookquote">``But you've no business to get up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does me good, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Dawes. <div class="bookquote">``I begin to think I'm right
again, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are about right, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, certainly I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, nodding to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Len says he (<font color='blue'><b>Len</b></font>) can get you on in Sheffield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) again, with dark eyes that agreed with everything
the other would say, perhaps a trifle dominated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``starting again. I feel in a lot bigger mess
than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way, lad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I don't know. It's as if I was in a tangled sort of hole,
rather dark and dreary, and no road anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know--I understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>Dawes said, nodding. <div class="bookquote">``But you'll find it'll
come all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spoke caressingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Dawes knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pipe in a hopeless fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not done for yourself like I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>Morel saw the wrist and the white hand of the other man gripping the
stem of the pipe and knocking out the ash, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) had given up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How old are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Paul asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>replied Dawes, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>Those brown eyes, full of the consciousness of failure, almost pleading
for reassurance, for someone to re-establish the man in himself, to warm
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), to set him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up firm again, troubled Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll just be in your prime,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``You don't look as if much
life had gone out of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The brown eyes of the other flashed suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It hasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The go is there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul looked up and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've both got plenty of life in us yet to make things fly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>The eyes of the two men met. They exchanged one look. Having recognised
the stress of passion each in the other, they both drank their whisky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, begod!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, breathless.

<p/>There was a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``why you shouldn't go on where you left
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, suggestively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--fit your old home together again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, and looked up with an ironic smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Because you don't want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They smoked in silence. Dawes showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) teeth as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pipe stem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean you don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/>Dawes stared up at the picture with a caustic expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/>The smoke floated softly up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wants you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other, soft, satirical, abstract.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never really hitched on to me--you were always there in the
background. That's why she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wouldn't get a divorce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes continued to stare in a satirical fashion at the picture over the
mantelpiece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's how women are with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul. <div class="bookquote">``They want me like mad, but
they don't want to belong to me. And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) BELONGED to you all the time. I
knew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The male</b></font>)</div><p/>The triumphant male came up in Dawes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) teeth more
distinctly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I was a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were a big fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps even THEN you were a bigger fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/>There was a touch of triumph and malice in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>They were silent for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, I'm clearing out to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>answered Dawes.

<p/>Then they did not talk any more. The instinct to murder each other had
returned. They almost avoided each other.

<p/>They shared the same bedroom. When they retired Dawes seemed abstract,
thinking of something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sat on the side of the bed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shirt,
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you getting cold?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>asked Morel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was lookin' at these legs,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's up with 'em? They look all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>replied Paul, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They look all right. But there's some water in 'em yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul reluctantly got out of bed and went to look at the rather handsome
legs of the other man that were covered with glistening, dark gold hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shin. <div class="bookquote">``Look at the water under
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>The man pressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) finger-tips. They left little dents that filled
up slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/>Paul tried with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fingers. It made little dents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rotten, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? It's nothing much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not much of a man with water in your legs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see as it makes any difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I've got a weak
chest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) own bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose the rest of me's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) put out the
light.

<p/>In the morning it was raining. Morel packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) bag. The sea was grey
and shaggy and dismal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) seemed to be cutting himself off from life
more and more. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) a wicked pleasure to do it.

<p/>The two men were at the station. Clara stepped out of the train, and
came along the platform, very erect and coldly composed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wore a long
coat and a tweed hat. Both men hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) composure. Paul shook
hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) at the barrier. Dawes was leaning against the bookstall,
watching. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) black overcoat was buttoned up to the chin because of the
rain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was pale, with almost a touch of nobility in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) quietness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
came forward, limping slightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to look better than this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm all right now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The three stood at a loss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) kept the two men hesitating near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go to the lodging straight off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``or somewhere
else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We may as well go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/>Paul walked on the outside of the pavement, then Dawes, then Clara. They
made polite conversation. The sitting-room faced the sea, whose tide,
grey and shaggy, hissed not far off.

<p/>Morel swung up the big arm-chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want that chair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>Morel repeated.

<p/>Clara took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) things and laid them on the couch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had a slight
air of resentment. Lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) hair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) fingers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) sat down,
rather aloof and composed. Paul ran downstairs to speak to the landlady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you're cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Come nearer to
the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I'm quite warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) looked out of the window at the rain and at the sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When are you going back?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the rooms are taken until to-morrow, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wants me to stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s
going back to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you're thinking of going to Sheffield?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you fit to start work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to start.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've really got a place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--begin on Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't look fit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) looked again out of the window instead of answering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you got lodgings in Sheffield?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) looked away out of the window. The panes were blurred with
streaming rain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And can you manage all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s'd think so. I s'll have to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/>They were silent when Morel returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go by the four-twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) entered.

<p/>Nobody answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd take your boots off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said to Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a pair of slippers of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They aren't wet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) put the slippers near her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) left them there.

<p/>Morel sat down. Both the men seemed helpless, and each of them had a
rather hunted look. But Dawes now carried himself quietly, seemed to
yield himself, while Paul seemed to screw himself up. Clara thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) look so small and mean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was as if trying to
get himself into the smallest possible compass. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went about
arranging, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat talking, there seemed something false about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
and out of tune. Watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) unknown, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said to herself there was
no stability about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was fine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) way, passionate, and able to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) drinks of pure life when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was in one mood. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked
paltry and insignificant. There was nothing stable about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
husband had more manly dignity. At any rate HE (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not waft about with
any wind. There was something evanescent about Morel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) thought,
something shifting and false. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would never make sure ground for any
woman to stand on. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rather for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shrinking together,
getting smaller. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband at least was manly, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was beaten
gave in. But this other would never own to being beaten. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) would shift
round and round, prowl, get smaller. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) rather than Dawes, and it seemed as if their three fates lay
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) for it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) seemed to understand better now about men, and what they could or
would do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was less afraid of them, more sure of herself. That
they were not the small egoists she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had imagined them made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) more
comfortable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had learned a good deal--almost as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) wanted
to learn. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) cup had been full. It was still as full as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) could
carry. On the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) would not be sorry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>They had dinner, and sat eating nuts and drinking by the fire. Not
a serious word had been spoken. Yet Clara realised that Morel was
withdrawing from the circle, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) the option to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
husband. It angered her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a mean fellow, after all, to take what
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted and then give her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did not remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) herself
had had what she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted, and really, at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) heart, wished
to be given back.

<p/>Paul felt crumpled up and lonely. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother had really supported his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); they two had, in fact, faced the world together.
Now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gone, and for ever behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was the gap in life, the tear
in the veil, through which his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life seemed to drift slowly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
were drawn towards death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted someone of their own free initiative
to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The lesser things he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) began to let go from him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), for fear of
this big thing, the lapse towards death, following in the wake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
beloved. Clara could not stand for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to hold on to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
but not to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted the man on top, not the
real him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that was in trouble. That would be too much trouble to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
dared not give it her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not cope with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ashamed.
So, secretly ashamed because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was in such a mess, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own hold
on life was so unsure, because nobody held him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), feeling unsubstantial,
shadowy, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not count for much in this concrete world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) drew
himself together smaller and smaller. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not want to die; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would
not give in. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was not afraid of death. If nobody would help, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
would go on alone.

<p/>Dawes had been driven to the extremity of life, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
could go to the brink of death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could lie on the edge and look in.
Then, cowed, afraid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to crawl back, and like a beggar take what
offered. There was a certain nobility in it. As Clara saw, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) owned
himself beaten, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wanted to be taken back whether or not. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
could do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). It was three o'clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going by the four-twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Paul again to Clara. <div class="bookquote">``Are you
coming then or later?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm meeting my father in Nottingham at seven-fifteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'll come later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dawes jerked suddenly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been held on a strain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked out
over the sea, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are one or two books in the corner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>said Morel. <div class="bookquote">``I've done with
'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At about four o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see you both later,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) shook hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes. <div class="bookquote">``An' perhaps--one day--I s'll be able to pay
you back the money as--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come for it, you'll see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Morel/Paul Morel</b></font>)</div>laughed Paul. <div class="bookquote">``I s'll be on the rocks
before I'm very much older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay--well--''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Dawes/Clara Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) hand. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for
the last time, dumb and humble.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was gone. Dawes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife sat down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a nasty day for travelling,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered.

<p/>They talked in a desultory fashion until it grew dark. The landlady
brought in the tea. Dawes drew up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair to the table without being
invited, like a husband. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat humbly waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cup. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
served him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) would, like a wife, not consulting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wish.

<p/>After tea, as it drew near to six o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to the window. All
was dark outside. The sea was roaring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's raining yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't go to-night, shall you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, hesitating.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't go in this rain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you WANT me to stay?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) asked.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held the dark curtain trembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) rose and went slowly to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
let go the curtain, turned, hesitating, towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) stood with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) back, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a heavy, inscrutable
fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me, Baxter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) asked.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was hoarse as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to come back to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) made a moaning noise, lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) arms, and put them round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
neck, drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) shoulder, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
clasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take me back!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) whispered, ecstatic. <div class="bookquote">``Take me back, take me back!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) fingers through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fine, thin dark hair, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) were
only semi-conscious. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tightened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grasp on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me again?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murmured, broken.



<p/>CHAPTER XV

<p/>DERELICT

<p/>CLARA went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) husband to Sheffield, and Paul scarcely saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
again. Walter Morel seemed to have let all the trouble go over him (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>), and
there he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) was, crawling about on the mud of it, just the same. There was
scarcely any bond between father and son, save that each felt he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) must
not let the other go in any actual want. As there was no one to keep on
the home, and as they could neither of them bear the emptiness of the
house, Paul took lodgings in Nottingham, and Morel went to live with a
friendly family in Bestwood.

<p/>Everything seemed to have gone smash for the young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
paint. The picture he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finished on the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's death--one
that satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--was the last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did. At work there was no
Clara. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came home he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not take up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brushes again. There
was nothing left.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always in the town at one place or another, drinking,
knocking about with the men he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew. It really wearied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked to
barmaids, to almost any woman, but there was that dark, strained look in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were hunting something.

<p/>Everything seemed so different, so unreal. There seemed no reason why
people should go along the street, and houses pile up in the daylight.
There seemed no reason why these things should occupy the space, instead
of leaving it empty. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the sounds, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. But why there should be the noise of speech he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
understand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was most himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was alone, or working hard and mechanically
at the factory. In the latter case there was pure forgetfulness, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lapsed from consciousness. But it had to come to an end. It hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so,
that things had lost their reality. The first snowdrops came. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the
tiny drop-pearls among the grey. They would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the liveliest
emotion at one time. Now they were there, but they did not seem to mean
anything. In a few moments they would cease to occupy that place, and
just the space would be, where they had been. Tall, brilliant tram-cars
ran along the street at night. It seemed almost a wonder they should
trouble to rustle backwards and forwards. <div class="bookquote">``Why trouble to go tilting
down to Trent Bridges?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked of the big trams. It seemed they just
as well might NOT be as be.

<p/>The realest thing was the thick darkness at night. That seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
whole and comprehensible and restful. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could leave himself to it.
Suddenly a piece of paper started near his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet and blew along down the
pavement. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood still, rigid, with clenched fists, a flame of agony
going over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw again the sick-room, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes.
Unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) company. The swift hop of
the paper reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gone. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted
everything to stand still, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again.

<p/>The days passed, the weeks. But everything seemed to have fused, gone
into a conglomerated mass. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not tell one day from another, one
week from another, hardly one place from another. Nothing was distinct
or distinguishable. Often he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost himself for an hour at a time, could
not remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done.

<p/>One evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came home late to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodging. The fire was burning low;
everybody was in bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw on some more coal, glanced at the table,
and decided he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted no supper. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down in the arm-chair. It
was perfectly still. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know anything, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the dim
smoke wavering up the chimney. Presently two mice came out, cautiously,
nibbling the fallen crumbs. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched them as it were from a long
way off. The church clock struck two. Far away he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the sharp
clinking of the trucks on the railway. No, it was not they that were far
away. They were there in their places. But where was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself?

<p/>The time passed. The two mice, careering wildly, scampered cheekily over
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slippers. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not moved a muscle. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not want to move. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was not thinking of anything. It was easier so. There was no wrench of
knowing anything. Then, from time to time, some other consciousness,
working mechanically, flashed into sharp phrases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And out of the semi-intoxicated trance came the answer:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Destroying myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then a dull, live feeling, gone in an instant, told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that it was
wrong. After a while, suddenly came the question:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again there was no answer, but a stroke of hot stubbornness inside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
chest resisted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own annihilation.

<p/>There was a sound of a heavy cart clanking down the road. Suddenly
the electric light went out; there was a bruising thud in the
penny-in-the-slot meter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not stir, but sat gazing in front of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Only the mice had scuttled, and the fire glowed red in the dark
room.

<p/>Then, quite mechanically and more distinctly, the conversation began
again inside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s dead. What was it all for--her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) struggle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>That was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) despair wanting to go after her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is--in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt tired with the burden of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to keep alive for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Something felt sulky, as if it would not rouse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to carry forward her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) living, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had done, go on
with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not want to. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to give up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can go on with your painting,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the will in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Or else
you can beget children. They both carry on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) effort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Painting is not living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the sulky question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As best you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miriam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not trust that.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose suddenly, went straight to bed. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got inside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bedroom
and closed the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood with clenched fist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mater, my dear--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began, with the whole force of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not say it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to die,
to have done. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not own that life had beaten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or that death
had beaten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Going straight to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slept at once, abandoning
himself to the sleep.

<p/>So the weeks went on. Always alone, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul oscillated, first on the
side of death, then on the side of life, doggedly. The real agony
was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nowhere to go, nothing to do, nothing to say, and WAS
nothing himself. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran down the streets as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were mad:
sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was mad; things weren't there, things were there. It made
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pant. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood before the bar of the public-house where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
called for a drink. Everything suddenly stood back away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
saw the face of the barmaid, the gobbling drinkers, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own glass on the
slopped, mahogany board, in the distance. There was something between
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not get into touch. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not want them; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not want his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drink. Turning abruptly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out. On the threshold he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stood and looked at the lighted street. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not of it or in it.
Something separated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Everything went on there below those lamps,
shut away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not get at them. He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) couldn't touch
the lamp-posts, not if he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) reached. Where could he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) go? There was nowhere
to go, neither back into the inn, or forward anywhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) felt stifled.
There was nowhere for him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>). The stress grew inside him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) should
smash.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mustn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) said; and, turning blindly, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) went in and drank.
Sometimes the drink did him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) good; sometimes it made him (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) ran
down the road. For ever restless, he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) went here, there, everywhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
determined to work. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) had made six strokes, he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) loathed the
pencil violently, got up, and went away, hurried off to a club where he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
could play cards or billiards, to a place where he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) could flirt with a
barmaid who was no more to him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) than the brass pump-handle she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) drew.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) was very thin and lantern-jawed. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) dared not meet his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) own eyes
in the mirror; he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) never looked at himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) wanted to get away from
himself, but there was nothing to get hold of. In despair he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) thought of
Miriam. Perhaps--perhaps--?

<p/>Then, happening to go into the Unitarian Church one Sunday evening, when
they stood up to sing the second hymn he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) before him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>). The light
glistened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) lower lip as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) had got
something, at any rate: some hope in heaven, if not in earth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
comfort and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) life seemed in the after-world. A warm, strong feeling
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) came up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed to yearn, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sang, for the mystery and
comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) hope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) longed for the sermon to be over, to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>The throng carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) out just before him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) could nearly touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not know he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was there. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) saw the brown, humble nape of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) neck
under its black curls. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) would leave himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was better and
bigger than he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) would depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went wandering, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) blind way, through the little throngs of
people outside the church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) always looked so lost and out of place
among people. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) went forward and put his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) started
violently. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) great brown eyes dilated in fear, then went questioning
at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) shrank slightly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) looked away. His (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sudden, flaring hope sank again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing in town?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm staying at Cousin Anne's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! For long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; only till to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must you go straight home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), then hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face under her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hat-brim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``no; it's not necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) turned away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) went with him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). They threaded through the throng
of church people. The organ was still sounding in St. Mary's. Dark
figures came through the lighted doors; people were coming down the
steps. The large coloured windows glowed up in the night. The church was
like a great lantern suspended. They went down Hollow Stone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) took
the car for the Bridges.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will just have supper with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``then I'll bring you
back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) replied, low and husky.

<p/>They scarcely spoke while they were on the car. The Trent ran dark and
full under the bridge. Away towards Colwick all was black night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>)
lived down Holme Road, on the naked edge of the town, facing across the
river meadows towards Sneinton Hermitage and the steep scrap of Colwick
Wood. The floods were out. The silent water and the darkness spread away
on their left. Almost afraid, they hurried along by the houses.

<p/>Supper was laid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) swung the curtain over the window. There was a bowl
of freesias and scarlet anemones on the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) bent to them. Still
touching them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) finger-tips, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>), saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't they beautiful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What will you drink--coffee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then excuse me a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) went out to the kitchen.

<p/>Miriam took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) things and looked round. It was a bare, severe
room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) photo, Clara's, Annie's, were on the wall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked on
the drawing-board to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) was doing. There were only a few
meaningless lines. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked to see what books he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) was reading.
Evidently just an ordinary novel. The letters in the rack she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw
were from Annie, Arthur, and from some man or other she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) did not know.
Everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had touched, everything that was in the least personal to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) examined with lingering absorption. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been gone from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
for so long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) wanted to rediscover him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) position, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was
now. But there was not much in the room to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). It only made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
feel rather sad, it was so hard and comfortless.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was curiously examining a sketch-book when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) returned with the
coffee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing new in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and nothing very interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) put down the tray, and went to look over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) turned the
pages slowly, intent on examining everything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) paused at a sketch. <div class="bookquote">``I'd forgotten that. It's not
bad, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) took the book from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) and went through it. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made a curious
sound of surprise and pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some not bad stuff in there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) answered gravely.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt again her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) work. Or was it for himself? Why was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) always most interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) work?

<p/>They sat down to supper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``didn't I hear something about your earning your
own living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) replied, bowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cup. <div class="bookquote">``And what of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm merely going to the farming college at Broughton for three months,
and I shall probably be kept on as a teacher there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say--that sounds all right for you! You always wanted to be
independent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only knew last week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I heard a month ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but nothing was settled then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you'd have told me you were trying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) food in the deliberate, constrained way, almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
recoiled a little from doing anything so publicly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knew so well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you're glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--it will be something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was rather disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it will be a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, almost haughtily,
resentfully.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) laughed shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you think it won't?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't think it won't be a great deal. Only you'll find earning
your own living isn't everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, swallowing with difficulty; <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose work CAN be nearly everything to a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``though it
isn't to me. But a woman only works with a part of herself. The real and
vital part is covered up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But a man can give ALL himself to work?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, practically.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a woman only the unimportant part of herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) eyes dilated with anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if it's true, it's a great shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is. But I don't know everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) answered.

<p/>After supper they drew up to the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) swung her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) a chair facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>),
and they sat down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was wearing a dress of dark claret colour, that
suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) dark complexion and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) large features. Still, the curls
were fine and free, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face was much older, the brown throat much
thinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) seemed old to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), older than Clara. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bloom of youth had
quickly gone. A sort of stiffness, almost of woodenness, had come upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) meditated a little while, then looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how are things with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), waiting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, very low.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) brown, nervous hands were clasped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knee. They had still the
lack of confidence or repose, the almost hysterical look. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) winced as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw them. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) laughed mirthlessly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fingers between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) slim, black, tortured body lay quite still in the chair.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) suddenly took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) finger from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mouth and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have broken off with Clara?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) body lay like an abandoned thing, strewn in the chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I think we ought to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes for the first time since many months, and attended to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with respect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how you waste yourself! You might be ill, you might
die, and I never know--be no more then than if I had never known you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if we married?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, I could prevent you wasting yourself and being a prey to
other women--like--like Clara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A prey?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) repeated, smiling.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head in silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lay feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) despair come up again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said slowly, <div class="bookquote">``that marriage would be much good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only think of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you do. But--you love me so much, you want to put me in your
pocket. And I should die there smothered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fingers between her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lips, while the
bitterness surged up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will you do otherwise?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--go on, I suppose. Perhaps I shall soon go abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The despairing doggedness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tone made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) go on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knees on the
rug before the fire, very near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). There she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) crouched as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) were
crushed by something, and could not raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands lay quite
inert on the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was aware of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt that
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mercy. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could rise, take him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms round
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and say, <div class="bookquote">``You are mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would leave himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
But dare she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could easily sacrifice herself. But dare she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) assert
herself? She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dark-clothed, slender body, that seemed
one stroke of life, sprawled in the chair close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). But no; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
dared not put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms round it, take it up, and say, <div class="bookquote">``It is mine, this
body. Leave it to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted to. It called to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) woman's
instinct. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) crouched, and dared not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would
not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was afraid it was too much. It lay there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) body,
abandoned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ought to take it up and claim it, and claim
every right to it. But--could she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) do it? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) impotence before him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>),
before the strong demand of some unknown thing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), was her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
extremity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hands fluttered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) half-lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes,
shuddering, appealing, gone, almost distracted, pleaded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) suddenly.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) heart caught with pity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hands, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and
comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you have me, to marry me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said very low.

<p/>Oh, why did not he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) very soul belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Why would he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
not take what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had borne so long the cruelty of belonging to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and not being claimed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) again. It
was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) drew back her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head, held his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) face between her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
hands, and looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in the eyes. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wanted something
else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) pleaded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) love not to make it her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) choice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not cope with it, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) knew not with what. But it
strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would break.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) asked, very gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) replied, with pain.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face aside; then, raising herself with dignity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) bosom, and rocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) softly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was not to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>),
then! So she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) fingers through his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hair.
For her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), the anguished sweetness of self-sacrifice. For him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), the hate
and misery of another failure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could not bear it--that breast which
was warm and which cradled him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) without taking the burden of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). So much
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wanted to rest on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) that the feint of rest only tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
drew away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And without marriage we can do nothing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) asked.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mouth was lifted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) teeth with pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) little finger
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, low and like the toll of a bell. <div class="bookquote">``No, I think not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the end then between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not take him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
of the responsibility of himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could only sacrifice herself to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)--sacrifice herself every day, gladly. And that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did not want. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and say, with joy and authority: <div class="bookquote">``Stop all this
restlessness and beating against death. You are mine for a mate.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
had not the strength. Or was it a mate she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) wanted? or did she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) want a
Christ in him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) felt, in leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was defrauding her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) of life. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knew
that, in staying, stilling the inner, desperate man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was denying his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
own life. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) did not hope to give life to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) by denying his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sat very quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) lit a cigarette. The smoke went up from it,
wavering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mother, and had forgotten Miriam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)
suddenly looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bitterness came surging up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sacrifice,
then, was useless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) lay there aloof, careless about her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). Suddenly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) saw again his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) lack of religion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) restless instability. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would
destroy himself like a perverse child. Well, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) said softly.

<p/>By her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was despising him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) rose quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come along with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) answered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) stood before the mirror pinning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hat. How bitter, how
unutterably bitter, it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) rejected her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) sacrifice! Life
ahead looked dead, as if the glow were gone out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) face over
the flowers--the freesias so sweet and spring-like, the scarlet anemones
flaunting over the table. It was like him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) to have those flowers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) moved about the room with a certain sureness of touch, swift and
relentless and quiet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not cope with him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would
escape like a weasel out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) hands. Yet without him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) life would
trail on lifeless. Brooding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) touched the flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) took them out of the jar, dripping as they
were, and went quickly into the kitchen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), took the
flowers, and they went out together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) talking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) feeling dead.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) was going from him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) now. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) leaned against him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) as they
sat on the car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was unresponsive. Where would he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) go? What would
be the end of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) could not bear it, the vacant feeling where he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
should be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was so foolish, so wasteful, never at peace with himself.
And now where would he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) go? And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) wasted her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
had no religion; it was all for the moment's attraction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) cared,
nothing else, nothing deeper. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) would wait and see how it turned
out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had had enough he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would give in and come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) shook hands and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) cousin's house. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
turned away he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) felt the last hold for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had gone. The town, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) sat
upon the car, stretched away over the bay of railway, a level fume of
lights. Beyond the town the country, little smouldering spots for
more towns--the sea--the night--on and on! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had no place in it!
Whatever spot he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) stood on, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) stood alone. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) breast,
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mouth, sprang the endless space, and it was there behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>),
everywhere. The people hurrying along the streets offered no obstruction
to the void in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) found himself. They were small shadows whose
footsteps and voices could be heard, but in each of them the same night,
the same silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) got off the car. In the country all was dead
still. Little stars shone high up; little stars spread far away in the
flood-waters, a firmament below. Everywhere the vastness and terror of
the immense night which is roused and stirred for a brief while by
the day, but which returns, and will remain at last eternal, holding
everything in its silence and its living gloom. There was no Time, only
Space. Who could say his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mother had lived and did not live? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been
in one place, and was in another; that was all. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) soul could not
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gone abroad into the night, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still. They were together. But yet there was his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) body,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) chest, that leaned against the stile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hands on the wooden bar.
They seemed something. Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)?--one tiny upright speck of flesh,
less than an ear of wheat lost in the field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) could not bear it.
On every side the immense dark silence seemed pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), so tiny
a spark, into extinction, and yet, almost nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) could not be
extinct. Night, in which everything was lost, went reaching out, beyond
stars and sun. Stars and sun, a few bright grains, went spinning round
for terror, and holding each other in embrace, there in a darkness
that outpassed them all, and left them tiny and daunted. So much, and
himself, infinitesimal, at the core a nothingness, and yet not nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) whispered--<div class="bookquote">``mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was the only thing that held him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) up, himself, amid all this. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was gone, intermingled herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), have him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
alongside with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).

<p/>But no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would not give in. Turning sharply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) walked towards the
city's gold phosphorescence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) fists were shut, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mouth set fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
would not take that direction, to the darkness, to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) walked
towards the faintly humming, glowing town, quickly.
