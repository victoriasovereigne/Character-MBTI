<p/>ONCE there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. This story is
about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war
because of the air-raids. They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the
country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and two miles from the nearest post office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had
no wife and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called Mrs Macready and three
servants. -LRB-Their names were Ivy, Margaret and Betty, but they do not come into the story much.-RRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
himself was a very old man with shaggy white hair which grew over most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) face as well as on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
head, and they liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) almost at once; but on the first evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) came out to meet them at
the front door he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was so odd-looking that Lucy -LRB-who was the youngest-RRB- was a little afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), and
Edmund -LRB-who was the next youngest-RRB- wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was blowing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) nose to hide it.

<p/>As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the first night, the boys
came into the girls' room and they all talked it over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've fallen on our feet and no mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``This is going to be perfectly splendid. That
old chap will let us do anything we like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s an old dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come off it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, who was tired and pretending not to be tired, which always made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) bad-tempered. <div class="bookquote">``Don't go on talking like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan; <div class="bookquote">``and anyway, it's time you were in bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Trying to talk like Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``And who are you to say when I'm to go to bed? Go to
bed yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't we all better go to bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``There's sure to be a row if we're heard talking here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No there won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you this is the sort of house where no one's going to mind what
we do. Anyway, they won't hear us. It's about ten minutes' walk from here down to that dining-room,
and any amount of stairs and passages in between.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that noise?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had ever been in before
and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feel a little creepy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only a bird, silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an owl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``This is going to be a wonderful place for birds. I shall go to bed now. I
say, let's go and explore tomorrow. You might find anything in a place like this. Did you see those
mountains as we came along? And the woods? There might be eagles. There might be stags. There'll
be hawks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Badgers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Foxes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rabbits!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/>But when next morning came there was a steady rain falling, so thick that when you looked out of
the window you could see neither the mountains nor the woods nor even the stream in the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it would be raining!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund. They had just finished their breakfast with the
Professor and were upstairs in the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had set apart for them - a long, low room with two
windows looking out in one direction and two in another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do stop grumbling, Ed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``Ten to one it'll clear up in an hour or so. And in the
meantime we're pretty well off. There's a wireless and lots of books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for me''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter; <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to explore in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began. It was the sort of house that you
never seem to come to the end of, and it was full of unexpected places. The first few doors they tried
led only into spare bedrooms, as everyone had expected that they would; but soon they came to a
very long room full of pictures and there they found a suit of armour; and after that was a room all
hung with green, with a harp in one corner; and then came three steps down and five steps up, and
then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out on to a balcony, and then a whole series of
rooms that led into each other and were lined with books - most of them very old books and some
bigger than a Bible in a church. And shortly after that they looked into a room that was quite empty
except for one big wardrobe; the sort that has a looking-glass in the door. There was nothing else in
the room at all except a dead blue-bottle on the window-sill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, and they all trooped out again - all except Lucy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stayed behind
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought it would be worth while trying the door of the wardrobe, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt
almost sure that it would be locked. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) surprise it opened quite easily, and two moth-balls
dropped out.

<p/>Looking into the inside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw several coats hanging up - mostly long fur coats. There was nothing
Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got
in among the coats and rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face against them, leaving the door open, of course, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) went further in and found that
there was a second row of coats hanging up behind the first one. It was almost quite dark in there and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arms stretched out in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) so as not to bump her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face into the back of the
wardrobe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took a step further in - then two or three steps always expecting to feel woodwork
against the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fingers. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not feel it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>thought Lucy, going still further in and pushing the
soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) noticed that there was something
crunching under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder is that more mothballs?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought, stooping down to feel it
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hand. But instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt
something soft and powdery and extremely cold. <div class="bookquote">``This is very queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, and went on a step or
two further.

<p/>Next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found that what was rubbing against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face and hands was no longer soft fur but
something hard and rough and even prickly. <div class="bookquote">``Why, it is just like branches of trees!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucy.
And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw that there was a light ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); not a few inches away where the back of the
wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). A
moment later she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet and snowflakes falling through the air.

<p/>Lucy felt a little frightened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt very inquisitive and excited as well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked back over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shoulder and there, between the dark tree trunks; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could still see the open doorway of the
wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had set out. -LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had, of
course, left the door open, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe.-RRB- It
seemed to be still daylight there. <div class="bookquote">``I can always get back if anything goes wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>thought Lucy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
began to walk forward, crunch-crunch over the snow and through the wood towards the other light. In
about ten minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reached it and found it was a lamp-post. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stood looking at it, wondering
why there was a lamp-post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heard a pitter
patter of feet coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among
the trees into the light of the lamp-post.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) carried over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head an umbrella, white with
snow. From the waist upwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was like a man, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) legs were shaped like a goat's -LRB-the hair on
them was glossy black-RRB- and instead of feet he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had goat's hoofs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) also had a tail, but Lucy did not
notice this at first because it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so as to keep it
from trailing in the snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had a red woollen muffler round his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) neck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) skin was rather
reddish too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had a strange, but pleasant little face, with a short pointed beard and curly hair, and
out of the hair there stuck two horns, one on each side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) forehead. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hands, as I have
said, held the umbrella: in the other arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) carried several brown-paper parcels. What with the
parcels and the snow it looked just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) Christmas shopping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was a Faun.
And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw Lucy he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) gave such a start of surprise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dropped all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) parcels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness gracious me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Faun.

<p/>CHAPTER TWO - WHAT LUCY FOUND THERE

<p/><div class="bookquote">``GOOD EVENING,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. But the Faun was so busy picking up its parcels that at first it did
not reply. When it had finished it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a little bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, good evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me - I don't want to be inquisitive - but
should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name's Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), not quite understanding him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are - forgive me - you are what they call a girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm a girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in fact Human?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm human,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, still a little puzzled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun. <div class="bookquote">``How stupid of me! But I've never seen a Son of Adam or a
Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted. That is to say -''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and then it stopped as if it had been going to
say something it had not intended but had remembered in time. <div class="bookquote">``Delighted, delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it went on.
<div class="bookquote">``Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tumnus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very pleased to meet you, Mr Tumnus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And may I ask, O Lucy Daughter of Eve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Mr Tumnus, <div class="bookquote">``how you have come into Narnia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Narnia? What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the land of Narnia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun, <div class="bookquote">``where we are now; all that lies between the lamp-post
and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea. And you - you have come from the wild woods
of the west?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I - I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Mr Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, <div class="bookquote">``if only I had worked harder at geography
when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt know all about those strange countries. It is too late now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they aren't countries at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, almost laughing. <div class="bookquote">``It's only just back there - at least - I'm
not sure. It is summer there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meanwhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Mr Tumnus, <div class="bookquote">``it is winter in Narnia, and has been for ever so long, and we shall
both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow. Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom
where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe, how would it be if you came and
had tea with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much, Mr Tumnus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting
back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only just round the corner,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun, <div class="bookquote">``and there'll be a roaring fire - and toast - and
sardines - and cake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's very kind of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``But I shan't be able to stay long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Mr Tumnus, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be able to hold the umbrella
over both of us. That's the way. Now - off we go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div><p/>And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature as if they
had known one another all their lives.

<p/>They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were
rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down. At the bottom of one small valley Mr Tumnus
turned suddenly aside as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock, but at the last
moment Lucy found he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) was leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) into the entrance of a cave. As soon as they were inside she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire. Then Mr Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece
of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a lamp. <div class="bookquote">``Now we shan't be long,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>)
said, and immediately put a kettle on.

<p/>Lucy thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry, clean cave of reddish stone
with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``one for me and one for a friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Mr Tumnus-RRB-
and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with
a grey beard. In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr Tumnus's bedroom,
and on one wall was a shelf full of books. Lucy looked at these while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) was setting out the tea
things. They had titles like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men,
Monks and Gamekeepers; a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Daughter of Eve!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun.

<p/>And really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and
then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped
cake. And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) had wonderful tales to tell of life
in the forest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the
Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the
milk-white stag who could give you wishes if you caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>); about feasting and treasure-seeking
with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about
summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) fat donkey would come to visit them, and
sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the
whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end. <div class="bookquote">``Not that it isn't always winter
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bacchus</b></font>) added gloomily. Then to cheer himself up he (<font color='blue'><b>Bacchus</b></font>) took out from its case on the dresser a strange
little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and began to play. And the tune he (<font color='blue'><b>Bacchus</b></font>) played made
Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time. It must have been hours
later when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shook herself and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr Tumnus - I'm so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune - but really, I must go home. I
only meant to stay for a few minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good now, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun, laying down its flute and shaking its head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very
sorrowfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No good?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? I've got to go
home at once. The others will be wondering what has happened to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But a moment later she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
asked, <div class="bookquote">``Mr Tumnus! Whatever is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for the Faun's brown eyes had filled with tears and
then the tears began trickling down its cheeks, and soon they were running off the end of its nose; and
at last it covered its face with its hands and began to howl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Tumnus! Mr Tumnus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy in great distress. <div class="bookquote">``Don't! Don't! What is the matter? Aren'
you well? Dear Mr Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But the Faun continued sobbing as if its heart
would break. And even when Lucy went over and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hand
kerchief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) merely took the handker chief and kept on using it, wringing it out with
both hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a
damp patch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Tumnus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>bawled Lucy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ear, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do stop. Stop it at once! You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, a great big Faun like you. What on earth are you crying about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh - oh - oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>sobbed Mr Tumnus, <div class="bookquote">``I'm crying because I'm such a bad Faun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you're a bad Faun at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I think you are a very good Faun. You are the
nicest Faun I've ever met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh - oh - you wouldn't say that if you knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>replied Mr Tumnus between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) sobs. <div class="bookquote">``No, I'm a bad
Faun. I don't suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what have you done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>asked Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My old father, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Mr Tumnus; <div class="bookquote">``that's his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) picture over the mantelpiece. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would never

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A thing like what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like what I've done,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun. <div class="bookquote">``Taken service under the White Witch. That's what I am. I'm

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the worst of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Mr Tumnus with a deep groan. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a kidnapper for her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>), that's what I
am. Look at me, Daughter of Eve. Would you believe that I'm the sort of Faun to meet a poor

and invite it home to my cave, all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the
White Witch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you wouldn't do anything of the sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy rather slowly -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wanted to be truthful and yet not be too hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>)-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``well, that was pretty bad. But you're so sorry for it that I'm sure you will never do it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Daughter of Eve, don't you understand?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't something I have done. I'm doing it

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, turning very white.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Tumnus. <div class="bookquote">``I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but you won't, Mr Tumnus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Yo won't, will you? Indeed, indeed you really

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>), beginning to cry again <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>)'s sure to find out.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry, Mr Tumnus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``But please let me go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I've got to. I see that now. I hadn't known what Humans

we must be off at once. I'll see you back to the lamp-post. I suppose you can find your own way from
there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must go as quietly as we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Mr Tumnus. <div class="bookquote">``The whole wood is full of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) spies. Even
some of the trees are on her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div><p/>They both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr Tumnus once more put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) umbrella
and gave Lucy his (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) arm, and they went out into the snow. The journey back was not at all like the
journey to the Faun's cave; they stole along as quickly as they could, without speaking a word, and
Mr Tumnus kept to the darkest places. Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp-post again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know your way from here, Daughter o Eve?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Tumnus/Tumnus</b></font>)</div>said Tumnus.

<p/>Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of light that
looked like daylight. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I can see the wardrobe door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then be off home as quick as you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Faun, <div class="bookquote">``and - c-can you ever forgive me for what
meant to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) heartily by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``And I do hope you won't get
into dreadful trouble on my account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, Daughter of Eve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, and then ran towards the far off patch of daylight as quickly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) legs would
carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). And presently instead of rough branch brushing past her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt coats, and instead of
crunching snow under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt wooden board and all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found herself jumping out of
the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shut the
wardrobe door tightly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and looked around, panting for breath. It was still raining and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
could hear the voices of the others in the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``I'm here. I've come back I'm all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER THREE - EDMUND AND THE WARDROBE

<p/>Lucy ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I've comeback.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth are you talking about, Lucy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>asked Susan.

<p/>``Why? said Lucy in amazement, <div class="bookquote">``haven't you all been wondering where I was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've been hiding, have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``Poor old Lu, hiding and nobody noticed! You'll have
to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I've been away for hours and hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/>The others all stared at one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Batty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Quite batty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Lu?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>asked Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>answered Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``It was just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe, and I've
been away for hours and hours, and had tea, and all sorts of things have happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``We've only just come out of that room a moment ago, and you
were there then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s not being silly at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s just making up a story for fun, aren't you, Lu? And
why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Peter, I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's - it's a magic wardrobe. There's a wood inside it, and it's snowing,
and there's a Faun and a Witch and it's called Narnia; come and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The others</b></font>)</div><p/>The others did not know what to think, but Lucy was so excited that they all went back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) into
the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rushed ahead of them, flung open the door of the wardrobe and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Now! go in and
see for yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you goose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) head inside and pulling the fur coats apart, <div class="bookquote">``it's just an
ordinary wardrobe; look! there's the back of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>Then everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart; and they all saw - Lucy herself saw - a perfectly
ordinary wardrobe. There was no wood and no snow, only the back of the wardrobe, with hooks on it.
Peter went in and rapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knuckles on it to make sure that it was solid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A jolly good hoax, Lu,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) came out again; <div class="bookquote">``you have really taken us in, I must admit.
We half believed you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it wasn't a hoax at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``really and truly. It was all different a moment ago. Honestly
it was. I promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Lu,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``that's going a bit far. You've had your joke. Hadn't you better drop it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hardly knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
trying to say, and burst into tears.

<p/>For the next few days she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was very miserable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could have made it up with the others quite
easily at any moment if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could have brought herself to say that the whole thing was only a story
made up for fun. But Lucy was a very truthful girl and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was really in the right; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not bring herself to say this. The others who thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was telling a lie, and a silly lie too,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very unhappy. The two elder ones did this without meaning to do it, but Edmund could be
spiteful, and on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was spiteful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'d found any other new countries in other cupboards all over the house. What made it worse was
that these days ought to have been delightful. The weather was fine and they were out of doors from
morning to night, bathing, fishing, climbing trees, and lying in the heather. But Lucy could not
properly enjoy any of it. And so things went on until the next wet day.

<p/>That day, when it came to the afternoon and there was still no sign of a break in the weather, they
decided to play hide-and-seek. Susan was <div class="bookquote">``It''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>and as soon as the others scattered to hide, Lucy went
to the room where the wardrobe was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not mean to hide in the wardrobe, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew
that would only set the others talking again about the whole wretched business. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did want to
have one more look inside it; for by this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia
and the Faun had not been a dream. The house was so large and complicated and full of hiding-places
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have time to have one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere
else. But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reached it she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heard steps in the passage outside, and then there was nothing
for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not shut it properly
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.

<p/>Now the steps she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had heard were those of Edmund; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) came into the room just in time to see
Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) at once decided to get into it himself - not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought
it a particularly good place to hide but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wanted to go on teasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) imaginary
country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opened the door. There were the coats hanging up as usual, and a smell of mothballs, and
darkness and silence, and no sign of Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) thinks I'm Susan come to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)'s keeping very quiet in at the back.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) jumped in and shut the door, forgetting
what a very foolish thing this is to do. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) began feeling about for Lucy in the dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
expected to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in a few seconds and was very surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) decided to open the
door again and let in some light. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not find the door either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) didn't like this at all and
began groping wildly in every direction; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) even shouted out, <div class="bookquote">``Lucy! Lu! Where are you? I know
you're here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own voice had a curious sound - not the sound
you expect in a cupboard, but a kind of open-air sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) also noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was unexpectedly
cold; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw a light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank goodness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``the door must have swung open of its own accord.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) forgot all
about Lucy and went towards the light, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought was the open door of the wardrobe. But
instead of finding himself stepping out into the spare room he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found himself stepping out from the
shadow of some thick dark fir trees into an open place in the middle of a wood.

<p/>There was crisp, dry snow under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feet and more snow lying on the branches of the trees.
Overhead there was pale blue sky, the sort of sky one sees on a fine winter day in the morning.
Straight ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw between the tree-trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear.
Everything was perfectly still, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) were the only living creature in that country. There was not
even a robin or a squirrel among the trees, and the wood stretched as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) could see in every
direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) shivered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) now remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had been looking for Lucy; and also how unpleasant he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``imaginary country''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) thought
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must be somewhere quite close and so he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Lucy! Lucy! I'm here too-Edmund.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s angry about all the things I've been saying lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>thought Edmund. And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not
like to admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been wrong, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) also did not much like being alone in this strange, cold, quiet
place; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) shouted again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Lu! I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I see now you were right all along. Do come out. Make it
Pax.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Still there was no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just like a girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund to himself, <div class="bookquote">``sulking somewhere, and won't accept an apology.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) again and decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not much like this place, and had almost made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mind to go home, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heard, very far off in the wood, a sound of bells. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) listened and the sound
came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer.

<p/>The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was so white that even the snow
hardly looked white compared with them; their branching horns were gilded and shone like
something on fire when the sunrise caught them. Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered
with bells. On the sledge, driving the reindeer, sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three feet
high if he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) had been standing. He (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) was dressed in polar bear's fur and on his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) wore a red hood
with a long gold tassel hanging down from its point; his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) huge beard covered his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) knees and served him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>)
instead of a rug. But behind him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very
different person - a great lady, taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) also was
covered in white fur up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) throat and held a long straight golden wand in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right hand and wore
a golden crown on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was white - not merely pale, but white like snow or paper or
icing-sugar, except for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very red mouth. It was a beautiful face in other respects, but proud and
cold and stern.

<p/>The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towards Edmund with the bells jingling and the
dwarf cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) whip and the snow flying up on each side of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lady dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the Lady, and the dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that they almost sat down. Then
they recovered themselves and stood champing their bits and blowing. In the frosty air the breath
coming out of their nostrils looked like smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what, pray, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lady</b></font>)</div>said the Lady, looking hard at Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm-I'm-my name's Edmund,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund rather awkwardly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not like the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) looked

<p/>at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/>The Lady frowned, <div class="bookquote">``Is that how you address a Queen?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Lady</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) asked, looking sterner than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, your Majesty, I didn't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not know the Queen of Narnia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ha! You shall know us better hereafter. But I repeatwhat are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean. I'm at school - at least I was it's
the holidays now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER FOUR - TURKISH DELIGHT

<p/><div class="bookquote">``BUT what are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen again. <div class="bookquote">``Are you a great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its
beard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``I never had a beard, I'm a boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean you are a Son of Adam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund stood still, saying nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was too confused by this time to understand what the
question meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen. <div class="bookquote">``Answer me, once and for all, or

<p/>I shall lose my patience. Are you human?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A wardrobe? What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I - I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``A door. A door from the world of
men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) is only one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) is easily dealt with.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spoke these words she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) eyes
flaming; at the same moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) wand. Edmund felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was going to do
something dreadful but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seemed unable to move. Then, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gave himself up for lost, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
appeared to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said in quite a different voice, <div class="bookquote">``how cold you look! Come and sit with me here
on the sledge and I will put my mantle round you and we will talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) dared not disobey; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) stepped on to the sledge and
sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) put a fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) fur mantle round him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) and tucked it well in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps something hot to drink?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen. <div class="bookquote">``Should you like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes please, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.

<p/>The Queen took from somewhere among her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) wrappings a very small bottle which looked as if it
were made of copper. Then, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) let one drop fall from it on the snow beside the
sledge. Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid-air, shining like a diamond. But the moment it
touched the snow there was a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that
steamed. The dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile; not a
very nice smile. Edmund felt much better as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) began to sip the hot drink. It was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) right down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) toes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen presently. <div class="bookquote">``What would you like
best to eat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/>The Queen let another drop fall from her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round
box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best
Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted
anything more delicious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was quite warm now, and very comfortable.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was eating the Queen kept asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it
is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) forgot about this and thought only of trying to
shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) ate the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wanted to eat,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a
Faun there, and that no one except himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sisters knew anything about
Narnia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them, and kept on coming
back to it. <div class="bookquote">``You are sure there are just four of you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Two Sons of Adam and two
Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>and Edmund, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept
on saying, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I told you that before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>and forgetting to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Your Majesty'' (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) didn't
seem to mind now.

<p/>At last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box
and wishing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would like some more. Probably the Queen knew
quite well what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was thinking; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted
Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would
even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) did not offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) any
more. Instead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>),

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them
to see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, if you did come again - bringing them with you of course - I'd be able to give you some
more Turkish Delight. I can't do it now, the magic will only work once. In my own house it would be
another matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't we go to your house now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had first got on to the sledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
been afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) might drive away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to some unknown place from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would not be
able to get back; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had forgotten about that fear now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a lovely place, my house,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure you would like it. There are whole
rooms full of Turkish Delight, and what's more, I have no children of my own. I want a nice boy
whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone. While he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was
Prince he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long; and you are much the
cleverest and handsomest young man I've ever met. I think I would like to make you the Prince some day, when you bring the others to visit me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) face had become very red and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mouth and fingers were sticky.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not look either clever or handsome, whatever the Queen might say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but if I took you there now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't see your brother and your sisters. I very
much want to know your charming relations. You are to be the Prince and - later on - the King; that is
understood. But you must have courtiers and nobles. I will make your brother a Duke and your sisters
Duchesses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing special about them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``and, anyway, I could always bring them some
other time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but once you were in my house,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, <div class="bookquote">``you might forget all about thern. You would
be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn't want the bother of going to fetch them. No. You must
go back to your own country now and come to me another day, with them, you understand. It is no

<p/>good coming without them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't even know the way back to my own country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>pleaded Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``That's easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>answered
the Queen. <div class="bookquote">``Do you see that lamp?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) pointed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) wand and Edmund turned and saw the same
lamp-post under which Lucy had met the Faun. ``Straight on, beyond that, is the way to the World of
Men. And now look the other way'- here she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pointed in the opposite direction - <div class="bookquote">``and tell me if you
can see two little hills rising above the trees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my house is between those two hills. So next time you come you have only to find the lamppost and look for those two hills and walk through the wood till you reach my house. But remember you must bring the others with you. I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do my best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, by the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, ``you needn't tell them about me. It would be fun to keep it a
secret between us two, wouldn't it? Make it a surprise for them. Just bring them along to the two hills
- a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that - and when you come to my
house you could just say ``Let's see who lives here<div class="bookquote">'' or something like that. I am sure that would be
best. If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may have heard strange stories about me - nasty
stories that might make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) afraid to come to me. Fauns will say anything, you know, and now -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``please couldn't I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to
eat on the way home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``you must wait till next time.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) signalled
to the dwarf to drive on, but as the sledge swept away out of sight, the Queen waved to Edmund,
calling out, <div class="bookquote">``Next time! Next time! Don't forget. Come soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund was still staring after the sledge when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heard someone calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own name, and looking
round he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw Lucy coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) from another part of the wood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Edmund!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``So you've got in too! Isn't it wonderful, and now-''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all. I'll say I'm sorry
if you like. But where on earth have you been all this time? I've been looking for you everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'd known you had got in I'd have waited for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, who was too happy and excited to
notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) face was. <div class="bookquote">``I've been having
lunch with dear Mr Tumnus, the Faun, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>)'s very well and the White Witch has done nothing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) for letting me go, so he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) can't have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all
right after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The White Witch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``who's she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) is a perfectly terrible person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) calls herself the Queen of Narnia though she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) has
no right to be queen at all, and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and Dwarfs and Animals - at
least all the good ones - simply hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) can turn people into stone and do all kinds of
horrible things. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia - always winter, but it
never gets to Christmas. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) drives about on a sledge, drawn by reindeer, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)
hand and a crown on her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweets, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heard
that the Lady he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had made friends with was a dangerous witch he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) felt even more uncomfortable. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wanted anything else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Tumnus, the Faun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't always believe what Fauns say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, trying to sound as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knew far more
about them than Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who said so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>asked Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone knows it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``ask anybody you like. But it's pretty poor sport standing here
in the snow. Let's go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, let's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Edmund, I am glad you've got in too. The others will have to believe in
Narnia now that both of us have been there. What fun it will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would have to
admit that Lucy had been right, before all the others, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) felt sure the others would all be on the
side of the Fauns and the animals; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was already more than half on the side of the Witch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did
not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would say, or how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) secret once they were all talking about
Narnia.

<p/>By this time they had walked a good way. Then suddenly they felt coats around them instead of
branches and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``you do look awful, Edmund. Don't you feel well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, but this was not true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was feeling very sick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``let's find the others. What a lot we shall have to tell them! And what
wonderful adventures we shall have now that we're all in it together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER FIVE - BACK ON THIS SIDE OF THE DOOR

<p/>BECAUSE the game of hide-and-seek was still going on, it took Edmund and Lucy some time to

<p/>find the others. But when at last they were all together -LRB-which happened in the long room, where the
suit of armour was-RRB- Lucy burst out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peter! Susan! It's all true. Edmund has seen it too. There is a country you can get to through the
wardrobe. Edmund and I both got in. We met one another in there, in the wood. Go on, Edmund; tell
them all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all this about, Ed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter.

<p/>And now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story. Up to that moment Edmund had been
feeling sick, and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy for being right, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hadn't made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind what
to do. When Peter suddenly asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) decided all at once to do the meanest and most
spiteful thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could think of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) decided to let Lucy down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell us, Ed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/>And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) were far older than Lucy -LRB-there was really only a
year's difference-RRB- and then a little snigger and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Lucy and I have been playing pretending that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) story about a country in the wardrobe is true. just for fun, of course. There's
nothing there really.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.

<p/>Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had scored a great
success, and went on at once to say, <div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) goes again. What's the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)? That's the
worst of young kids, they always -''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) savagely, <div class="bookquote">``shut up! You've been perfectly beastly to Lu ever
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) started this nonsense about the wardrobe, and now you go playing games with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) about it
and setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) off again. I believe you did it simply out of spite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's all nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, very taken aback.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it's all nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``that's just the point. Lu was perfectly all right when we left
home, but since we've been down here she (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning
into a most frightful liar. But whichever it is, what good do you think you'll do by jeering and
nagging at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) one day and encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) the next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought - I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) couldn't think of anything to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't think anything at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter; <div class="bookquote">``it's just spite. You've always liked being beastly to
anyone smaller than yourself; we've seen that at school before now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do stop it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan; <div class="bookquote">``it won't make things any better having a row between you two. Let's go
and find Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a good deal later, everyone could see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
been crying. Nothing they could say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) made any difference. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stuck to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) story and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care what you think, and I don't care what you say. You can tell the Professor or you can
write to Mother or you can do anything you like. I know I've met a Faun in there and - I wish I'd
stayed there and you are all beasts, beasts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>It was an unpleasant evening. Lucy was miserable and Edmund was beginning to feel that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) plan
wasn't working as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had expected. The two older ones were really beginning to think that
Lucy was out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind. They stood in the passage talking about it in whispers long after she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
gone to bed.

<p/>The result was the next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the whole thing to
the Professor. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'ll write to Father if he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) thinks there is really something wrong with Lu,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter;
<div class="bookquote">``it's getting beyond us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>So they went and knocked at the study door, and the Professor said <div class="bookquote">``Come
in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>and got up and found chairs for them and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was quite at their disposal. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) sat listening
to them with the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) fingers pressed together and never interrupting, till they had finished the
whole story. After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said nothing for quite a long time. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) throat and said the
last thing either of them expected:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that your sister's story is not true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but -''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the old man's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
perfectly serious. Then Susan pulled herself together and said, <div class="bookquote">``But Edmund said they had only been
pretending.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a point,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor, <div class="bookquote">``which certainly deserves consideration; very careful
consideration. For instance - if you will excuse me for asking the question - does your experience
lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable? I mean, which is the more
truthful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just the funny thing about it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``Up till now, I'd have said Lucy every time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you think, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor, turning to Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, <div class="bookquote">``in general, I'd say the same as Peter, but this couldn't be true - all this about the
wood and the Faun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is more than I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor, <div class="bookquote">``and a charge of lying against someone whom you
have always found truthful is a very serious thing; a very serious thing indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were afraid it mightn't even be lying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan; <div class="bookquote">``we thought there might be something wrong
with Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madness, you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor quite coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you can make your minds easy about
that. One has only to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is not mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, and stopped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had never dreamed that a grown-up would talk like the
Professor and didn't know what to think.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Logic!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor half to himself. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't they teach logic at these schools? There are
only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies, or she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is mad, or she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is telling the truth. You
know she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) doesn't tell lies and it is obvious that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not mad For the moment then and unless any
further evidence turns up, we must assume that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is telling the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>Susan looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) very hard and was quite sure from the expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was no
making fun of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how could it be true, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>asked the Professor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, for one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``if it was true why doesn't everyone find this country every time
they go to the wardrobe? I mean, there was nothing there when we looked; even Lucy didn't pretend
the was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has that to do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, if things are real, they're there all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor Peter</b></font>)</div>said the Professor; and Peter did`nt know quite what to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there was no time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy had no time to have gone anywhere, even if there was
such a place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) came running after us the very moment we were out of the room. It was less than
minute, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pretended to have been away for hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the very thing that makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) story so likely to be true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor. <div class="bookquote">``If there really a
door in this house that leads to some other world -LRB-and I should warn you that this is a very strange
house, and even I know very little about it-RRB- - if, I say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had got into another world, I should not be
at a surprised to find that the other world had a separate time of its own; so that however long you

<p/>stay there it would never take up any of our time. On the other hand, I don't think many girls of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
age would invent that idea for themselves. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been pretending, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have hidden for a
reasonable time before coming out and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you really mean, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``that there could be other worlds - all over the place, just
round the corner - like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing is more probable,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) spectacles and beginning to polish
them, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) muttered to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what they do teach them at these schools.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what are we to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) felt that the conversation was beginning to get off the
point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both
of them, <div class="bookquote">``there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We might all try minding our own business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>). And that was the end of that conversation.

<p/>After this things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all. It had become a
rather alarming subject. And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end;
but that was not to be.

<p/>This house of the Professor's - which even he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) knew so little about - was so old and famous that
people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it. It was the sort of house
that is mentioned in guide books and even in histories; and well it might be, for all manner of stories
were told about it, some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now. And when parties
of sightseers arrived and asked to see the house, the Professor always gave them permission, and Mrs
Macready, the housekeeper, showed them round, telling them about the pictures and the armour, and
the rare books in the library. Mrs Macready was not fond of children, and did not like to be
interrupted when she (<font color='blue'><b>Macready</b></font>) was telling visitors all the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Macready</b></font>) knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Macready</b></font>) had said to Susan and Peter
almost on the first morning -LRB-along with a good many other instructions-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``And please remember

<p/>you're to keep out of the way whenever I'm taking a party over the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange
grown-ups!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, and the other three thought the same. That was how the adventures began
for the second time.

<p/>A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they
could take it to bits when the two girls rushed into the room and said, <div class="bookquote">``Look out! Here comes the
Macready and a whole gang with her (<font color='blue'><b>Macready</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sharp's the word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room. But
when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it, into the Library, they suddenly heard
voices ahead of them, and realised that Mrs Macready must be bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Macready</b></font>) party of sightseers up the
back stairs - instead of up the front stairs as they had expected. And after that - whether it was that
they lost their heads, or that Mrs Macready was trying to catch them, or that some magic in the house
had come to life and was chasing them into Narnia they seemed to find themselves being followed
everywhere, until at last Susan said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh bother those trippers! Here - let's get into the Wardrobe
Room till they've passed. No one will follow us in there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>But the moment they were inside they
heard the voices in the passage - and then someone fumbling at the door - and then they saw the
handle turning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``there's nowhere else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>and flung open the wardrobe. All four of them bundled
inside it and sat there, panting, in the dark. Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for, of
course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) remembered, as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up
in a wardrobe.

<p/>CHAPTER SIX - INTO THE FOREST

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan presently, <div class="bookquote">``I'm
getting horribly cramped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what a filthy smell of camphor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, <div class="bookquote">``to keep away the moths.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something sticking into my back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And isn't it cold?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that you mention it, it is cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``and hang it all, it's wet too. What's the matter with
this place? I'm sitting on something wet. It's getting wetter every minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) struggled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's get out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``they've gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O-o-oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan suddenly, and everyone asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) what was the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sitting against a tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, <div class="bookquote">``and look! It's getting light - over there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove, you're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``and look there - and there. It's trees all round. And this wet stuff
is snow. Why, I do believe we've got into Lucy's wood after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>And now there was no mistaking it and all four children stood blinking in the daylight of a winter
day. Behind them were coats hanging on pegs, in front of them were snow-covered trees.

<p/>Peter turned at once to Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I apologise for not believing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry. Will you shake hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, and did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, <div class="bookquote">``what do we do next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``why, go and explore the wood, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) feet, <div class="bookquote">``it's pretty cold. What about putting on some of these coats?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're not ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter doubtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure nobody would mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan; <div class="bookquote">``it isn't as if we wanted to take them out of the house;
we shan't take them even out of the wardrobe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of that, Su,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, now you put it that way, I see. No one could say
you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it. And I suppose this
whole country is in the wardrobe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>They immediately carried out Susan's very sensible plan. The coats were rather too big for them so
that they came down to their heels and looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put
them on. But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new
get-up and more suitable to the landscape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can pretend we are Arctic explorers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is going to be exciting enough without pretending,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) began leading the way
forward into the forest. There were heavy darkish clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be
more snow before night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>began Edmund presently, <div class="bookquote">``oughtn't we to be bearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are

<p/>aiming for the lamp-post?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had forgotten for the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must pretend never to have been
in the wood before. The moment the words were out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) realised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had given
himself away. Everyone stopped; everyone stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). Peter whistled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you really were here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that time Lu said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>)'d met you in here - and you made out she (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>)
was telling lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a dead silence. <div class="bookquote">``Well, of all the poisonous little beasts -''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, and shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
shoulders and said no more. There seemed, indeed, no more to say, and presently the four resumed
their journey; but Edmund was saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I'll pay you all out for this, you pack of stuck-up,
selfsatisfied prigs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are we going anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, chiefly for the sake of changing the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Lu ought to be the leader,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter; <div class="bookquote">``goodness knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) deserves it. Where will you
take us, Lu?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about going to see Mr Tumnus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>)'s the nice Faun I told you about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone agreed to this and off they went walking briskly and stamping their feet. Lucy proved a
good leader. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wondered whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would be able to find the way, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) recognised an
oddlooking tree on one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground
became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr Tumnus's cave. But there a
terrible surprise awaited them.

<p/>The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside, the cave was dark and cold
and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several days. Snow had
drifted in from the doorway and was heaped on the floor, mixed with something black, which turned
out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fire. Someone had apparently flung it about the room
and then stamped it out. The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun's father
had been slashed into shreds with a knife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a pretty good wash-out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``not much good coming here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, stooping down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had just noticed a piece of paper which had been
nailed through the carpet to the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything written on it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>asked Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think there is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>answered Peter, <div class="bookquote">``but I can't read it in this light. Let's get out into the open
air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) read out the following words:

<p/>The former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) trial on a
charge of High Treason against her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair
Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, etc., also of comforting her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) said Majesty's enemies, harbouring
spies and fraternizing with Humans.

<p/>signed MAUGRIM, Captain of the Secret Police, LONG LIVE THE QUEEN

<p/>The children stared at each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I'm going to like this place after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is this Queen, Lu?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) isn't a real queen at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>answered Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>)'s a horrible witch, the White Witch. Everyone all
the wood people - hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always
winter here and never Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I - I wonder if there's any point in going on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, it doesn't seem particularly safe

<p/>here and it looks as if it won't be much fun either. And it's getting colder every minute, and we've
brought nothing to eat. What about just going home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but we can't, we can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy suddenly; <div class="bookquote">``don't you see? We can't just go home, not after
this. It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) hid me from the Witch
and showed me the way back. That's what it means by comforting the Queen's enemies and
fraternizing with Humans. We simply must try to rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>``A lot we could do! said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``when we haven't even got anything to eat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up - you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, who was still very angry with Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think, Susan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a horrid feeling that Lu is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go a step further and I wish we'd
never come. But I think we must try to do something for Mr Whatever-his-name is - I mean the
Faun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I feel too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``I'm worried about having no food with us. I'd vote for going
back and getting something from the larder, only there doesn't seem to be any certainty of getting into
this country again when once you've got out of it. I think we'll have to go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>said both the girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter.

<p/>They were all still wondering what to do next, when Lucy said, <div class="bookquote">``Look! There's a robin, with such a
red breast. It's the first bird I've seen here. I say! - I wonder can birds talk in Narnia? It almost looks
as if it wanted to say something to us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) turned to the Robin and said, <div class="bookquote">``Please, can you tell us
where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robin</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took a step towards the bird. It at
once flew away but only as far as to the next tree. There it perched and looked at them very hard as if
it understood all they had been saying. Almost without noticing that they had done so, the four
children went a step or two nearer to it. At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once
more looked at them very hard. -LRB-You couldn't have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter
eye.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``I really believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) means us to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've an idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think, Peter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we might as well try it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>answered Peter.

<p/>The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going from tree to tree, always a
few yards ahead of them, but always so near that they could easily follow it. In this way it led them
on, slightly downhill. Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch.
Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew
dazzlingly bright. They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour, with the two girls in
front, when Edmund said to Peter, <div class="bookquote">``if you're not still too high and mighty to talk to me, I've
something to say which you'd better listen to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>asked Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Not so loud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``there's no good frightening the girls. But have you realised
what we're doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) voice to a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know which side that bird is on? Why
shouldn't it be leading us into a trap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a nasty idea. Still - a robin, you know. They're good birds in all the stories I've ever read. I'm
sure a robin wouldn't be on the wrong side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It if comes to that, which is the right side? How do we know that the Fauns are in the right and the
Queen -LRB-yes, I know we've been told she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)'s a witch-RRB- is in the wrong? We don't really know anything
about either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Faun saved Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) did. But how do we know? And there's another thing too. Has anyone the least idea of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great Scott!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``I hadn't thought of that.''

<p/>CHAPTER SEVEN - A DAY WITH THE BEAVERS

<p/>WHILE the two boys were whispering behind, both the girls suddenly cried <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>and stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The robin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``the robin. It's flown away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>And so it had - right out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now what are we to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, giving Peter a look which was as much as to say
<div class="bookquote">``What did I tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sh! Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something moving among the trees over there to the left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all stared as hard as they could, and no one felt very comfortable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There it goes again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw it that time too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``It's still there. It's just gone behind that big tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>asked Lucy, trying very hard not to sound nervous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``it's dodging us. It's something that doesn't want to be seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. And then, though nobody said it out loud, everyone suddenly realised
the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the last chapter. They were lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's it like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's - it's a kind of animal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan; and then, <div class="bookquote">``Look! Look! Quick! There it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>They all saw it this time, a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them from behind a tree.
But this time it didn't immediately draw back. Instead, the animal put its paw against its mouth just as
humans put their finger on their lips when they are signalling to you to be quiet. Then it disappeared
again. The children, all stood holding their breath.

<p/>A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree, glanced all round as if it were afraid
someone was watching, said <div class="bookquote">``Hush'' (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>, made signs to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it
was standing, and then once more disappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter; <div class="bookquote">``it's a beaver. I saw the tail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wants us to go to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, <div class="bookquote">``and it is warning us not to make a noise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``The question is, are we to go to it or not? What do you think, Lu?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's a nice beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but how do we know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't we have to risk it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, it's no good just standing here and I feel I want
some dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the tree and beckoned earnestly to
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter,<div class="bookquote">``let's give it a try. All keep close together. We ought to be a match for one
beaver if it turns out to be an enemy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>So the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it, and there, sure
enough, they found the Beaver; but it still drew back, saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper,
<div class="bookquote">``Further in, come further in. Right in here. We're not safe in the open!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four trees grew so close together that their boughs
met and the brown earth and pine needles could be seen underfoot because no snow had been able to
fall there, did it begin to talk to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're some of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``S-s-s-sh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``not so loud please. We're not safe even here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, who are you afraid of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``There's no one here but ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are the trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Beaver. <div class="bookquote">``They're always listening. Most of them are on our side, but
there are trees that would betray us to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); you know who I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and it nodded its head several
times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it comes to talking about sides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``how do we know you're a friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not meaning to be rude, Mr Beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>added Peter, <div class="bookquote">``but you see, we're strangers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Beaver. <div class="bookquote">``Here is my token.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With these words it held up to them a
little white object. They all looked at it in surprise, till suddenly Lucy said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course. It's my
handkerchief - the one I gave to poor Mr Tumnus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Beaver. <div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got wind of the arrest before it actually happened
and handed this over to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said that if anything happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) I must meet you here and take
you on to -''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here the Beaver's voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nods.
Then signalling to the children to stand as close around it as they possibly could, so that their faces
were actually tickled by its whiskers, it added in a low whisper -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say Aslan is on the move - perhaps has already landed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>And now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than
you do; but the moment the Beaver had spoken these words everyone felt quite different. Perhaps it
has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don't understand
but in the dream it feels as if it had some enormous meaning - either a terrifying one which turns the
whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the
dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that
dream again. It was like that now. At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump

<p/>in its inside. Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror. Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous.
Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>). And
Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realize that it is the beginning of
the holidays or the beginning of summer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about Mr Tumnus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``S-s-s-sh,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``not here. I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also
dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the beaver now, and everyone, including
Edmund, was very glad to hear the word <div class="bookquote">``dinner'' (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisingly quick pace,
and always in the thickest parts of the forest, for over an hour. Everyone was feeling very tired and
very hungry when suddenly the trees began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall
steeply downhill. A minute later they came out under the open sky -LRB-the sun was still shining-RRB- and
found themselves looking down on a fine sight.

<p/>They were standing on the edge of a steep, narrow valley at the bottom of which ran - at least it
would have been running if it hadn't been frozen - a fairly large river. Just below them a dam had
been built across this river, and when they saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course
beavers are always making dams and felt quite sure that Mr Beaver had made this one. They also
noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) now had a sort of modest expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>), face - the sort of look people have when
you are visiting a garden they've made or reading a story they've written. So it was only common
politeness when Susan said, <div class="bookquote">``What a lovely dam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>And Mr Beaver didn't say <div class="bookquote">``Hush''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>this time but
<div class="bookquote">``Merely a trifle! Merely a trifle! And it isn't really finished!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/>Above the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was now, of course, a level floor
of dark green ice. And below the dam, much lower down, was more ice, but instead of being smooth
this was all frozen into the foamy and wavy shapes in which the water had been rushing along at the
very moment when the frost came. And where the water had been trickling over and spurting through
the dam there was now a glittering wall of icicles, as if the side of the dam had been covered all over
with flowers and wreaths and festoons of the purest sugar. And out in the middle, and partly on top of
the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof
smoke was going up, so that when you saw it -LCB-especially if you were hungry-RRB- you at once thought of
cooking and became hungrier than you were before.

<p/>That was what the others chiefly noticed, but Edmund noticed something else. A little lower down
the river there was another small river which came down another small valley to join it. And looking
up that valley, Edmund could see two small hills, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was almost sure they were the two hills
which the White Witch had pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) at the lamp-post that other
day. And then between them, he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) thought, must be her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) palace, only a mile off or less. And he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) thought
about Turkish Delight and about being a King -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``And I wonder how Peter will like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>a King</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) asked
himself-RRB- and horrible ideas came into his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``and it looks as if Mrs Beaver is expecting us. I'll lead the way. But
be careful and don't slip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/>The top of the dam was wide enough to walk on, though not -LRB-for humans-RRB- a very nice place to walk
because it was covered with ice, and though the frozen pool was level with it on one side, there was a
nasty drop to the lower river on the other. Along this route Mr Beaver led them in single file right out
to the middle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it. And when they
had reached the middle they were at the door of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are, Mrs Beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, ``I've found them. Here are the Sons and Daughters of
Adam and Eve'- and they all went in.

<p/>The first thing Lucy noticed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) went in was a burring sound, and the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw was a
kindlooking old she-beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mouth working busily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
sewing machine, and it was from it that the sound came. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) work and got up as soon as
the children came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've come at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, holding out both her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wrinkled old paws. <div class="bookquote">``At last! To think that
ever I should live to see this day! The potatoes are on boiling and the kettle's singing and I daresay,
Mr Beaver, you'll get us some fish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) went out of the house -LRB-Peter went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)-RRB-, and across the ice
of the deep pool to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had a little hole in the ice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) kept open every day with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hatchet.
They took a pail with them. Mr Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) didn't seem to
mind it being so chilly-RRB-, looked hard into it, then suddenly shot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) paw, and before you could say
Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did it all over again until they had a fine
catch of fish.

<p/>Meanwhile the girls were helping Mrs Beaver to fill the kettle and lay the table and cut the bread
and put the plates in the oven to heat and draw a huge jug of beer for Mr Beaver from a barrel which
stood in one corner of the house, and to put on the frying-pan and get the dripping hot. Lucy thought
the Beavers had a very snug little home though it was not at all like Mr Tumnus's cave. There were
no books or pictures, and instead of beds there were bunks, like on board ship, built into the wall.
And there were hams and strings of onions hanging from the roof, and against the walls were gum
boots and oilskins and hatchets and pairs of shears and spades and trowels and things for carrying
mortar in and fishing-rods and fishing-nets and sacks. And the cloth on the table, though very clean,
was very rough.

<p/>Just as the frying-pan was nicely hissing Peter and Mr Beaver came in with the fish which Mr
Beaver had already opened with his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) knife and cleaned out in the open air. You can think how good
the new-caught fish smelled while they were frying and how the hungry children longed for them to
be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before Mr Beaver said, <div class="bookquote">``Now we're
nearly ready.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>Susan drained the potatoes and then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the
side of the range while Lucy was helping Mrs Beaver to dish up the trout, so that in a very few
minutes everyone was drawing up their stools -LRB-it was all three-legged stools in the Beavers' house
except for Mrs Beaver's own special rockingchair beside the fire-RRB- and preparing to enjoy themselves.
There was a jug of creamy milk for the children -LRB-Mr Beaver stuck to beer-RRB- and a great big lump of
deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone took as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) wanted to go
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) potatoes, and all the children thought - and I agree with them - that there's nothing to beat
good freshwater fish if you eat it when it has been alive half an hour ago and has come out of the pan
half a minute ago. And when they had finished the fish Mrs Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the
oven a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot, and at the same time moved the
kettle on to the fire, so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was made and ready to
be poured out. And when each person had got his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) -LRB-or her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>)-RRB- cup of tea, each person shoved back his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) -LRB-or
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>)-RRB- stool so as to be able to lean against the wall and gave a long sigh of contentment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, pushing away his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) empty beer mug and pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) cup of tea towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you'll just wait till I've got my pipe lit up and going nicely - why, now we can get to business.
It's snowing again,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) added, cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) eye at the window. <div class="bookquote">``That's all the better, because it means
we shan't have any visitors; and if anyone should have been trying to follow you, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) won't find
any tracks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER EIGHT - WHAT HAPPENED AFTER DINNER

<p/><div class="bookquote">``AND now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``do please tell us what's happened to Mr Tumnus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``That's a very, very bad business. There's no
doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) was taken off by the police. I got that from a bird who saw it done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where's he (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) been taken to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>asked Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what that means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. Mr Beaver shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) head in a very gloomy fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it means they were taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) House,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what'll they do to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tumnus</b></font>), Mr Beaver?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>gasped Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``you can't exactly say for sure. But there's not many taken in there that ever

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't we have some stratagem?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter. <div class="bookquote">``I mean couldn't we dress up as something, or

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! Tell us about Aslan!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said several voices at once; for once again that strange feeling - like
the first signs of spring, like good news, had come over them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Aslan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>asked Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aslan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver. <div class="bookquote">``Why, don't you know? He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)'s the King. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)'s the Lord of the whole wood,

on it and feel for your hatchet. And that's why the Witch is always on the lookout for any humans in

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>All the children had been attending so hard to what Mr Beaver was telling them that they had noticed

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking ``Who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) last? How long has he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
been missing? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) outside? and then all rushed to the door and looked out. The snow was falling

<p/>thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from
where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank. Out they went,
plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow, and went round the house in every direction.
<div class="bookquote">``Edmund! Edmund!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they called till they were hoarse. But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle
their voices and there was not even an echo in answer.

something about their eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, <div class="bookquote">``we'll still have to go and look for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only Aslan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``we must go on and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). That's our only chance now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``that it is very important to know just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) slipped
away. How much he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) can tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) depends on how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) heard. For instance, had we started talking
of Aslan before he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) left? If not, then we may do very well, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) won't know that Aslan has come to
Narnia, or that we are meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>), and will be quite off her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) guard as far as that is concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) being here when we were talking about Aslan -''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>began Peter, but Lucy

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said miserably; <div class="bookquote">``don't you remember, it was he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) who asked whether the Witch
couldn't turn Aslan into stone too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) did, by Jove,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter; <div class="bookquote">``just the sort of thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) would say, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse and worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``and the next thing is this.

that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/>And of course no one knew the answer to this question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>continued Mr Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)'ll simply sledge down in that direction and get

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right, Mrs Beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``we must all get away from here. There's not a
moment to lose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER NINE - IN THE WITCH``S HOUSE

<p/>AND now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had eaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) share of the
dinner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hadn't really enjoyed it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was thinking all the time about Turkish Delight and there's nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food half so much as the memory of bad
magic food. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had heard the conversation, and hadn't enjoyed it much either, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kept
on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) and trying to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the cold shoulder.
They weren't, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) imagined it. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had listened until Mr Beaver told them about Aslan
and until he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table. It was then that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door. For the mention of
Aslan gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others a mysterious and lovely
feeling.

<p/>Just as Mr Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam's flesh and Adam's bone Edmund had
been very quietly turning the doorhandle; and just before Mr Beaver had begun telling them that the
White Witch wasn't really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess, Edmund had got outside
into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/>You mustn't think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) actually wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother and
sisters to be turned into stone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince -LRB-and later a King-RRB- and
to pay Peter out for calling him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a beast. As for what the Witch would do with the others, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) didn't
want her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) to be particularly nice to them - certainly not to put them on the same level as himself; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) managed to believe, or to pretend he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) believed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wouldn't do anything very bad to them,
<div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``all these people who say nasty things about her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) are her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) enemies and
probably half of it isn't true. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was jolly nice to me, anyway, much nicer than they are. I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)

<p/>is the rightful Queen really. Anyway, she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)'ll be better than that awful Aslan!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At least, that was the
excuse he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) made in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) own mind for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) was doing. It wasn't a very good excuse, however, for
deep down inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) really knew that the White Witch was bad and cruel.

<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) realised when he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) got outside and found the snow falling all round him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), was that he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
had left his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) coat behind in the Beavers' house. And of course there was no chance of going back to
get it now. The next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) realised was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been nearly
three o'clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) hadn't reckoned on
this; but he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had to make the best of it. So he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) collar and shuffled across the top of the
dam -LRB-luckily it wasn't so slippery since the snow had fallen-RRB- to the far side of the river.

<p/>It was pretty bad when he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) reached the far side. It was growing darker every minute and what with
that and the snowflakes swirling all round him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) could hardly see three feet ahead. And then too
there was no road. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) kept slipping into deep drifts of snow, and skidding on frozen puddles, and
tripping over fallen tree-trunks, and sliding down steep banks, and barking his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) shins against rocks, till
he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was wet and cold and bruised all over. The silence and the loneliness were dreadful. In fact I really
think he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends with the
others, if he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) hadn't happened to say to himself, <div class="bookquote">``When I'm King of Narnia the first thing I shall do
will be to make some decent roads.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And of course that set him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) off thinking about being a King and
all the other things he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would do and this cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) up a good deal. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had just settled in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mind
what sort of palace he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would have and how many cars and all about his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) private cinema and where the
principal railways would run and what laws he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would make against beavers and dams and was
putting the finishing touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) place, when the weather
changed. First the snow stopped. Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold. Finally, the
clouds rolled away and the moon came out. It was a full moon and, shining on all that snow, it made
everything almost as bright as day - only the shadows were rather confusing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would never have found his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) way if the moon hadn't come out by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) got to the other
river you remember he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had seen -LRB-when they first arrived at the Beavers'-RRB- a smaller river flowing into
the great one lower down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) now reached this and turned to follow it up. But the little valley down
which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had just left and much overgrown with
bushes, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not have managed it at all in the dark. Even as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) got wet through for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had to stoop under branches and great loads of snow came sliding off on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) back. And every
time this happened he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought more and more how he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hated Peter - just as if all this had been Peter's
fault.

<p/>But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) came to a part where it was more level and the valley opened out. And there, on the
other side of the river, quite close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), in the middle of a little plain between two hills, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) saw
what must be the White Witch's House. And the moon was shining brighter than ever. The House
was really a small castle. It seemed to be all towers; little towers with long pointed spires on them,
sharp as needles. They looked like huge dunce's caps or sorcerer's caps. And they shone in the
moonlight and their long shadows looked strange on the snow. Edmund began to be afraid of the

<p/>House.

<p/>But it was too late to think of turning back now.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the House. There was nothing stirring; not the
slightest sound anywhere. Even his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own feet made no noise on the deep newly fallen snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
walked on and on, past corner after corner of the House, and past turret after turret to find the door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had to go right round to the far side before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found it. It was a huge arch but the great iron gates
stood wide open.

<p/>Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw a sight that
nearly made his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart stop beating. Just inside the gate, with the moonlight shining on it, stood an
enormous lion crouched as if it was ready to spring. And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch,
afraid to go on and afraid to go back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knees knocking together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) stood there so long that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear. How
long this really lasted I don't know, but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours.

<p/>Then at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) began to wonder why the lion was standing so still - for it hadn't moved one inch
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in the shadow of the
arch as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) now saw from the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) at all. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``But supposing it turns its head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>thought Edmund.-RRB- In fact it was staring at
something else namely a little: dwarf who stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) back to it about four feet away. <div class="bookquote">``Aha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>thought Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape.''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>But still the lion
never moved, nor did the dwarf. And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about
the White Witch turning people into stone. Perhaps this was only a stone lion. And as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
thought of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) noticed that the lion's back and the top of its head were covered with snow. Of
course it must be only a statue! No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow. Then
very slowly and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart beating as if it would burst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion.
Even now he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hardly dared to touch it, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hand, very quickly, and did. It was
cold stone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been frightened of a mere statue!

<p/>The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) suddenly got warm all over
right down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) toes, and at the same time there came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) head what seemed a perfectly lovely
idea. <div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)'s
caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) already and turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) into stone. So that's the end of all their fine ideas about him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)!
Pooh! Who's afraid of Aslan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did something very silly and

<p/>childish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) took a stump of lead pencil out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion's
upper lip and then a pair of spectacles on its eyes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Yah! Silly old Aslan! How do you
like being a stone? You thought yourself mighty fine, didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But in spite of the scribbles on it
the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible, and sad, and noble, staring up in the
moonlight, that Edmund didn't really get any fun out of jeering at it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) turned away and began to
cross the courtyard.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) got into the middle of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw that there were dozens of statues all about - standing here and
there rather as the pieces stand on a chess-board when it is half-way through the game. There were
stone satyrs, and stone wolves, and bears and foxes and cat-amountains of stone. There were lovely
stone shapes that looked like women but who were really the spirits of trees. There was the great
shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon.
They all looked so strange standing there perfectly life-like and also perfectly still, in the bright cold
moonlight, that it was eerie work crossing the courtyard. Right in the very middle stood a huge shape
like a man, but as tall as a tree, with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right
hand. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one, Edmund did not like
going past it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of the courtyard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
went to it; there was a flight of stone steps going up to an open door. Edmund went up them. Across
the threshold lay a great wolf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kept saying to himself; <div class="bookquote">``it's only a stone wolf. It can't hurt me'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) leg to step over it. Instantly the huge creature rose, with all the hair bristling along its back,
opened a great, red mouth and said in a growling voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's there? Who's there? Stand still, stranger, and tell me who you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, trembling so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could hardly speak, <div class="bookquote">``my name is Edmund,
and I'm the Son of Adam that Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Majesty met in the wood the other day and I've come to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia - quite close, in the Beavers' house. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) - she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
wanted to see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wolf</b></font>)</div>said the Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``Meanwhile, stand still on the threshold, as you value your
life.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then it vanished into the house.

<p/>Edmund stood and waited, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) fingers aching with cold and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart pounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) chest, and
presently the grey wolf, Maugrim, the Chief of the Witch's Secret Police, came bounding back and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in! Come in! Fortunate favourite of the Queen - or else not so fortunate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Secret Police</b></font>)</div><p/>And Edmund went in, taking great care not to tread on the Wolf's paws.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars, full, as the courtyard had been, of statues.
The one nearest the door was a little faun with a very sad expression on its face, and Edmund couldn't
help wondering if this might be Lucy's friend. The only light came from a single lamp and close
beside this sat the White Witch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm come, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, rushing eagerly forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you come alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch in a terrible voice. <div class="bookquote">``Did I not tell you to bring the
others with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``I've done the best I can. I've brought them quite close.
They're in the little house on top of the dam just up the riverwith Mr and Mrs Beaver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>A slow cruel smile came over the Witch's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this all your news?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, and proceeded to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had heard before leaving the
Beavers' house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Aslan?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen Aslan</b></font>)</div>cried the Queen, <div class="bookquote">``Aslan! Is this true? If I find you have lied to me -''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Queen Aslan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, I'm only repeating what they said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>stammered Edmund.

<p/>But the Queen, who was no longer attending to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hands. Instantly the same dwarf
whom Edmund had seen with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) before appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make ready our sledge,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>ordered the Witch, <div class="bookquote">``and use the harness without bells.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER TEN - THE SPELL BEGINS TO BREAK

<p/>Now we must go back to Mr and Mrs Beaver and the three other children. As soon as Mr Beaver
said, <div class="bookquote">``There's no time to lose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>everyone began bundling themselves into coats, except Mrs Beaver,
who started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said: <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr Beaver, just reach
down that ham. And here's a packet of tea, and there's sugar, and some matches. And if someone will
get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing, Mrs Beaver?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Packing a load for each of us, dearie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Beaver very coolly. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't think we'd set out
on a journey with nothing to eat, did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we haven't time!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, buttoning the collar of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) coat. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) may be here any minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>chimed in Mr Beaver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along with you all,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Think it over, Mr Beaver. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) can't be here for quarter of an
hour at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't we want as big a start as we can possibly get,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``if we're to reach the Stone
Table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to remember that, Mrs Beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) has looked in here and finds
we're gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>)'ll be off at top speed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Beaver. <div class="bookquote">``But we can't get there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) whatever we do, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>)'ll be on
a sledge and we'll be walking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then - have we no hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't you get fussing, there's a dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Beaver, ``but just get half a dozen clean
handkerchiefs out of the drawer. <div class="bookquote">``Course we've got a hope. We can't get there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) but we can
keep under cover and go by ways she (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) won't expect and perhaps we'll get through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true enough, Mrs Beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``But it's time we were out of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't you start fussing either, Mr Beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``There. That's better. There's five
loads and the smallest for the smallest of us: that's you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) added, looking at Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do please come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm nearly ready now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs Beaver at last, allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) husband to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) into;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) snow-boots. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose the sewing machine's took heavy to bring?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver. <div class="bookquote">``A great deal too heavy. And you don't think you'll be able to use it
while we're on the run, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``and breaking it or
stealing it, as likely as not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>said the three children. And so at last they all got outside and
Mr Beaver locked the door -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``It'll delay her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) said-RRB- and they set off, all carrying their loads
over their shoulders.

<p/>The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey. They went in
single file - first Mr Beaver, then Lucy, then Peter, then Susan, and Mrs Beaver last of all. Mr Beaver
led them across the dam and on to the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path
among the trees right down by the river-bank. The sides of the valley, shining in the moonlight,
towered up far above them on either hand. <div class="bookquote">``Best keep down here as much as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)'ll have to keep to the top, for you couldn't bring a sledge down here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable
armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first. But as they went on walking and walking
- and walking and as the sack she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was carrying felt heavier and heavier, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) began to wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was going to keep up at all. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river
with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white masses of the tree-tops and the great glaring moon and
the countless stars and could only watch the little short legs of Mr Beaver going pad-pad-pad-pad
through the snow in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as if they were never going to stop. Then the moon disappeared and
the snow began to fall once more. And at last Lucy was so tired that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was almost asleep and
walking at the same time when suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found that Mr Beaver had turned away from the riverbank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bushes. And then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
came fully awake she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found that Mr Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had
been almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it. In fact, by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) realised
what was happening, only his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) short flat tail was showing.

<p/>Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heard noises of scrambling and
puffing and panting behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and in a moment all five of them were inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wherever is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter's voice, sounding tired and pale in the darkness. -LRB-I hope you know
what I mean by a voice sounding pale.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``and a great secret. It's not much
of a place but we must get a few hours' sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you hadn't all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting, I'd have brought some pillows,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mrs Beaver.

<p/>It wasn't nearly such a nice cave as Mr Tumnus's, Lucy thought - just a hole in the ground but dry
and earthy. It was very small so that when they all lay down they were all a bundle of clothes
together, and what with that and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug. If
only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother! Then Mrs Beaver handed round in the dark a
little flask out of which everyone drank something - it made one cough and splutter a little and stung
the throat, but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you'd swallowed it and everyone went
straight to sleep.

<p/>It seemed to Lucy only the next minute -LRB-though really it was hours and hours later-RRB- when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) woke
up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would like a hot bath. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt a
set of long whiskers tickling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the
cave. But immediately after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was very wide awake indeed, and so was everyone else. In fact
they were all sitting up with their mouths and eyes wide open listening to a sound which was the very
sound they'd all been thinking of -LRB-and sometimes imagining they heard-RRB- during their walk last night.
It was a sound of jingling bells.

<p/>Mr Beaver was out of the cave like a flash the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) heard it. Perhaps you think, as Lucy
thought for a moment, that this was a very silly thing to do? But it was really a very sensible one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>)
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) could scramble to the top of the bank among bushes and brambles without being seen; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) wanted above all things to see which way the Witch's sledge went. The others all sat in the cave
waiting and wondering. They waited nearly five minutes. Then they heard something that frightened
them very much. They heard voices. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>thought Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s been seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)'s caught him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>Great was their surprise when a little later, they heard Mr Beaver's voice calling to them from just
outside the cave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) was shouting. <div class="bookquote">``Come out, Mrs Beaver. Come out, Sons and Daughters of Adam.
It's all right! It isn't Her (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was bad grammar of course, but that is how beavers talk when they are
excited; I mean, in Narnia - in our world they usually don't talk at all.

<p/>So Mrs Beaver and the children came bundling out of the cave, all blinking in the daylight, and with
earth all over them, and looking very frowsty and unbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in
their eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>cried Mr Beaver, who was almost dancing with delight. <div class="bookquote">``Come and see! This is a nasty
knock for the Witch! It looks as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) power is already crumbling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Mr Beaver?''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>panted Peter as they all scrambled up the steep bank of the valley
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>answered Mr Beaver, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)'d made it always winter and never Christmas?
Didn't I tell you? Well, just come and see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/>And then they were all at the top and did see.

<p/>It was a sledge, and it was reindeer with bells on their harness. But they were far bigger than the
Witch's reindeer, and they were not white but brown. And on the sledge sat a person whom everyone
knew the moment they set eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) was a huge man. in a bright red robe -LRB-bright as
hollyberries-RRB- with a hood that had fur inside it and a great white beard, that fell like a foamy waterfall
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) chest.

<p/>Everyone knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) because, though you see people of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) sort only in Narnia, you see pictures of
them and hear them talked about even in our world - the world on this side of the wardrobe door. But
when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different. Some of the pictures of Father Christmas in
our world make him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) look only funny and jolly. But now that the children actually stood looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) they didn't find it quite like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was so big, and so glad, and so real, that they all became
quite still. They felt very glad, but also solemn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) has kept me out for a long time, but I have got in at last. Aslan is
on the move. The Witch's magic is weakening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>And Lucy felt running through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that deep shiver of gladness which you only get if you are being
solemn and still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>said Father Christmas, <div class="bookquote">``for your presents. There is a new and better sewing machine for
you, Mrs Beaver. I will drop it in your house as, I pass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Beaver, making a curtsey. <div class="bookquote">``It's locked up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Locks and bolts make no difference to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>said Father Christmas. <div class="bookquote">``And as for you, Mr Beaver,
when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leaks stopped and a new
sluicegate fitted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Beaver was so pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) mouth very wide and then found he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) couldn't say
anything at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peter, Adam's Son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>said Father Christmas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are your presents,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, <div class="bookquote">``and they are tools not toys. The time to use them is
perhaps near at hand. Bear them well.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) handed to Peter a shield and a sword.
The shield was the colour of silver and across it there ramped a red lion, as bright as a ripe strawberry
at the moment when you pick it. The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword
belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right size and weight for Peter to use. Peter was
silent and solemn as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) received these gifts, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) felt they were a very serious kind of present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Susan, Eve's Daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>said Father Christmas. <div class="bookquote">``These are for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) a bow and a
quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn. <div class="bookquote">``You must use the bow only in great need,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for
I do not mean you to fight in the battle. It does not easily miss. And when you put this horn to your
lips; and blow it, then, wherever you are, I think help of some kind will come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Last of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Lucy, Eve's Daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Lucy came forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a little bottle of
what looked like glass -LRB-but people said afterwards that it was made of diamond-RRB- and a small dagger.
<div class="bookquote">``In this bottle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there is cordial made of the juice of one of the fireflowers that grow in the
mountains of the sun. If you or any of your friends is hurt, a few drops of this restore them. And the
dagger is to defend yourse at great need. For you also are not to be in battle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I think - I don't know but I think I could be brave enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not the point,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But battles are ugly when women fight. And now''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>- here he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
suddenly looked less grave - <div class="bookquote">``here is something for the moment for you all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) brought out -LRB-I
suppose from the big bag at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) back, but nobody quite saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) do it-RRB- a large tray containing five
cups and saucers, a bowl of lump sugar, a jug of cream, and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping
hot. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cried out <div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas! Long live the true King!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) whip, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) and
the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight before anyone realised that they had started.

<p/>Peter had just drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sword out of its sheath and was showing it to Mr Beaver, when Mrs Beaver
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, now then! Don't stand talking there till the tea's got cold. Just like men. Come and help
to carry the tray down and we'll have breakfast. What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread-knife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/>So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr Beaver cut some of the bread and
ham into sandwiches and Mrs Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed themselves. But long
before they had finished enjoying themselves Mr Beaver said, <div class="bookquote">``Time to be moving on now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER ELEVEN - ASLAN IS NEARER

<p/>EDMUND meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time. When the dwarf had gone to get
the sledge ready he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) expected that the Witch would start being nice to him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had been at their last
meeting. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) said nothing at all. And when at last Edmund plucked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) courage to say,
<div class="bookquote">``Please, your Majesty, could I have some Turkish Delight? You - you - said -''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) answered,
<div class="bookquote">``Silence, fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) appeared to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) mind and said, as if to herself, a <div class="bookquote">``And yet it will not
do to have the brat fainting on the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and once more clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) hands. Another, dwarf appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring the human creature food and drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) said.

<p/>The dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with some water in it and an iron

<p/>plate with a hunk of dry bread on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) grinned in a repulsive manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) set them down on the
floor beside Edmund and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turkish Delight for the little Prince. Ha! Ha! Ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>said Edmund sulkily. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want dry bread.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>But the Witch suddenly turned on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with such a terrible expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), apologised and began to nibble at the bread,
though, it was so stale he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could hardly get it down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announced that the sledge was
ready. The White Witch rose and went out, ordering Edmund to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>). The snow was again
falling as they came into the courtyard, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) on the sledge. But before they drove off she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) called Maugrim and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) came bounding like an
enormous dog to the side of the sledge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the
Witch, <div class="bookquote">``and kill whatever you find there. If they are already gone, then make all speed to the Stone
Table, but do not be seen. Wait for me there in hiding. I meanwhile must go many miles to the West
before I find a place where I can drive across the river. You may overtake these humans before they
reach the Stone Table. You will know what to do if you find them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear and obey, O Queen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wolf</b></font>)</div>growled the Wolf, and immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) shot away into the snow and
darkness, as quickly as a horse can gallop. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) had called another wolf and was with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) down on the dam sniffing at the Beavers' house. But of course they found it empty. It would have
been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the children if the night had remained fine, for the wolves
would then have been able to follow their trail - and ten to one would have overtaken them before
they had got to the cave. But now that the snow had begun again the scent was cold and even the
footprints were covered up.

<p/>Meanwhile the dwarf whipped up the reindeer, and the Witch and Edmund drove out under the
archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold. This was a terrible journey for Edmund,
who had no coat. Before they had been going quarter of an hour all the front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was covered with
snow - he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) soon stopped trying to shake it off because, as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did that, a new lot gathered,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was so tired. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was wet to the skin. And oh, how miserable he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was! It didn't look now

<p/>as if the Witch intended to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) a King. All the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had said to make himself believe that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was good and kind and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) side was really the right side sounded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) silly now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would
have given anything to meet the others at this moment - even Peter! The only way to comfort himself
now was to try to believe that the whole thing was a dream and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) might wake up at any
moment. And as they went on, hour after hour, it did come to seem like a dream.

<p/>This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pages about it. But I will skip on
to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and they were racing along in the
daylight. And still they went on and on, with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and the
creaking of the reindeer's harness. And then at last the Witch said, <div class="bookquote">``What have we here? Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>and
they did.

<p/>How Edmund hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was going to say something about breakfast! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had stopped for quite
a different reason. A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party, a squirrel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wife with
their children and two satyrs and a dwarf and an old dogfox, all on stools round a table. Edmund
couldn't quite see what they were eating, but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decorations of
holly and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wasn't at all sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) didn't see something like a plum pudding. At the moment when
the sledge stopped, the Fox, who was obviously the oldest person present, had just risen to its feet,
holding a glass in its right paw as if it was going to say something. But when the whole party saw the
sledge stopping and who was in it, all the gaiety went out of their faces. The father squirrel stopped
eating with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fork half-way to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mouth and one of the satyrs stopped with its fork actually in its
mouth, and the baby squirrels squeaked with terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the meaning of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Witch</b></font>)</div>asked the Witch Queen. Nobody answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak, vermin!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) said again. <div class="bookquote">``Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) whip?
What is the meaning of all this gluttony, this waste, this selfindulgence? Where did you get all these
things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fox</b></font>)</div>said the Fox, <div class="bookquote">``we were given them. And if I might make so bold as to drink
your Majesty's very good health - ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who gave them to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``F-F-F-Father Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fox</b></font>)</div>stammered the Fox.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>roared the Witch, springing from the sledge and taking a few strides nearer to the terrified
animals. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) has not been here! He (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) cannot have been here! How dare you - but no. Say you have
been lying and you shall even now be forgiven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment one of the young squirrels lost its head completely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) has - he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) has - he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) has!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it squeaked, beating its little spoon on the table. Edmund saw the Witch
bite her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) lips so that a drop of blood appeared on her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) white cheek. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wand. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
don't, don't, please don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>shouted Edmund, but even while he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was shouting she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wand
and instantly where the merry party had been there were only statues of creatures -LRB-one with its stone
fork fixed forever half-way to its stone mouth-RRB- seated round a stone table on which there were stone
plates and a stone plum pudding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch, giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) re-mounted the
sledge, <div class="bookquote">``let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors. Drive on!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And Edmund for the first
time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself. It seemed so pitiful to think of those little
stone figures sitting there all the silent days and all the dark nights, year after year, till the moss grew
on them and at last even their faces crumbled away.

<p/>Now they were steadily racing on again. And soon Edmund noticed that the snow which splashed
against them as they rushed through it was much wetter than it had been all last night. At the same
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was feeling much less cold. It was also becoming foggy. In fact every minute
it grew foggier and warmer. And the sledge was not running nearly as well as it had been running up
till now. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought this was because the reindeer were tired, but soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw that that
couldn't be the real reason. The sledge jerked, and skidded and kept on jolting as if it had struck
against stones. And however the dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower.
There also seemed to be a curious noise all round them, but the noise of their driving and jolting and
the dwarf's shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it was, until suddenly the
sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn't go on at all. When that happened there was a moment's silence.
And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the other noise properly. A strange, sweet, rustling,
chattering noise - and yet not so strange, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)'d heard it before - if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could remember where!
Then all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did remember. It was the noise of running water. All round them though out of
sight, there were streams, chattering, murmuring, bubbling, splashing and even -LRB-in the distance-RRB-
roaring. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart gave a great leap -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hardly knew why-RRB- when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) realised that the frost
was over. And much nearer there was a drip-drip-drip from the branches of all the trees. And then, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) looked at one tree he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the first time since he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
entered Narnia he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw the dark green of a fir tree. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hadn't time to listen or watch any longer, for
the Witch said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't sit staring, fool! Get out and help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><p/>And of course Edmund had to obey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) stepped out into the snow - but it was really only slush by
now - and began helping the dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into. They got it
out in the end, and by being very cruel to the reindeer the dwarf managed to get it on the move again,
and they drove a little further. And now the snow was really melting in earnest and patches of green
grass were beginning to appear in every direction. Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long
as Edmund had been looking at it, you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green
patches were after the endless white. Then the sledge stopped again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good, your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf. <div class="bookquote">``We can't sledge in this thaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we must walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall never overtake them walking,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>growled the dwarf. <div class="bookquote">``Not with the start they've got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you my councillor or my slave?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch. <div class="bookquote">``Do as you're told. Tie the hands of the human
creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope. And take your whip. And cut the harness of
the reindeer; they'll find their own way home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/>The dwarf obeyed, and in a few minutes Edmund found himself being forced to walk as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
could with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hands tied behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kept on slipping in the slush and mud and wet grass, and
every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) slipped the dwarf gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) a curse and sometimes a flick with the whip. The Witch
walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying, <div class="bookquote">``Faster! Faster!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/>Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of spow grew smaller. Every
moment more and more of the trees shook off their robes of snow. Soon, wherever you looked,
instead of white shapes you saw the dark green of firs or the black prickly branches of bare oaks and
beeches and elms. Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether.
Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down on to the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky
between the tree tops.

<p/>Soon there were more wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of

<p/>silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with little yellow flowers celandines. The noise of water grew louder. Presently they actually crossed a stream. Beyond it they
found snowdrops growing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind your own business!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf when he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) saw that Edmund had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) head to look at
them; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gave the rope a vicious jerk.

<p/>But of course this didn't prevent Edmund from seeing. Only five minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) noticed a dozen
crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree - gold and purple and white. Then came a sound even
more delicious than the sound of the water. Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly
chirped from the branch of a tree. It was answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off.
And then, as if that had been a signal, there was chattering and chirruping in every direction, and then
a moment of full song, and within five minutes the whole wood was ringing with birds' music, and
wherever Edmund's eyes turned he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw birds alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or chasing
one another or having their little quarrels or tidying up their feathers with their beaks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Faster! Faster!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch.

<p/>There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer, and now there were white
clouds hurrying across it from time to time. In the wide glades there were primroses. A light breeze
sprang up which scattered drops of moisture from the swaying branches and carried cool, delicious
scents against the faces of the travellers. The trees began to come fully alive. The larches and birches
were covered with green, the laburnums with gold. Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate,
transparent leaves. As the travellers walked under them the light also became green. A bee buzzed
across their path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is no thaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf, suddenly stopping. <div class="bookquote">``This is Spring. What are we to do? Your
winter has been destroyed, I tell you! This is Aslan's doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If either of you mention that name again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) shall instantly be killed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER TWELVE - PETER``S FIRST BATTLE

<p/>WHILE the dwarf and the White Witch were saying this, miles away the Beavers and the children
were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream. Long ago they had left the coats
behind them. And by now they had even stopped saying to one another, <div class="bookquote">``Look! there's a kingfisher,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``I say, bluebells!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``What was that lovely smell?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Just listen to that thrush!''  (<font color='red'><b>masses</b></font>)</div>They walked on
in silence drinking it all in, passing through patches of warm sunlight into cool, green thickets and out
again into wide mossy glades where tall elms raised the leafy roof far overhead, and then into dense
masses of flowering currant and among hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almost
overpowering.

<p/>They had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and the whole wood
passing in a few hours or so from January to May. They hadn't even known for certain -LRB-as the Witch
did-RRB- that this was what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia. But they all knew that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)
spells which had produced the endless winter; and therefore they all knew when this magic spring
began that something had gone wrong, and badly wrong, with the Witch's schemes. And after the
thaw had been going on for some time they all realised that the Witch would no longer be able to use
her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) sledge. After that they didn't hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rests and longer
ones. They were pretty tired by now of course; but not what I'd call bitterly tired - only slow and
feeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming to the end of a long day in the
open. Susan had a slight blister on one heel.

<p/>They had left the course of the big river some time ago; for one had to turn a little to the right -LRB-that
meant a little to the south-RRB- to reach the place of the Stone Table. Even if this had not been their way
they couldn't have kept to the river valley once the thaw began, for with all that melting snow the
river was soon in flood - a wonderful, roaring, thundering yellow flood - and their path would have
been under water.

<p/>And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got longer and the flowers began
to think about closing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not long now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver, and began leading them uphill across some very deep, springy
moss -LRB-it felt nice under their tired feet-RRB- in a place where only tall trees grew, very wide apart. The
climb, coming at the end of the long day, made them all pant and blow. And just as Lucy was
wondering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could really get to the top without another long rest, suddenly they were at
the top. And this is what they saw.

<p/>They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading as far as

<p/>one could see in every direction - except right ahead. There, far to the East, was something twinkling
and moving. <div class="bookquote">``By gum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>whispered Peter to Susan, <div class="bookquote">``the sea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>In the very middle of this open hill-top
was the Stone Table. It was a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four upright stones. It looked
very old; and it was cut all over with strange lines and figures that might be the letters of an unknown
language. They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them. The next thing they saw was a
pavilion pitched on one side of the open place. A wonderful pavilion it was - and especially now
when the light of the setting sun fell upon it - with sides of what looked like yellow silk and cords of
crimson and tent-pegs of ivory; and high above it on a pole a banner which bore a red rampant lion
fluttering in the breeze which was blowing in their faces from the far-off sea. While they were
looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right; and turning in that direction they saw what
they had come to see.

<p/>Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creatures who had grouped themselves round him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) in the
shape of a half-moon. There were Tree-Women there and Well-Women -LRB-Dryads and Naiads as they
used to be called in our world-RRB- who had stringed instruments; it was they who had made the music.
There were four great centaurs. The horse part of them was like huge English farm horses, and the
man part was like stern but beautiful giants. There was also a unicorn, and a bull with the head of a
man, and a pelican, and an eagle, and a great Dog. And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom
one carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) crown and the other his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) standard.

<p/>But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn't know what to do or say when they saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at
the same time. If the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they tried to
look at Aslan's face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn,
overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn't look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) and went all trembly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>whispered Mr Beaver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>whispered Peter, <div class="bookquote">``you first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Sons of Adam before animals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>whispered Mr Beaver back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>whispered Peter, <div class="bookquote">``What about you? Ladies first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you're the eldest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>whispered Susan. And of course the longer they went on doing this the more
awkward they felt. Then at last Peter realised that it was up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sword and raised it to

<p/>the salute and hastily saying to the others <div class="bookquote">``Come on. Pull yourselves together,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) advanced to the
Lion and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have come - Aslan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan. <div class="bookquote">``Welcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve.
Welcome He-Beaver and She-Beaver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) voice was deep and rich and somehow took the fidgets out of them. They now felt glad and quiet
and it didn't seem awkward to them to stand and say nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where is the fourth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>asked Aslan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch, O Aslan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver. And then
something made Peter say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was partly my fault, Aslan. I was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) and I think that helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) to go wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) but merely stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) great unchanging eyes. And it seemed to all of them that there was nothing to be said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please - Aslan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``can anything be done to save Edmund?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All shall be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan. <div class="bookquote">``But it may be harder than you think.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was silent again
for some time. Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) face
looked; now it suddenly came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) looked sad as well. But next minute that
expression was quite gone. The Lion shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) mane and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) paws together -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Terrible paws,''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Lion</b></font>)</div>thought Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) didn't know how to velvet them!'' (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>-RRB- and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meanwhile, let the feast be prepared. Ladies, take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and

<p/>minister to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>When the girls had gone Aslan laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) paw - and though it was velveted it was very heavy - on
Peter's shoulder and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come, Son of Adam, and I will show you a far-off sight of the castle
where you are to be King.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>And Peter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sword still drawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge of the hilltop.
There a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun was setting behind their backs. That meant that the
whole country below them lay in the evening light - forest and hills and valleys and, winding away
like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river. And beyond all this, miles away, was the sea, and
beyond the sea the sky, full of clouds which were just turning rose colour with the reflection of the
sunset. But just where the land of Narnia met the sea - in fact, at the mouth of the great river - there
was something on a little hill, shining. It was shining because it was a castle and of course the
sunlight was reflected from all the windows which looked towards Peter and the sunset; but to Peter it
looked like a great star resting on the seashore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That, O Man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan, <div class="bookquote">``is Cair Paravel of the four thrones, in one of which you must sit as
King. I show it to you because you are the first-born and you will be High King over all the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/>And once more Peter said nothing, for at that moment a strange noise woke the silence suddenly. It
was like a bugle, but richer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your sister's horn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan to Peter in a low voice; so low as to be almost a purr, if it is not
disrespectful to think of a Lion purring.

<p/>For a moment Peter did not understand. Then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) saw all the other creatures start forward and
heard Aslan say with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) paw, <div class="bookquote">``Back! Let the Prince win his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) spurs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) did understand, and
set off running as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) could to the pavilion. And there he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) saw a dreadful sight.

<p/>The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction. Lucy was running towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) as fast as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) short legs would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face was as white as paper. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) saw Susan make a dash
for a tree, and swing herself up, followed by a huge grey beast. At first Peter thought it was a bear.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) saw that it looked like an Alsatian, though it was far too big to be a dog. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) realised
that it was a wolf - a wolf standing on its hind legs, with its front paws against the tree-trunk,
snapping and snarling. All the hair on its back stood up on end. Susan had not been able to get higher
than the second big branch. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) legs hung down so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) foot was only an inch or two

<p/>above the snapping teeth. Peter wondered why she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) did not get higher or at least take a better grip;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) realised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was just going to faint and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) fainted she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) would fall off.

<p/>Peter did not feel very brave; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was going to be sick. But that made no difference to
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sword at its side.
That stroke never reached the Wolf. Quick as lightning it turned round, its eyes flaming, and its
mouth wide open in a howl of anger. If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it would
have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) by the throat at once. As it was - though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think
at all - he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had just time to duck down and plunge his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sword, as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could, between the brute's
forelegs into its heart. Then came a horrible, confused moment like something in a nightmare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was
tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead, and its bared teeth knocked against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) forehead, and everything was blood and heat and hair. A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) found that the monster
lay dead and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) sword out of it and was straightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) back and rubbing the sweat
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) face and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) felt tired all over.

<p/>Then, after a bit, Susan came down the tree. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) and Peter felt pretty shaky when they met and I
won't say there wasn't kissing and crying on both sides. But in Narnia no one thinks any the worse of
you for that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick! Quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan</b></font>)</div>shouted the voice of Aslan. <div class="bookquote">``Centaurs! Eagles! I see another wolf in the thickets.
There - behind you. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) has just darted away. After him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>), all of you. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) will be going to his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) mistress.
Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam.''  (<font color='red'><b>wings a dozen</b></font>)</div>And instantly with a
thunder of hoofs and beating of wings a dozen or so of the swiftest creatures disappeared into the
gathering darkness.

<p/>Peter, still out of breath, turned and saw Aslan close at hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have forgotten to clean your sword,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan.

<p/>It was true. Peter blushed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) looked at the bright blade and saw it all smeared with the Wolf's
hair and blood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) stooped down and wiped it quite clean on the grass, and then wiped it quite dry on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hand it to me and kneel, Son of Adam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan. And when Peter had done so he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
with the flat of the blade and said, <div class="bookquote">``Rise up, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane. And, whatever happens, never
forget to wipe your sword.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Now we must get back to Edmund. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been made to walk far further than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had ever
known that anybody could walk, the Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir
trees and yew trees. Edmund simply sank down and lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) face doing nothing at all and not even
caring what was going to happen next provided they would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) lie still. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was too tired even to
notice how hungry and thirsty he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was. The Witch and the dwarf were talking close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in low
tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf, <div class="bookquote">``it is no use now, O Queen. They must have reached the Stone Table by now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be good news if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four thrones in Cair Paravel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch. <div class="bookquote">``How if only three were filled? That would not fulfil
the prophecy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What difference would that make now that He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) is here?''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf. He (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) did not dare, even now,
to mention the name of Aslan to his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) may not stay long. And then - we would fall upon the three at Cair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet it might be better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf, <div class="bookquote">``to keep this one''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>-LRB-here he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) kicked Edmund-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``for bargaining
with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER THIRTEEN - DEEP MAGIC FROM THE DAWN OF TIME

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! and have him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) rescued,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch scornfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf, <div class="bookquote">``we had better do what we have to do at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would like to have it done on the Stone Table itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch. <div class="bookquote">``That is the proper place.
That is where it has always been done before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to its proper use,''  (<font color='red'><b>time the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch; and then, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I will begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen them. They are all at the Stone Table, with Him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). They have killed my captain,
Maugrim. I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all. One of the Sons of Adam killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Fly! Fly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch. <div class="bookquote">``There need be no flying. Go quickly. Summon all our people to meet me here
as speedily as they can. Call out the giants and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are
on our side. Call the Ghouls, and the Boggles, the Ogres and the Minotaurs. Call the Cruels, the
Hags, the Spectres, and the people of the Toadstools. We will fight. What? Have I not still my wand?
Will not their ranks turn into stone even as they come on? Be off quickly, I have a little thing to finish
here while you are away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The great brute bowed its head, turned, and galloped away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we have no table - let me see. We had better put it against the trunk of a tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feet. Then the dwarf set him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) back against

<p/>a tree and bound him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) saw the Witch take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) outer mantle. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) arms were bare
underneath it and terribly white. Because they were so very white he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) could see them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) could not
see much else, it was so dark in this valley under the dark trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prepare the victim,'' (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>, said the Witch. And the dwarf undid Edmund's collar and folded back his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) shirt
at the neck. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) took Edmund's hair and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) head back so that he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) had to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) chin.
After that Edmund heard a strange noise - whizz whizz - whizz. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) couldn't think what
it was. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) realised. It was the sound of a knife being sharpened.

<p/>At that very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heard loud shouts from every direction - a drumming of hoofs and a beating
of wings - a scream from the Witch - confusion all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was being
untied. Strong arms were round him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heard big, kind voices saying things like -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) lie down - give him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) some wine - drink this - steady now - you'll be all right in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heard the voices of people who were not talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) but to one another. And they were
saying things like <div class="bookquote">``Who's got the Witch?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought you had her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) after I knocked
the knife out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) hand - I was after the dwarf - do you mean to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)'s escaped?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- A chap can't
mind everything at once - what's that? Oh, sorry, it's only an old stump!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div>But just at this point
Edmund went off in a dead faint.

<p/>Presently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds -LRB-they were of course the rescue party which
Aslan had sent in the last chapter-RRB- all set off to go back to the Stone Table, carrying Edmund with
them. But if they could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone, I think they might
have been surprised.

<p/>It was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright; if you had been there you would have seen
the moonlight shining on an old tree-stump and on a fairsised boulder. But if you had gone on
looking you would gradually have begun to think there was something odd about both the stump and
the boulder. And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably like a little
fat man crouching on the ground. And if you had watched long enough you would have seen the
stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump; for in reality
the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the dwarf. For it was part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) magic that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)
could make things look like what they aren't, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had the presence of mind to do so at the very
moment when the knife was knocked out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had kept hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wand, so it had been
kept safe, too.

<p/>When the other children woke up next morning -LRB-they had been sleeping on piles of cushions in the
pavilion-RRB- the first thing they heard -from Mrs Beaver - was that their brother had been rescued and
brought into camp late last night; and was at that moment with Aslan. As soon as they had
breakfasted4 they all went out, and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewy
grass, apart from the rest of the court. There is no need to tell you -LRB-and no one ever heard-RRB- what Aslan
was saying, but it was a conversation which Edmund never forgot. As the others drew nearer Aslan
turned to meet them, bringing Edmund with him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and - there is no need to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) about what is past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them in turn, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>and
everyone said, <div class="bookquote">``That's all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>And then everyone wanted very hard to say something which would
make it quite clear that they were all friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) again -something ordinary and natural -and of
course no one could think of anything in the world to say. But before they had time to feel really
awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sire, there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) approach,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan.

<p/>The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch's dwarf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your message, Son of Earth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>asked Aslan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe conduct to come and speak
with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf, <div class="bookquote">``on a matter which is as much to your advantage as to hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Queen of Narnia, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver. <div class="bookquote">``Of all the cheek -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Peace, Beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan. <div class="bookquote">``All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the
meantime we will not dispute about them. Tell your mistress, Son of Earth, that I grant her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) safe

<p/>conduct on condition that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wand behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) at that great oak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/>This was agreed to and two leopards went back with the dwarf to see that the conditions were
properly carried out. <div class="bookquote">``But supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) turns the two leopards into stone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>whispered Lucy to Peter.
I think the same idea had occurred to the leopards themselves; at any rate, as they walked off their fur
was all standing up on their backs and their tails were bristling - like a cat's when it sees a strange
dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>whispered Peter in reply. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) wouldn't send them if it weren't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>minutes the Witch</b></font>)</div><p/>A few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill and came straight across
and stood before Aslan. The three children who had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) before felt shudders running down
their backs at the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) face; and there were low growls among all the animals present. Though
it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold. The only two people present who seemed to be
quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself. It was the oddest thing to see those two faces the golden face and the dead-white face so close together. Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) eyes; Mrs Beaver particularly noticed this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a traitor there, Aslan,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch. Of course everyone present knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) meant
Edmund. But Edmund had got past thinking about himself after all he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)'d been through and after the
talk he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)'d had that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) just went on looking at Aslan. It didn't seem to matter what the Witch
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) offence was not against you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>asked the Witch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us say I have forgotten it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>answered Aslan gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Tell us of this Deep Magic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch voice</b></font>)</div>said the Witch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) voice growing suddenly shriller. <div class="bookquote">``Tell you what is written on that
very Table of Stone which stands beside us? Tell you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long
on the firestones on the Secret Hill? Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor-beyondthe-Sea? You at least know the Magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning. You
know that every traitor belongs to me as my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to

<p/>a kill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>said Mr Beaver. <div class="bookquote">``So that's how you came to imagine yourself a queen - because you were the
Emperor's hangman. I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Peace, Beaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan, with a very low growl. <div class="bookquote">``And so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch mine</b></font>)</div>continued the Witch, <div class="bookquote">``that human
creature is mine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) life is forfeit to me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) blood is my property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Witch mine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and take it then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Bull</b></font>)</div>said the Bull with the man's head in a great bellowing voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch with a savage smile that was almost a snarl, <div class="bookquote">``do you really think your master
can rob me of my rights by mere force? He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knows the Deep Magic better than that. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knows that
unless I have blood as the Law says all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan, <div class="bookquote">``I do not deny it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Aslan!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>whispered Susan in the Lion's ear, <div class="bookquote">``can't we - I mean, you won't, will you? Can't we do
something about the Deep Magic? Isn't there something you can work against it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Work against the Emperor's Magic?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) with something like a frown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
face. And nobody ever made that suggestion to him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) again.

<p/>Edmund was on the other side of Aslan, looking all the time at Aslan's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) felt a choking
feeling and wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) ought to say something; but a moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was not
expected to do anything except to wait, and do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was told.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fall back, all of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan, <div class="bookquote">``and I will talk to the Witch alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/>They all obeyed. It was a terrible time this - waiting and wondering while the Lion and the Witch
talked earnestly together in low voices. Lucy said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Edmund!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>and began to cry. Peter stood with

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) back to the others looking out at the distant sea. The Beavers stood holding each other's paws with
their heads bowed. The centaurs stamped uneasily with their hoofs. But everyone became perfectly
still in the end, so that you noticed even small sounds like a bumble-bee flying past, or the birds in
the forest down below them, or the wind rustling the leaves. And still the talk between Aslan and the
White Witch went on.

<p/>At last they heard Aslan's voice, <div class="bookquote">``You can all come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have settled the matter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)
has renounced the claim on your brother's blood.''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>And all over the hill there was a noise as if
everyone had been holding their breath and had now begun breathing again, and then a murmur of
talk.

<p/>The Witch was just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stopped and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how do I know this promise will be kept?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haa-a-arrh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>roared Aslan, half rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) throne; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) great mouth opened wider and wider
and the roar grew louder and louder, and the Witch, after staring for a moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) lips wide
apart, picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) skirts and fairly ran for her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) life.

<p/>CHAPTER FOURTEEN - THE TRIUMPH OF THE WITCH

<p/>As soon as the Witch had gone Aslan said, ``We must move from this place at once, it will be wanted
for other purposes. We shall encamp tonight at the Fords of Beruna.

<p/>Of course everyone was dying to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had arranged matters with the witch; but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face
was stern and everyone's ears were still ringing with the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) roar and so nobody dared.

<p/>After a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill-top -LRB-for the sun had got strong by now and
dried the grass-RRB-, they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and packing things up. Before
two o'clock they were on the march and set off in a northeasterly direction, walking at an easy pace
for they had not far to go.

<p/>During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) plan of campaign. <div class="bookquote">``As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
has finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) business in these parts,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the Witch and her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) crew will almost certainly fall
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) House and prepare for a siege. You may or may not be able to cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) off and prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)
from reaching it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) then went on to outline two plans of battle - one for fighting the Witch and her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)
people in the wood and another for assaulting her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) castle. And all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was advising Peter how
to conduct the operations, saying things like, <div class="bookquote">``You must put your Centaurs in such and such a place''
 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``You must post scouts to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) doesn't do so-and-so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>till at last Peter said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will be there yourself, Aslan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give you no promise of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>answered the Lion. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) continued giving Peter his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
instructions.

<p/>For the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not talk very
much and seemed to them to be sad.

<p/>It was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valley had widened out and
the river was broad and shallow. This was the Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave orders to halt on this
side of the water. But Peter said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it be better to camp on the far side - for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) should try a night attack or anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>Aslan, who seemed to have been thinking about something else, roused himself with a shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
magnificent mane and said, <div class="bookquote">``Eh? What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>Peter said it all over again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan in a dull voice, as if it didn't matter. <div class="bookquote">``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) will not make an attack to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) sighed deeply. But presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``All the same it was well thought of. That is how
a soldier ought to think. But it doesn't really matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So they proceeded to pitch their camp.

<p/>Aslan's mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feeling uncomfortable too at the idea of
fighting the battle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) own; the news that Aslan might not be there had come as a great shock to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). Supper that evening was a quiet meal. Everyone felt how different it had been last night or even
that morning. It was as if the good times, having just begun, were already drawing to their end.

<p/>This feeling affected Susan so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) couldn't get to sleep when she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) went to bed. And after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had lain counting sheep and turning over and over she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over
just beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you get to sleep either?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you were asleep. I say, Susan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a most Horrible feeling - as if something were hanging over us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you? Because, as a matter of fact, so have I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something about Aslan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Either some dreadful thing is going to happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>), or
something dreadful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)'s going to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's been something wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) all afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy! What was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said
about not being with us at the battle? You don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) could be stealing away and leaving us
tonight, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) here in the pavilion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Susan! let's go outside and have a look round. We might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. Let's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan; <div class="bookquote">``we might just as well be doing that as lying awake here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>Very quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers and crept out of the tent. The
moonlight was bright and everything was quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over
the stones. Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy's arm and said, <div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>On the far side of the camping
ground, just where the trees began, they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them into the wood.
Without a word they both followed him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the right - apparently by
the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table.
On and on he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) led them, into dark shadows and out into pale moonlight, getting their feet wet with the
heavy dew. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew. His (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) tail and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) head hung low
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) walked slowly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) were very, very tired. Then, when they were crossing a wide open
place where there where no shadows for them to hide in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) stopped and looked round. It was no
good trying to run away so they came towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). When they were closer he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, children, children, why are you following me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We couldn't sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy - and then felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) need say no more and that Aslan knew all
they had been thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, may we come with you - wherever you're going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>asked Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well -''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan, and seemed to be thinking. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I should be glad of company tonight.
Yes, you may come, if you will promise to stop when I tell you, and after that leave me to go on
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you, thank you. And we will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>said the two girls.

<p/>Forward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of the Lion. But how slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
walked! And his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) great, royal head drooped so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) nose nearly touched the grass. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
stumbled and gave a low moan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aslan! Dear Aslan!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``what is wrong? Can't you tell us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you ill, dear Aslan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>asked Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan. <div class="bookquote">``I am sad and lonely. Lay your hands on my mane so that I can feel you are there
and let us walk like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>And so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) permission, but what they
had longed to do ever since they first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) buried their cold hands in the beautiful sea of fur and
stroked it and, so doing, walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). And presently they saw that they were going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) up
the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood. They went up at the side where the trees came
furthest up, and when they got to the last tree -LRB-it was one that had some bushes about it-RRB- Aslan
stopped and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, children, children. Here you must stop. And whatever happens, do not let yourselves be seen.
Farewell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/>And both the girls cried bitterly -LRB-though they hardly knew why-RRB- and clung to the Lion and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
mane and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) nose and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) paws and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) great, sad eyes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) turned from them and walked out on
to the top of the hill. And Lucy and Susan, crouching in the bushes, looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>), and this is what
they saw.

<p/>A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and though the moon was shining
many of them carried torches which burned with evil-looking red flames and black smoke. But such
people! Ogres with monstrous teeth, and wolves, and bull-headed men; spirits of evil trees and
poisonous plants; and other creatures whom I won't describe because if I did the grownups would
probably not let you read this book - Cruels and Hags and Incubuses, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets,
Sprites, Orknies, Wooses, and Ettins. In fact here were all those who were on the Witch's side and
whom the Wolf had summoned at her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) command. And right in the middle, standing by the Table, was
the Witch herself.

<p/>A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they first saw the great Lion pacing
towards them, and for a moment even the Witch seemed to be struck with fear. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) recovered

<p/>herself and gave a wild fierce laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``The fool has come. Bind him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan's roar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) spring upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) enemies. But it
never came. Four Hags, grinning and leering, yet also -LRB-at first-RRB- hanging back and half afraid of what
they had to do, had approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Bind him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div>repeated the White Witch. The Hags made a
dart at him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) and shrieked with triumph when they found that he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) made no resistance at all. Then others
- evil dwarfs and apes - rushed in to help them, and between them they rolled the huge Lion over on
his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) back and tied all his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) four paws together, shouting and cheering as if they had done something
brave, though, had the Lion chosen, one of those paws could have been the death of them all. But he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
made no noise, even when the enemies, straining and tugging, pulled the cords so tight that they cut
into his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) flesh. Then they began to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) towards the Stone Table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) first be shaved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>followers</b></font>)</div><p/>Another roar of mean laughter went up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) followers as an ogre with a pair of shears came
forward and squatted down by Aslan's head. Snip-snip-snip went the shears and masses of curling
gold began to fall to the ground. Then the ogre stood back and the children, watching from their
hiding-place, could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different without its mane. The
enemies also saw the difference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s only a great cat after all!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that what we were afraid of?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/>And they surged round Aslan, jeering at him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>), saying things like <div class="bookquote">``Puss, Puss! Poor Pussy,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``How
many mice have you caught today, Cat?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Would you like a saucer of milk, Pussums?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how can they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, tears streaming down her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``The brutes, the brutes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan</b></font>)</div>for now
that the first shock was over the shorn face of Aslan looked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) braver, and more beautiful, and
more patient than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Muzzle him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch. And even now, as they worked about his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) face putting on the muzzle,
one bite from his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) jaws would have cost two or three of them their hands. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) never moved. And
this seemed to enrage all that rabble. Everyone was at him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) now. Those who had been afraid to come
near him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) even after he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was bound began to find their courage, and for a few minutes the two girls
could not even see him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) - so thickly was he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) surrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>),
hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>), spitting on him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>), jeering at him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>).

<p/>At last the rabble had had enough of this. They began to drag the bound and muzzled Lion to the
Stone Table, some pulling and some pushing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was so huge that even when they got him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) there it
took all their efforts to hoist him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) on to the surface of it. Then there was more tying and tightening of
cords.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The cowards! The cowards!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>sobbed Susan. <div class="bookquote">``Are they still afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), even now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/>When once Aslan had been tied -LRB-and tied so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was really a mass of cords-RRB- on the flat stone, a
hush fell on the crowd. Four Hags, holding four torches, stood at the corners of the Table. The Witch
bared her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) arms as she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of Aslan.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) began to whet her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) knife. It looked to the children, when the gleam of the torchlight fell on
it, as if the knife were made of stone, not of steel, and it was of a strange and evil shape.

<p/>As last she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) drew near. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stood by Aslan's head. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) face was working and twitching with passion,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither angry nor afraid, but a little sad. Then, just before she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)
gave the blow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stooped down and said in a quivering voice,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, who has won? Fool, did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor? Now
I will kill you instead of him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) as our pact was and so the Deep Magic will be appeased. But when you
are dead what will prevent me from killing him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) as well? And who will take him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) out of my hand then?
Understand that you have given me Narnia forever, you have lost your own life and you have not
saved his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>). In that knowledge, despair and die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The children did not see the actual moment of the killing. They couldn't bear to look and had covered
their eyes.

<p/>CHAPTER FIFTEEN - DEEPER MAGIC FROM BEFORE THE DAWN OF TIME

<p/>WHILE the two girls still crouched in the bushes with their hands over their faces, they heard the
voice of the Witch calling out,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war! It will not take us long to crush
the human vermin and the traitors now that the great Fool, the great Cat, lies dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great danger. For with wild cries and a
noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns blowing, the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the
hill-top and down the slope right past their hiding-place. They felt the Spectres go by them like a cold
wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under the galloping feet of the Minotaurs; and
overhead there went a flurry of foul wings and a blackness of vultures and giant bats. At any other
time they would have trembled with fear; but now the sadness and shame and horror of Aslan's death
so filled their minds that they hardly thought of it.

<p/>As soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out onto the open hill-top. The moon
was getting low and thin clouds were passing across her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), but still they could see the shape of the Lion
lying dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) bonds. And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) cold face and
stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) beautiful fur - what was left of it - and cried till they could cry no more. And then they
looked at each other and held each other's hands for mere loneliness and cried again; and then again
were silent. At last Lucy said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear to look at that horrible muzzle. I wonder could we take if off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>So they tried. And after a lot of working at it -LRB-for their fingers were cold and it was now the darkest
part of the night-RRB- they succeeded. And when they saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) face without it they burst out crying again
and kissed it and fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam as well as they could. And it was
all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to describe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder could we untie him (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) as well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan presently. But the enemies, out of pure
spitefulness, had drawn the cords so tight that the girls could make nothing of the knots.

<p/>I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan and Lucy were that night;
but if you have been - if you've been up all night and cried till you have no more tears left in you you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing was ever going
to happen again. At any rate that was how it felt to these two. Hours and hours seemed to go by in
this dead calm, and they hardly noticed that they were getting colder and colder. But at last Lucy
noticed two other things. One was that the sky on the east side of the hill was a little less dark than it
had been an hour ago. The other was some tiny movement going on in the grass at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet. At first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took no interest in this. What did it matter? Nothing mattered now! But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw that
whatever-it-was had begun to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table. And now whateverthey-were were moving about on Aslan's body. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) peered closer. They were little grey things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan from the other side of the Table. <div class="bookquote">``How beastly! There are horrid little mice
crawling over him (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>). Go away, you little beasts.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) hand to frighten them away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, who had been looking at them more closely still. <div class="bookquote">``Can you see what they're
doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Both girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Both girls bent down and stared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe -''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``But how queer! They're nibbling away at the cords!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I think they're friendly mice. Poor little things - they don't
realize he (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>)'s dead. They think it'll do some good untying him (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was quite definitely lighter by now. Each of the girls noticed for the first time the white face of the
other. They could see the mice nibbling away; dozens and dozens, even hundreds, of little field mice.
And at last, one by one, the ropes were all gnawed through.

<p/>The sky in the east was whitish by now and the stars were getting fainter - all except one very big
one low down on the eastern horizon. They felt colder than they had been all night. The mice crept
away again.

<p/>The girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes. Aslan looked more like himself without
them. Every moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) dead face looked nobler, as the light grew and they could see it better.

<p/>In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound. It had been so still for hours and hours that
it startled them. Then another bird answered it. Soon there were birds singing all over the place.

<p/>It was quite definitely early morning now, not late night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``Let's walk about a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked to the eastern edge of the hill and looked down. The one big star had almost
disappeared. The country all looked dark grey, but beyond, at the very end of the world, the sea
showed pale. The sky began to turn red. They walked to ands fro more times than they could count
between the dead Aslan and the eastern ridge, trying to keep warm; and oh, how tired their legs felt.
Then at last, as they stood for a moment looking out towards they sea and Cair Paravel -LRB-which they
could now just make out-RRB- the red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very
slowly up came the edge of the sun. At that moment they heard from behind them a loud noise - a
great cracking, deafening noise as if a giant had broken a giant's plate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, clutching Susan's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I - I feel afraid to turn round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan; <div class="bookquote">``something awful is happening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're doing something worse to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) turned, pulling Susan
round with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>).

<p/>The rising of the sun had made everything look so different - all colours and shadows were changed
that for a moment they didn't see the important thing. Then they did. The Stone Table was broken
into two pieces by a great crack that ran down it from end to end; and there was no Aslan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>cried the two girls, rushing back to the Table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's too bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>sobbed Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``they might have left the body alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's done it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>cried Susan. <div class="bookquote">``What does it mean? Is it magic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a great voice behind their backs. <div class="bookquote">``It is more magic.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They looked round. There, shining
in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) before, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) mane -LRB-for it had apparently grown
again-RRB- stood Aslan himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Aslan!''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>cried both the children, staring up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>), almost as much frightened as they were glad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you dead then, dear Aslan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not - not a - ?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>asked Susan in a shaky voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) couldn't bring herself to say the word
ghost. Aslan stooped his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) golden head and licked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) forehead. The warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) breath and a rich
sort of smell that seemed to hang about his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) hair came all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I look it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're real, you're real! Oh, Aslan!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, and both girls flung themselves upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) and
covered him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) with kisses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what does it all mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan, <div class="bookquote">``that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still

<p/>which she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) did not know: Her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) knowledge goes back only to the dawn of time. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) could have
looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) would have
read there a different incantation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) would have known that when a willing victim who had
committed no treachery was killed in a traitor's stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would
start working backwards. And now -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. Now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, jumping up and clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, children,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``I feel my strength coming back to me. Oh, children, catch me if you
can!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) stood for a second, his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) eyes very bright, his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) limbs quivering, lashing himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) tail.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) made a leap high over their heads and landed on the other side of the Table. Laughing,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) didn't know why, Lucy scrambled over it to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). Aslan leaped again. A mad chase
began. Round and round the hill-top he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) led them, now hopelessly out of their reach, now letting them
almost catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) tail, now diving between them, now tossing them in the air with his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) huge and
beautifully velveted paws and catching them again, and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three
of them rolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs. It was such a romp as
no one has ever had except in Narnia; and whether it was more like playing with a thunderstorm or
playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind. And the funny thing was that when all
three finally lay together panting in the sun the girls no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or
thirsty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan presently, <div class="bookquote">``to business. I feel I am going to roar. You had better put your
fingers in your ears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/>And they did. And Aslan stood up and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) mouth to roar his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) face became so terrible
that they did not dare to look at it. And they saw all the trees in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) bend before the blast of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) roaring as grass bends in a meadow before the wind. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have a long journey to go. You must ride on me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) crouched down and the children
climbed on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) warm, golden back, and Susan sat first, holding on tightly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) mane and Lucy sat
behind holding on tightly to Susan. And with a great heave he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) rose underneath them and then shot
off, faster than any horse could go, down hill and into the thick of the forest.

<p/>That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia. Have you ever had
a gallop on a horse? Think of that; and then take away the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of
the bits and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paws. Then imagine instead of
the black or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur, and the mane flying
back in the wind. And then imagine you are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse. But this

<p/>is a mount that doesn't need to be guided and never grows tired. He (<font color='blue'><b>racehorse</b></font>) rushes on and on, never missing
his (<font color='blue'><b>racehorse</b></font>) footing, never hesitating, threading his (<font color='blue'><b>racehorse</b></font>) way with perfect skill between tree trunks, jumping over
bush and briar and the smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largest of all. And you are
riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs, but right across Narnia, in spring, down
solemn avenues of beech and across sunny glades of oak, through wild orchards of snow-white
cherry trees, past roaring waterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes alight
with gorse bushes, and across the shoulders of heathery mountains and along giddy ridges and down,
down, down again into wild valleys and out into acres of blue flowers.

<p/>It was nearly midday when they found themselves looking down a steep hillside at a castle - a little
toy castle it looked from where they stood - which seemed to be all pointed towers. But the Lion was
rushing down at such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time even to ask
themselves what it was they were already on a level with it. And now it no longer looked like a toy
castle but rose frowning in front of them. No face looked over the battlements and the gates were fast
shut. And Aslan, not at all slacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) pace, rushed straight as a bullet towards it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Witch's home!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Now, children, hold tight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down, and the children felt as if they had left
their insides behind them; for the Lion had gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
had yet made and jumped - or you may call it flying rather than jumping - right over the castle wall.
The two girls, breathless but unhurt, found themselves tumbling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) back in the middle of a wide
stone courtyard full of statues.

<p/>CHAPTER SIXTEEN - WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT THE STATUES

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WHAT an extraordinary place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``All those stone animals -and people too! It's -it's like a
museum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, <div class="bookquote">``Aslan's doing something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). Then without waiting a
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) whisked round - almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) had been a cat chasing its tail -and breathed also on the

<p/>stone dwarf, which -LRB-as you remember-RRB- was standing a few feet from the lion with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) back to it. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) pounced on a tall stone dryad which stood beyond the dwarf, turned rapidly aside to deal with a
stone rabbit on his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) right, and rushed on to two centaurs. But at that moment Lucy said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Susan! Look! Look at the lion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>I expect you've seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper which is propped up in a
grate against an unlit fire. And for a second nothing seems to have happened; and then you notice a
tiny streak of flame creeping along the edge of the newspaper. It was like that now. For a second after
Aslan had breathed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) the stone lion looked just the same. Then a tiny streak of gold began to
run along his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) white marble back then it spread - then the colour seemed to lick all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) as the
flame licks all over a bit of paper - then, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) hindquarters were still obviously stone, the lion
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) mane and all the heavy, stone folds rippled into living hair. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) opened a great red
mouth, warm and living, and gave a prodigious yawn. And now his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) hind legs had come to life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
lifted one of them and scratched himself. Then, having caught sight of Aslan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) went bounding after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) and frisking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) whimpering with delight and jumping up to lick his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) face.

<p/>Of course the children's eyes turned to follow the lion; but the sight they saw was so wonderful that
they soon forgot about him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). Everywhere the statues were coming to life. The courtyard looked no
longer like a museum; it looked more like a zoo. Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was almost hidden in the crowd. Instead of all that deadly white the courtyard was
now a blaze of colours; glossy chestnut sides of centaurs, indigo horns of unicorns, dazzling plumage
of birds, reddy-brown of foxes, dogs and satyrs, yellow stockings and crimson hoods of dwarfs; and
the birch-girls in silver, and the beech-girls in fresh, transparent green, and the larch-girls in green so
bright that it was almost yellow. And instead of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the
sound of happy roarings, brayings, yelpings, barkings, squealings, cooings, neighings, stampings,
shouts, hurrahs, songs and laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan in a different tone. <div class="bookquote">``Look! I wonder - I mean, is it safe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the stone giant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan</b></font>)</div>shouted Aslan joyously. <div class="bookquote">``Once the feet are put right, all the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) will follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That wasn't exactly what I meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>whispered Susan to Lucy. But it was too late to do anything
about it now even if Aslan would have listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). The change was already creeping up the

<p/>Giant's legs. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) feet. A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) club off his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) shoulder, rubbed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) eyes and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me! I must have been asleep. Now! Where's that dratted little Witch that was running about
on the ground. Somewhere just by my feet it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But when everyone had shouted up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) to
explain what had really happened, and when the Giant had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) ear and got them to
repeat it all again so that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) understood, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) bowed down till his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) head was no further off
than the top of a haystack and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) cap repeatedly to Aslan, beaming all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) honest ugly
face. -LRB-Giants of any sort are now so rare in England and so few giants are good-tempered that ten to
one you have never seen a giant when his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) face is beaming. It's a sight well worth looking at.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for the inside of this house!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan. <div class="bookquote">``Look alive, everyone. Up stairs and down stairs and
in my lady's chamber! Leave no corner unsearched. You never know where some poor prisoner may
be concealed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>And into the interior they all rushed and for several minutes the whole of that dark, horrible, fusty
old castle echoed with the opening of windows and with everyone's voices crying out at once, <div class="bookquote">``Don't
forget the dungeons - Give us a hand with this door! Here's another little winding stair - Oh! I say.
Here's a poor kangaroo. Call Aslan - Phew! How it smells in here - Look out for trap-doors - Up
here! There are a whole lot more on the landing!''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>But the best of all was when Lucy came rushing
upstairs shouting out,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aslan! Aslan! I've found Mr Tumnus. Oh, do come quick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding each other by both hands and dancing round
and round for joy. The little chap was none the worse for having been a statue and was of course very
interested in all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>).

<p/>But at last the ransacking of the Witch's fortress was ended. The whole castle stood empty with
every door and window open and the light and the sweet spring air flooding into all the dark and evil
places which needed them so badly. The whole crowd of liberated statues surged back into the
courtyard. And it was then that someone -LRB-Tumnus, I think-RRB- first said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how are we going to get out?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>for Aslan had got in by a jump and the gates were still locked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan; and then, rising on his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) hind-legs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) bawled up at the Giant. <div class="bookquote">``Hi!
You up there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) roared. <div class="bookquote">``What's your name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Giant Rumblebuffin, if it please your honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Giant</b></font>)</div>said the Giant, once more touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, Giant Rumblebuffin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan, <div class="bookquote">``just let us out of this, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, your honour. It will be a pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giant Rumblebuffin</b></font>)</div>said Giant Rumblebuffin. <div class="bookquote">``Stand well away from the
gates, all you little `uns.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) strode to the gate himself and bang - bang - bang - went his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) huge
club. The gates creaked at the first blow, cracked at the second, and shivered at the third. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
tackled the towers on each side of them and after a few minutes of crashing and thudding both the
towers and a good bit of the wall on each side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble;
and when the dust cleared it was odd, standing in that dry, grim, stony yard, to see through the gap all
the grass and waving trees and sparkling streams of the forest, and the blue hills beyond that and
beyond them the sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blowed if I ain't all in a muck sweat,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Giant</b></font>)</div>said the Giant, puffing like the largest railway engine.
<div class="bookquote">``Comes of being out of condition. I suppose neither of you young ladies has such a thing as a pockethandkerchee about you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, standing on tip-toes and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) handkerchief up as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could
reach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Missie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giant Rumblebuffin</b></font>)</div>said Giant Rumblebuffin, stooping down. Next moment Lucy got rather a
fright for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found herself caught up in mid-air between the Giant's finger and thumb. But just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was getting near his (<font color='blue'><b>Giant</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>Giant</b></font>) suddenly started and then put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) gently back on the ground muttering,
<div class="bookquote">``Bless me! I've picked up the little girl instead. I beg your pardon, Missie, I thought you was the
handkerchee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy laughing, <div class="bookquote">``here it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Giant</b></font>) managed to get it but it was only about the
same size to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giant</b></font>) that a saccharine tablet would be to you, so that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Giant</b></font>) solemnly
rubbing it to and fro across his (<font color='blue'><b>Giant</b></font>) great red face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it's not much use to you, Mr
Rumblebuffin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the giant politely. <div class="bookquote">``Never met a nicer handkerchee. So fine, so handy. So
- I don't know how to describe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a nice giant he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy to Mr Tumnus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the Faun. <div class="bookquote">``All the Buffins always were. One of the most respected of all the giant
families in Narnia. Not very clever, perhaps -LRB-I never knew a giant that was-RRB-, but an old family. With
traditions, you know. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)'d been the other sort she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)'d never have turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) into stone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/>At this point Aslan clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) paws together and called for silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our day's work is not yet over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and if the Witch is to be finally defeated before bed-time
we must find the battle at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And join in, I hope, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Centaurs</b></font>)</div>added the largest of the Centaurs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan. <div class="bookquote">``And now! Those who can't keep up - that is, children, dwarfs, and small
animals - must ride on the backs of those who can - that is, lions, centaurs, unicorns, horses, giants
and eagles. Those who are good with their noses must come in front with us lions to smell out where
the battle is. Look lively and sort yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did. The most pleased of the lot was the other lion
who kept running about everywhere pretending to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone
he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) met. <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said? Us Lions. That means him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and me. Us Lions. That's what I like
about Aslan. No side, no stand-off-ishness. Us Lions. That meant him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) and me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) went on
saying this till Aslan had loaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) up with three dwarfs, one dryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog.
That steadied him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) a bit.

<p/>When all were ready -LRB-it was a big sheep-dog who actually helped Aslan most in getting them sorted
into their proper order-RRB- they set out through the gap in the castle wall. At first the lions and dogs went
nosing about in all directions. But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave a bay.
There was no time lost after that. Soon all the dogs and lions and wolves and other hunting animals
were going at full speed with their noses to the ground, and all the others, streaked out for about half

<p/>a mile behind them, were following as fast as they could. The noise was like an English fox-hunt only
better because every now and then with the music of the hounds was mixed the roar of the other lion
and sometimes the far deeper and more awful roar of Aslan himself. Faster and faster they went as
the scent became easier and easier to follow. And then, just as they came to the last curve in a narrow,
winding valley, Lucy heard above all these noises another noise - a different one, which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a
queer feeling inside. It was a noise of shouts and shrieks and of the clashing of metal against metal.

<p/>Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw the reason. There stood Peter and
Edmund and all the rest of Aslan's army fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creatures
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had seen last night; only now, in the daylight, they looked even stranger and more evil and
more deformed. There also seemed to be far more of them. Peter's army - which had their backs to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked terribly few. And there werestatues dotted all over the battlefield, so apparently the Witch
had been using her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wand. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) did not seem to be using it now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was fighting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stone
knife. It was Peter she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was fightin - both of them going at it so hard that Lucy could hardly make out
what was happening; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) only saw the stone knife and Peter's sword flashing so quickly that they
looked like three knives and three swords. That pair were in the centre. On each side the line
stretched out. Horrible things were happening wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Off my back, children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>shouted Aslan. And they both tumbled off. Then with a roar that shook all
Narnia from the western lamp-post to the shores of the eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon
the White Witch. Lucy saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face lifted towards him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) for one second with an expression of terror
and amazement. Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witch underneath; and at
the same moment all war-like creatures whom Aslan had led from the Witch's house rushed madly on
the enemy lines, dwarfs with their battleaxes, dogs with teeth, the Giant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) club -LRB-and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) feet
also crushed dozens of the foe-RRB-, unicorns with their horns, centaurs with swords and hoofs. And
Peter's tired army cheered, and the newcomers roared, and the enemy squealed and gibbered till the
wood re-echoed with the din of that onset.

<p/>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN - THE HUNTING OF THE WHITE STAG

<p/>THE battle was all over a few minutes after their arrival. Most of the enemy had been killed in the
first charge of Aslan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) -companions; and when those who were still living saw that the Witch
was dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight. The next thing that Lucy knew was that
Peter and Aslan were shaking hands. It was strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to see Peter looking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) looked now - his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
face was so pale and stern and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) seemed so much older.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was all Edmund's doing, Aslan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter was saying. <div class="bookquote">``We'd have been beaten if it hadn't been for

<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). The Witch was turning our troops into stone right and left. But nothing would stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)
fought his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) way through three ogres to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was just turning one of your leopards into a statue.
And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) had sense to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) sword smashing down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wand instead of
trying to go for her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) pains. That was the
mistake all the rest were making. Once her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wand was broken we began to have some chance - if we
hadn't lost so many already. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) was terribly wounded. We must go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/>They found Edmund in charge of Mrs Beaver a little way back from the fighting line. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was
covered with blood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mouth was open, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face a nasty green colour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan.

<p/>And then, almost for the first time, Lucy remembered the precious cordial that had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
for a Christmas present. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hands trembled so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could hardly undo the stopper, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
managed it in the end and poured a few drops into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brother's mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are other people wounded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was still looking eagerly into Edmund's
pale face and wondering if the cordial would have any result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy crossly. <div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Daughter of Eve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan in a graver voice, <div class="bookquote">``others also are at the point of death. Must more
people die for Edmund?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Aslan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, getting up and going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). And for the next half-hour they were
busy - she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) attending to the wounded while he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) restored those who had been turned into stone. When at
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was free to come back to Edmund she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) standing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feet and not only healed of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wounds but looking better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) look - oh, for ages; in fact ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) first
term at that horrid school which was where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had begun to go wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had become his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) real old
self again and could look you in the face. And there on the field of battle Aslan made him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) a knight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>whispered Lucy to Susan, <div class="bookquote">``what Aslan did for him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>)? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) know what the
arrangement with the Witch really was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! No. Of course not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oughtn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) to be told?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, surely not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan. <div class="bookquote">``It would be too awful for him (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>). Think how you'd feel if you were he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) ought to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. But at that moment they were interrupted.

<p/>That night they slept where they were. How Aslan provided food for them all I don't know; but
somehow or other they found themselves all sitting down on the grass to a fine high tea at about eight
o'clock. Next day they began marching eastward down the side of the great river. And the next day
after that, at about teatime, they actually reached the mouth. The castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill
towered up above them; before them were the sands, with rocks and little pools of salt water, and
seaweed, and the smell of the sea and long miles of bluish-green waves breaking for ever and ever on
the beach. And oh, the cry of the sea-gulls! Have you heard it? Can you remember?

<p/>That evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the beach again and get their
shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between their toes. But next day was more solemn. For
then, in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel - that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west wall
hung with peacock's feathers and the eastern door which looks towards the sea, in the presence of all
their friends and to the sound of trumpets, Aslan solemnly crowned them and led them to the four
thrones amid deafening shouts of, <div class="bookquote">``Long Live King Peter! Long Live Queen Susan! Long Live King
Edmund! Long Live Queen Lucy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well, Sons of Adam! Bear it well,
Daughters of Eve!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aslan/ASLAN</b></font>)</div>said Aslan.

<p/>And through the eastern door, which was wide open, came the voices of the mermen and the
mermaids swimming close to the shore and singing in honour of their new Kings and Queens.

<p/>So the children sat on their thrones and sceptres were put into their hands and they gave rewards and
honours to all their friends, to Tumnus the Faun, and to the Beavers, and Giant Rumblebuffin, to the

<p/>leopards, and the good centaurs, and the good dwarfs, and to the lion. And that night there was a great
feast in Cair Paravel, and revelry and dancing, and gold flashed and wine flowed, and answering to
the music inside, but stranger, sweeter, and more piercing, came the music of the sea people.

<p/>But amidst all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And when the Kings and Queens
noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aslan</b></font>) wasn't there they said nothing about it. For Mr Beaver had warned them, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll be
coming and going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Beaver/Beaver</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beaver</b></font>) had said. <div class="bookquote">``One day you'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and another you won't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) doesn't like being
tied down and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has other countries to attend to. It's quite all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'ll often drop in.
Only you mustn't press him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'s wild,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>you know. Not like a tame lion.''

<p/>And now, as you see, this story is nearly -LRB-but not quite-RRB- at an end. These two Kings and two Queens
governed Narnia well, and long and happy was their reign. At first much of their time was spent in
seeking out the remnants of the White Witch's army and destroying them, and indeed for a long time
there would be news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of the forest - a haunting here and a
killing there, a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumour of a hag the next. But in the end all
that foul brood was stamped out. And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good trees
from being unnecessarily cut down, and liberated young dwarfs and young satyrs from being sent to
school, and generally stopped busybodies and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who
wanted to live and let live. And they drove back the fierce giants -LRB-quite a different sort from Giant
Rumblebuffin-RRB- on the north of Narnia when these ventured across the frontier. And they entered into
friendship and alliance with countries beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits
of state from them. And they themselves grew and changed as the years passed over them. And Peter
became a tall and deep-chested man and a great warrior, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was called King Peter the
Magnificent. And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
feet and the kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) hand in
marriage. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was called Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a graver and quieter man than Peter,
and great in council and judgement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was called King Edmund the Just. But as for Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
always gay and golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to be their Queen, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
own people called her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) Queen Lucy the Valiant.

<p/>So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this world it was only as one
remembers a dream. And one year it fell out that Tumnus -LRB-who was a middle-aged Faun by now and
beginning to be stout-RRB- came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more
appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) parts - the White Stag who would give you wishes if you caught him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>). So these two
Kings and two Queens with the principal members of their court, rode a-hunting with horns and
hounds in the Western Woods to follow the White Stag. And they had not hunted long before they
had a sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) led them a great pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin,
till the horses of all the courtiers were tired out and these four were still following. And they saw the
stag enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow. Then said King Peter -LRB-for they talked in
quite a different style now, having been Kings and Queens for so long-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Fair Consorts, let us now
alight from our horses and follow this beast into the thicket; for in all my days I never hunted a nobler
quarry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kings Queens</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>said the others, <div class="bookquote">``even so let us do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>So they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thick wood on foot. And as soon
as they had entered it Queen Susan said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fair friends, here is a great marvel, for I seem to see a tree of iron.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>said,King Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a
lantern set on the top thereof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the Lion's Mane, a strange device,''  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>said King Peter, <div class="bookquote">``to set a lantern here where the trees cluster
so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>King Peter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Queen Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here there were smaller
trees in the place, or fewer, or none. For this is a young wood and the iron post is old.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And they
stood looking upon it. Then said King Edmund,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not how it is, but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely. It runs in my mind that I
have seen the like before; as it were in a dream, or in the dream of a dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>King Edmund lamp</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered they all, <div class="bookquote">``it is even so with us also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Queen Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``for it will not go out of my mind that if we pass this post and lantern
either we shall find strange adventures or else some great change of our fortunes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>said King Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/EDMUND</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in mine, fair brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>said King Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And in mine too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Queen</b></font>)</div>said Queen Susan. <div class="bookquote">``Wherefore by my counsel we shall lightly return to our
horses and follow this White Stag no further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>said King Peter, <div class="bookquote">``therein I pray thee to have me excused. For never since we four were
Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands to any high matter, as battles, quests, feats of
arms, acts of justice, and the like, and then given over; but always what we have taken in hand, the
same we have achieved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div>said Queen Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``my royal brother speaks rightly. And it seems to me we should be
shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast as now we
have in chase.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Queen Lucy/LUCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so say I,''  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>said King Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``And I have such desire to find the signification of this thing that
I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then in the name of Aslan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Queen</b></font>)</div>said Queen Susan, <div class="bookquote">``if ye will all have it so, let us go on and take the
adventure that shall fall to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Queen Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before they had gone a score of paces they all
remembered that the thing they had seen was called a lamppost, and before they had gone twenty
more they noticed that they were. making their way not through branches but through coats. And next
moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room, and They were no
longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in their old
clothes. It was the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the
wardrobe to hide. Mrs Macready and the visitors were still talking in the passage; but luckily they
never came into the empty room and so the children weren't caught.

<p/>And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn't been that they felt they really must
explain to the Professor why four of the coats out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) wardrobe were missing. And the Professor,
who was a very remarkable man, didn't tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies, but believed the
whole story. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said, ``I don't think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe
door to get the coats. You won't get into Narnia again by that route. Nor would the coats be much use
by now if you did! Eh? What's that? Yes, of course you'll get back to Narnia again some day. Once a
King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia. But don't go trying to use the same route twice.

<p/>Indeed, don't try to get there at all. It'll happen when you're not looking for it. And don't talk too
much about it even among yourselves. And don't mention it to anyone else unless you find that
they've had adventures of the same sort themselves. What's that? How will you know? Oh, you'll
know all right. Odd things they say - even their looks - will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open.
Bless me, what do they teach them at these schools?

<p/>And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe.

<p/>But if the Professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia.

<p/>The End.
