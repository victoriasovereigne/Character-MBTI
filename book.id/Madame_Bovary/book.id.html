<p/>Part I



<p/>Chapter One

<p/>We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a <div class="bookquote">``new
fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the head-master</b></font>)</div>not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a
large desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if
just surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) work.

<p/>The head-master made a sign to us to sit down. Then, turning to the
class-master, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in a low voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Roger, here is a pupil whom I recommend to your care; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll be
in the second. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) work and conduct are satisfactory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will go into
one of the upper classes, as becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``new fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>standing in the corner behind the door so that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
could hardly be seen, was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller
than any of us. His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hair was cut square on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) forehead like a village
chorister's; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) looked reliable, but very ill at ease. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was
not broad-shouldered, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) short school jacket of green cloth with black
buttons must have been tight about the arm-holes, and showed at the
opening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being bare. His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) legs, in
blue stockings, looked out from beneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by
braces, He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.

<p/>We began repeating the lesson. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) listened with all his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ears, as
attentive as if at a sermon, not daring even to cross his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) legs or lean
on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) elbow; and when at two o’clock the bell rang, the master was
obliged to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to fall into line with the rest of us.

<p/>When we came back to work, we were in the habit of throwing our caps on
the ground so as to have our hands more free; we used from the door to
toss them under the form, so that they hit against the wall and made a
lot of dust: it was <div class="bookquote">``the thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had not noticed the trick, or did not dare to attempt
it, the <div class="bookquote">``new fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was still holding his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knees even after
prayers were over. It was one of those head-gears of composite order, in
which we can find traces of the bearskin, shako, billycock hat, sealskin
cap, and cotton night-cap; one of those poor things, in fine, whose
dumb ugliness has depths of expression, like an imbecile's face. Oval,
stiffened with whalebone, it began with three round knobs; then came in
succession lozenges of velvet and rabbit-skin separated by a red band;
after that a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard polygon covered with
complicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long thin cord,
small twisted gold threads in the manner of a tassel. The cap was new;
its peak shone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rise,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stood up; his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cap fell. The whole class began to laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stooped to
pick it up. A neighbor knocked it down again with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) elbow; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) picked
it up once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get rid of your helmet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master bit</b></font>)</div>said the master, who was a bit of a wag.

<p/>There was a burst of laughter from the boys, which so thoroughly put the
poor lad out of countenance that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) did not know whether to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) cap
in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hand, leave it on the ground, or put it on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) sat down
again and placed it on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rise,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>repeated the master, <div class="bookquote">``and tell me your name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>The new boy articulated in a stammering voice an unintelligible name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The same sputtering of syllables was heard, drowned by the tittering of
the class.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Louder!''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>cried the master; <div class="bookquote">``louder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``new fellow''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>then took a supreme resolution, opened an inordinately
large mouth, and shouted at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) voice as if calling someone
in the word <div class="bookquote">``Charbovari.''

 (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div><p/>A hubbub broke out, rose in crescendo with bursts of shrill voices -LRB-they
yelled, barked, stamped, repeated <div class="bookquote">``Charbovari! Charbovari'' (<font color='red'><b>a cracker</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, then died
away into single notes, growing quieter only with great difficulty, and
now and again suddenly recommencing along the line of a form whence rose
here and there, like a damp cracker going off, a stifled laugh.

<p/>However, amid a rain of impositions, order was gradually re-established
in the class; and the master having succeeded in catching the name of
<div class="bookquote">``Charles Bovary,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>having had it dictated to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), spelt out, and re-read,
at once ordered the poor devil to go and sit down on the punishment form
at the foot of the master's desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) got up, but before going hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you looking for?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>asked the master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My c-a-p,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>timidly said the <div class="bookquote">``new fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>casting troubled looks round
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five hundred lines for all the class!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted in a furious voice
stopped, like the Quos ego*, a fresh outburst. <div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>continued the
master indignantly, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) brow with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) handkerchief, which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
had just taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cap. <div class="bookquote">``As to you, `new boy,' you will conjugate
`ridiculus sum' ** twenty times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, in a gentler tone, <div class="bookquote">``Come, you'll find your cap again; it hasn't
been stolen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>*A quotation from the Aeneid signifying a threat.

<p/>**I am ridiculous.

<p/>Quiet was restored. Heads bent over desks, and the <div class="bookquote">``new fellow''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remained
for two hours in an exemplary attitude, although from time to time some
paper pellet flipped from the tip of a pen came bang in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) face. But he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) face with one hand and continued motionless, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes lowered.

<p/>In the evening, at preparation, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pens from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) desk,
arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) small belongings, and carefully ruled his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) paper. We saw him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
working conscientiously, looking up every word in the dictionary, and
taking the greatest pains. Thanks, no doubt, to the willingness he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
showed, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had not to go down to the class below. But though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
rules passably, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had little finish in composition. It was the cure
of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) village who had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) first Latin; his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) parents, from
motives of economy, having sent him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to school as late as possible.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, retired
assistant-surgeon-major, compromised about 1812 in certain conscription
scandals, and forced at this time to leave the service, had taken
advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) fine figure to get hold of a dowry of sixty thousand
francs that offered in the person of a hosier's daughter who had fallen
in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) good looks. A fine man, a great talker, making his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
spurs ring as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked, wearing whiskers that ran into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moustache,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers always garnished with rings and dressed in loud colours,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the dash of a military man with the easy go of a commercial
traveller.

<p/>Once married, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) lived for three or four years on his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) wife's fortune,
dining well, rising late, smoking long porcelain pipes, not coming in
at night till after the theatre, and haunting cafes. The father-in-law
died, leaving little; he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) was indignant at this, <div class="bookquote">``went in for the
business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>lost some money in it, then retired to the country, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) would make money.

<p/>But, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) knew no more about farming than calico, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) rode his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) horses
instead of sending them to plough, drank his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) cider in bottle instead of
selling it in cask, ate the finest poultry in his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) farmyard, and greased
his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) hunting-boots with the fat of his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) pigs, he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) was not long in finding
out that he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) would do better to give up all speculation.

<p/>For two hundred francs a year he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) managed to live on the border of
the provinces of Caux and Picardy, in a kind of place half farm, half
private house; and here, soured, eaten up with regrets, cursing his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)
luck, jealous of everyone, he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) shut himself up at the age of forty-five,
sick of men, he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) said, and determined to live at peace.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) wife had adored him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) once on a time; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had bored him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) with a
thousand servilities that had only estranged him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) the more. Lively once,
expansive and affectionate, in growing older she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had become -LRB-after the
fashion of wine that, exposed to air, turns to vinegar-RRB- ill-tempered,
grumbling, irritable. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had suffered so much without complaint at
first, until she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had seem him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) going after all the village drabs, and
until a score of bad houses sent him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at night, weary,
stinking drunk. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pride revolted. After that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was silent,
burying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) anger in a dumb stoicism that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) maintained till her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was constantly going about looking after business matters. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
called on the lawyers, the president, remembered when bills fell due,
got them renewed, and at home ironed, sewed, washed, looked after the
workmen, paid the accounts, while he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>), troubling himself about nothing,
eternally besotted in sleepy sulkiness, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) only roused himself
to say disagreeable things to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), sat smoking by the fire and spitting
into the cinders.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had a child, it had to be sent out to nurse. When he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) came home,
the lad was spoilt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) were a prince. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother stuffed him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
with jam; his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father let him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) run about barefoot, and, playing the
philosopher, even said he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) might as well go about quite naked like the
young of animals. As opposed to the maternal ideas, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had a certain
virile idea of childhood on which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) sought to mould his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) son, wishing
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to be brought up hardily, like a Spartan, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a strong
constitution. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to bed without any fire, taught him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to drink
off large draughts of rum and to jeer at religious processions. But,
peaceable by nature, the lad answered only poorly to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) notions. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
mother always kept him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cut out cardboard for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), told him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
tales, entertained him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) with endless monologues full of melancholy gaiety
and charming nonsense. In her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life's isolation she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) centered on the
child's head all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shattered, broken little vanities. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dreamed of
high station; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) already saw him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), tall, handsome, clever, settled as
an engineer or in the law. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) taught him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) to read, and even, on an old
piano, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) two or three little songs. But to all this
Monsieur Bovary, caring little for letters, said, <div class="bookquote">``It was not worth
while. Would they ever have the means to send him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to a public school, to
buy him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a practice, or start him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in business? Besides, with cheek a man
always gets on in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Bovary</b></font>)</div>Madame Bovary bit her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips, and the child
knocked about the village.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) went after the labourers, drove away with clods of earth the ravens
that were flying about. He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) ate blackberries along the hedges, minded the
geese with a long switch, went haymaking during harvest, ran about in
the woods, played hop-scotch under the church porch on rainy days, and
at great fetes begged the beadle to let him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) toll the bells, that he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>)
might hang all his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) weight on the long rope and feel himself borne upward
by it in its swing. Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) grew like an oak; he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) was strong on
hand, fresh of colour.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) was twelve years old his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) mother had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own way; he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) began
lessons. The cure took him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) in hand; but the lessons were so short and
irregular that they could not be of much use. They were given at spare
moments in the sacristy, standing up, hurriedly, between a baptism and
a burial; or else the cure, if he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) had not to go out, sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) pupil
after the Angelus*. They went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) room and settled down; the
flies and moths fluttered round the candle. It was close, the child
fell asleep, and the good man, beginning to doze with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stomach, was soon snoring with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth wide open. On other occasions,
when Monsieur le Cure, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way back after administering the viaticum
to some sick person in the neighbourhood, caught sight of Charles
playing about the fields, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), lectured him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) for a quarter of
an hour and took advantage of the occasion to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) conjugate his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
verb at the foot of a tree. The rain interrupted them or an acquaintance
passed. All the same he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was always pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), and even said the
<div class="bookquote">``young man''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>had a very good memory.

<p/>*A devotion said at morning, noon, and evening, at the sound
of a bell. Here, the evening prayer.

<p/>Charles could not go on like this. Madame Bovary took strong steps.
Ashamed, or rather tired out, Monsieur Bovary gave in without a
struggle, and they waited one year longer, so that the lad should take
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) first communion.

<p/>Six months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally sent to
school at Rouen, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) towards the end of October,
at the time of the St. Romain fair.

<p/>It would now be impossible for any of us to remember anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was a youth of even temperament, who played in playtime, worked in
school-hours, was attentive in class, slept well in the dormitory,
and ate well in the refectory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had in loco parentis* a wholesale
ironmonger in the Rue Ganterie, who took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) out once a month on Sundays
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shop was shut, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) for a walk on the quay to look at
the boats, and then brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back to college at seven o’clock before
supper. Every Thursday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wrote a long letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother with
red ink and three wafers; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) history note-books, or
read an old volume of <div class="bookquote">``Anarchasis''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that was knocking about the study.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went for walks he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) talked to the servant, who, like himself, came
from the country.

<p/>*In place of a parent.

<p/>By dint of hard work he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) kept always about the middle of the class; once
even he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) got a certificate in natural history. But at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
third year his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) parents withdrew him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) from the school to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) study
medicine, convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could even take his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) degree by himself.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother chose a room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) on the fourth floor of a dyer's she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
knew, overlooking the Eau-de-Robec. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made arrangements for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
board, got him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) furniture, table and two chairs, sent home for an old
cherry-tree bedstead, and bought besides a small cast-iron stove with
the supply of wood that was to warm the poor child.

<p/>Then at the end of a week she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) departed, after a thousand injunctions to
be good now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was going to be left to himself.

<p/>The syllabus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) read on the notice-board stunned him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); lectures
on anatomy, lectures on pathology, lectures on physiology, lectures on
pharmacy, lectures on botany and clinical medicine, and therapeutics,
without counting hygiene and materia medica--all names of whose
etymologies he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was ignorant, and that were to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as so many doors to
sanctuaries filled with magnificent darkness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) understood nothing of it all; it was all very well to listen--he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did
not follow. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) worked; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had bound note-books, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) attended all
the courses, never missed a single lecture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) little daily task
like a mill-horse, who goes round and round with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes bandaged, not
knowing what work he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is doing.

<p/>To spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) expense his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) every week by the carrier a
piece of veal baked in the oven, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lunched when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came back
from the hospital, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sat kicking his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feet against the wall.
After this he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had to run off to lectures, to the operation-room, to the
hospital, and return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) home at the other end of the town. In the
evening, after the poor dinner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) landlord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
room and set to work again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wet clothes, which smoked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sat in
front of the hot stove.

<p/>On the fine summer evenings, at the time when the close streets are
empty, when the servants are playing shuttle-cock at the doors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) window and leaned out. The river, that makes of this quarter
of Rouen a wretched little Venice, flowed beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), between the
bridges and the railings, yellow, violet, or blue. Working men, kneeling
on the banks, washed their bare arms in the water. On poles projecting
from the attics, skeins of cotton were drying in the air. Opposite,
beyond the roots spread the pure heaven with the red sun setting. How
pleasant it must be at home! How fresh under the beech-tree! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
expanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) nostrils to breathe in the sweet odours of the country
which did not reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grew thin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) figure became taller, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face took a saddened look
that made it nearly interesting. Naturally, through indifference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
abandoned all the resolutions he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had made. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) missed a lecture; the
next day all the lectures; and, enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) idleness, little by little,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gave up work altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) got into the habit of going to the
public-house, and had a passion for dominoes. To shut himself up every
evening in the dirty public room, to push about on marble tables the
small sheep bones with black dots, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a fine proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
freedom, which raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own esteem. It was beginning to see
life, the sweetness of stolen pleasures; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) entered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand on the door-handle with a joy almost sensual. Then many things
hidden within him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) learnt couplets by heart and sang them to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) boon companions, became enthusiastic about Beranger, learnt how to
make punch, and, finally, how to make love.

<p/>Thanks to these preparatory labours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) failed completely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
examination for an ordinary degree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was expected home the same night
to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) started on foot, stopped at the beginning
of the village, sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) excused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), threw the blame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) failure on the injustice of the examiners,
encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a little, and took upon herself to set matters straight.
It was only five years later that Monsieur Bovary knew the truth; it was
old then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) accepted it. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not believe that a man
born of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could be a fool.

<p/>So Charles set to work again and crammed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) examination,
ceaselessly learning all the old questions by heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) passed pretty
well. What a happy day for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother! They gave a grand dinner.

<p/>Where should he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) go to practice? To Tostes, where there was only one old
doctor. For a long time Madame Bovary had been on the look-out for his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
death, and the old fellow had barely been packed off when Charles was
installed, opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) place, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) successor.

<p/>But it was not everything to have brought up a son, to have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
taught medicine, and discovered Tostes, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could practice it;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must have a wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) one--the widow of a bailiff at
Dieppe--who was forty-five and had an income of twelve hundred francs.
Though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was ugly, as dry as a bone, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face with as many pimples as
the spring has buds, Madame Dubuc had no lack of suitors. To attain her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
ends Madame Bovary had to oust them all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) even succeeded in
very cleverly baffling the intrigues of a port-butcher backed up by the
priests.

<p/>Charles had seen in marriage the advent of an easier life, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
would be more free to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) liked with himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) money. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wife was master; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had to say this and not say that in company, to fast
every Friday, dress as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked, harass at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bidding those patients
who did not pay. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) letter, watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) comings and goings,
and listened at the partition-wall when women came to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
surgery.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chocolate every morning, attentions without end. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
constantly complained of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nerves, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chest, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liver. The noise of
footsteps made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ill; when people left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), solitude became odious to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); if they came back, it was doubtless to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) die. When Charles
returned in the evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stretched forth two long thin arms from
beneath the sheets, put them round his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) neck, and having made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sit
down on the edge of the bed, began to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) troubles: he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) loved another. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been warned she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would be
unhappy; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ended by asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) for a dose of medicine and a little
more love.



<p/>Chapter Two

<p/>One night towards eleven o’clock they were awakened by the noise of
a horse pulling up outside their door. The servant opened the
garret-window and parleyed for some time with a man in the street below.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came for the doctor, had a letter for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Natasie came downstairs
shivering and undid the bars and bolts one after the other. The man left
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse, and, following the servant, suddenly came in behind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pulled out from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wool cap with grey top-knots a letter wrapped up in
a rag and presented it gingerly to Charles, who rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) elbow on
the pillow to read it. Natasie, standing near the bed, held the light.
Madame in modesty had turned to the wall and showed only her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) back.

<p/>This letter, sealed with a small seal in blue wax, begged Monsieur
Bovary to come immediately to the farm of the Bertaux to set a broken
leg. Now from Tostes to the Bertaux was a good eighteen miles across
country by way of Longueville and Saint-Victor. It was a dark night;
Madame Bovary junior was afraid of accidents for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. So it was
decided the stable-boy should go on first; Charles would start three
hours later when the moon rose. A boy was to be sent to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and
show him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the way to the farm, and open the gates for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>Towards four o’clock in the morning, Charles, well wrapped up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
cloak, set out for the Bertaux. Still sleepy from the warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) horse. When it stopped
of its own accord in front of those holes surrounded with thorns that
are dug on the margin of furrows, Charles awoke with a start, suddenly
remembered the broken leg, and tried to call to mind all the fractures
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew. The rain had stopped, day was breaking, and on the branches
of the leafless trees birds roosted motionless, their little feathers
bristling in the cold morning wind. The flat country stretched as far as
eye could see, and the tufts of trees round the farms at long intervals
seemed like dark violet stains on the cast grey surface, that on the
horizon faded into the gloom of the sky.

<p/>Charles from time to time opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mind grew weary, and,
sleep coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) soon fell into a doze wherein, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recent
sensations blending with memories, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) became conscious of a double
self, at once student and married man, lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed as but now, and
crossing the operation theatre as of old. The warm smell of poultices
mingled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain with the fresh odour of dew; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the iron
rings rattling along the curtain-rods of the bed and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife
sleeping. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed Vassonville he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came upon a boy sitting on the
grass at the edge of a ditch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you the doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asked the child.

<p/>And on Charles's answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wooden shoes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands and ran on
in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>The general practitioner, riding along, gathered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) guide's talk
that Monsieur Rouault must be one of the well-to-do farmers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) leg the evening before on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) way home from a
Twelfth-night feast at a neighbour's. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) wife had been dead for two
years. There was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) only his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) daughter, who helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) to keep
house.

<p/>The ruts were becoming deeper; they were approaching the Bertaux.

<p/>The little lad, slipping through a hole in the hedge, disappeared;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) came back to the end of a courtyard to open the gate. The
horse slipped on the wet grass; Charles had to stoop to pass under
the branches. The watchdogs in their kennels barked, dragging at their
chains. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) entered the Bertaux, the horse took fright and stumbled.

<p/>It was a substantial-looking farm. In the stables, over the top of the
open doors, one could see great cart-horses quietly feeding from new
racks. Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from
which manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six
peacocks, a luxury in Chauchois farmyards, were foraging on the top of
it. The sheepfold was long, the barn high, with walls smooth as your
hand. Under the cart-shed were two large carts and four ploughs, with
their whips, shafts and harnesses complete, whose fleeces of blue wool
were getting soiled by the fine dust that fell from the granaries. The
courtyard sloped upwards, planted with trees set out symmetrically, and
the chattering noise of a flock of geese was heard near the pond.

<p/>A young woman in a blue merino dress with three flounces came to the
threshold of the door to receive Monsieur Bovary, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) led to the
kitchen, where a large fire was blazing. The servant's breakfast was
boiling beside it in small pots of all sizes. Some damp clothes were
drying inside the chimney-corner. The shovel, tongs, and the nozzle
of the bellows, all of colossal size, shone like polished steel, while
along the walls hung many pots and pans in which the clear flame of the
hearth, mingling with the first rays of the sun coming in through the
window, was mirrored fitfully.

<p/>Charles went up the first floor to see the patient. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
bed, sweating under his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bed-clothes, having thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cotton nightcap
right away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was a fat little man of fifty, with white skin
and blue eyes, the forepart of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head bald, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wore earrings. By
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) side on a chair stood a large decanter of brandy, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) poured
himself a little from time to time to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spirits; but as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) caught sight of the doctor his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) elation subsided, and instead of
swearing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been doing for the last twelve hours, began to groan
freely.

<p/>The fracture was a simple one, without any kind of complication.

<p/>Charles could not have hoped for an easier case. Then calling to mind
the devices of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) masters at the bedsides of patients, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) comforted the
sufferer with all sorts of kindly remarks, those caresses of the surgeon
that are like the oil they put on bistouries. In order to make some
splints a bundle of laths was brought up from the cart-house. Charles
selected one, cut it into two pieces and planed it with a fragment
of windowpane, while the servant tore up sheets to make bandages, and
Mademoiselle Emma tried to sew some pads. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was a long time before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) work-case, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father grew impatient; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not answer,
but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sewed she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fingers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) then put to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
mouth to suck them. Charles was surprised at the whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nails.
They were shiny, delicate at the tips, more polished than the ivory of
Dieppe, and almond-shaped. Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand was not beautiful, perhaps not
white enough, and a little hard at the knuckles; besides, it was too
long, with no soft inflections in the outlines. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) real beauty was in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes. Although brown, they seemed black because of the lashes, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) look came at you frankly, with a candid boldness.

<p/>The bandaging over, the doctor was invited by Monsieur Rouault himself
to <div class="bookquote">``pick a bit''  (<font color='red'><b>Rouault/Monsieur Rouault/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>before he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) left.

<p/>Charles went down into the room on the ground floor. Knives and forks
and silver goblets were laid for two on a little table at the foot of a
huge bed that had a canopy of printed cotton with figures representing
Turks. There was an odour of iris-root and damp sheets that escaped
from a large oak chest opposite the window. On the floor in corners were
sacks of flour stuck upright in rows. These were the overflow from
the neighbouring granary, to which three stone steps led. By way of
decoration for the apartment, hanging to a nail in the middle of the
wall, whose green paint scaled off from the effects of the saltpetre,
was a crayon head of Minerva in gold frame, underneath which was written
in Gothic letters <div class="bookquote">``To dear Papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Minerva</b></font>)</div><p/>First they spoke of the patient, then of the weather, of the great cold,
of the wolves that infested the fields at night.

<p/>Mademoiselle Rouault did not at all like the country, especially now
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) had to look after the farm almost alone. As the room was
chilly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) shivered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) ate. This showed something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) full lips,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) had a habit of biting when silent.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) neck stood out from a white turned-down collar. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) hair, whose
two black folds seemed each of a single piece, so smooth were they, was
parted in the middle by a delicate line that curved slightly with the
curve of the head; and, just showing the tip of the ear, it was joined
behind in a thick chignon, with a wavy movement at the temples that the
country doctor saw now for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) life. The upper part of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) cheek was rose-coloured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) had, like a man, thrust in between two
buttons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) bodice a tortoise-shell eyeglass.

<p/>When Charles, after bidding farewell to old Rouault, returned to the
room before leaving, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) standing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) forehead against the
window, looking into the garden, where the bean props had been knocked
down by the wind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) turned round. <div class="bookquote">``Are you looking for anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My whip, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) began rummaging on the bed, behind the doors, under the chairs. It
had fallen to the floor, between the sacks and the wall. Mademoiselle
Emma saw it, and bent over the flour sacks.

<p/>Charles out of politeness made a dash also, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
arm, at the same moment felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) breast brush against the back of the
young girl bending beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drew herself up, scarlet, and looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whip.

<p/>Instead of returning to the Bertaux in three days as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had promised,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went back the very next day, then regularly twice a week, without
counting the visits he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) paid now and then as if by accident.

<p/>Everything, moreover, went well; the patient progressed favourably; and
when, at the end of forty-six days, old Rouault was seen trying to walk
alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``den,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rouault/Monsieur Rouault/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Monsieur Bovary began to be looked upon as a man
of great capacity. Old Rouault said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) could not have been cured
better by the first doctor of Yvetot, or even of Rouen.

<p/>As to Charles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not stop to ask himself why it was a pleasure
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to go to the Bertaux. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would, no doubt, have
attributed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) zeal to the importance of the case, or perhaps to the
money he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hoped to make by it. Was it for this, however, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) visits
to the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) life? On these days he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) rose early, set off at a gallop, urging on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) horse, then got down to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) boots in the grass and put on black
gloves before entering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) liked going into the courtyard, and noticing
the gate turn against his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shoulder, the cock crow on the wall, the lads
run to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) liked the granary and the stables; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) liked old
Rouault, who pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) hand and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) saviour; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) liked the
small wooden shoes of Mademoiselle Emma on the scoured flags of the
kitchen--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) high heels made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a little taller; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked in
front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>), the wooden soles springing up quickly struck with a sharp
sound against the leather of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) boots.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) always accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) to the first step of the stairs. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>)
horse had not yet been brought round she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stayed there. They had said
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; there was no more talking. The open air wrapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) round,
playing with the soft down on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neck, or blew to and fro
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hips the apron-strings, that fluttered like streamers. Once,
during a thaw the bark of the trees in the yard was oozing, the snow on
the roofs of the outbuildings was melting; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stood on the threshold,
and went to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sunshade and opened it. The sunshade of silk of
the colour of pigeons' breasts, through which the sun shone, lighted
up with shifting hues the white skin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) smiled under the
tender warmth, and drops of water could be heard falling one by one on
the stretched silk.

<p/>During the first period of Charles's visits to the Bertaux, Madame
Bovary junior never failed to inquire after the invalid, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
even chosen in the book that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) kept on a system of double entry a
clean blank page for Monsieur Rouault. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had a
daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to make inquiries, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) learnt the Mademoiselle
Rouault, brought up at the Ursuline Convent, had received what is called
<div class="bookquote">``a good education'' (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Rouault</b></font>)</div>; and so knew dancing, geography, drawing, how to
embroider and play the piano. That was the last straw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is for this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) face beams when he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)
goes to see her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) puts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) new waistcoat at the risk of
spoiling it with the rain. Ah! that woman! That woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) detested her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) instinctively. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) solaced herself by
allusions that Charles did not understand, then by casual observations
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) let pass for fear of a storm, finally by open apostrophes to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew not what to answer. <div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) go back to the Bertaux now
that Monsieur Rouault was cured and that these folks hadn't paid yet?
Ah! it was because a young lady was there, some one who know how to
talk, to embroider, to be witty. That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) cared about; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) wanted
town misses.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The daughter of old Rouault a town miss! Get out! Their grandfather was
a shepherd, and they have a cousin who was almost had up at the assizes
for a nasty blow in a quarrel. It is not worth while making such a fuss,
or showing herself at church on Sundays in a silk gown like a countess.
Besides, the poor old chap, if it hadn't been for the colza last year,
would have had much ado to pay up his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) arrears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For very weariness Charles left off going to the Bertaux. Heloise made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) swear, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand on the prayer-book, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would go there no more
after much sobbing and many kisses, in a great outburst of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
obeyed then, but the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) desire protested against the
servility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) conduct; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought, with a kind of naive
hypocrisy, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) interdict to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a sort of right to
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>). And then the widow was thin; she (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) had long teeth; wore in all
weathers a little black shawl, the edge of which hung down between her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>)
shoulder-blades; her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) bony figure was sheathed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) clothes as if they
were a scabbard; they were too short, and displayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) ankles with the
laces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) large boots crossed over grey stockings.

<p/>Charles's mother came to see them from time to time, but after a few
days the daughter-in-law seemed to put her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) own edge on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>), and
then, like two knives, they scarified him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with their reflections and
observations. It was wrong of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to eat so much.

<p/>Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) always offer a glass of something to everyone who came?
What obstinacy not to wear flannels! In the spring it came about that a
notary at Ingouville, the holder of the widow Dubuc's property, one fine
day went off, taking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dubuc</b></font>) all the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dubuc</b></font>) office. Heloise,
it is true, still possessed, besides a share in a boat valued at six
thousand francs, her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) house in the Rue St. Francois; and yet, with all
this fortune that had been so trumpeted abroad, nothing, excepting
perhaps a little furniture and a few clothes, had appeared in the
household. The matter had to be gone into. The house at Dieppe was found
to be eaten up with mortgages to its foundations; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) had placed
with the notary God only knew, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) share in the boat did not exceed
one thousand crowns. She (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) had lied, the good lady! In his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) exasperation,
Monsieur Bovary the elder, smashing a chair on the flags, accused his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
wife of having caused misfortune to the son by harnessing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to such
a harridan, whose harness wasn't worth her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hide. They came to Tostes.
Explanations followed. There were scenes. Heloise in tears, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>)
arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) husband, implored him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) parents.

<p/>Charles tried to speak up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>). They grew angry and left the house.

<p/>But <div class="bookquote">``the blow had struck home.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A week after, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) was hanging up some
washing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) yard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) was seized with a spitting of blood, and
the next day, while Charles had his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) drawing the
window-curtain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``O God!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>gave a sigh and fainted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) was
dead! What a surprise! When all was over at the cemetery Charles went
home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found no one downstairs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went up to the first floor to
their room; saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) dress still hanging at the foot of the alcove; then,
leaning against the writing-table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stayed until the evening, buried
in a sorrowful reverie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Heloise</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) after all!



<p/>Chapter Three

<p/>One morning old Rouault brought Charles the money for setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
leg--seventy-five francs in forty-sou pieces, and a turkey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had heard
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) loss, and consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) on the shoulder; <div class="bookquote">``I've been
through it. When I lost my dear departed, I went into the fields to be
quite alone. I fell at the foot of a tree; I cried; I called on God; I
talked nonsense to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I wanted to be like the moles that I saw on the
branches, their insides swarming with worms, dead, and an end of it.
And when I thought that there were others at that very moment with their
nice little wives holding them in their embrace, I struck great blows on
the earth with my stick. I was pretty well mad with not eating; the very
idea of going to a cafe disgusted me--you wouldn't believe it. Well,
quite softly, one day following another, a spring on a winter, and an
autumn after a summer, this wore away, piece by piece, crumb by crumb;
it passed away, it is gone, I should say it has sunk; for something
always remains at the bottom as one would say--a weight here, at one's
heart. But since it is the lot of all of us, one must not give way
altogether, and, because others have died, want to die too. You must
pull yourself together, Monsieur Bovary. It will pass away. Come to see
us; my daughter thinks of you now and again, d’ye know, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) says
you are forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Spring will soon be here. We'll have some
rabbit-shooting in the warrens to amuse you a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) advice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went back to the Bertaux. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found all
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had left it, that is to say, as it was five months ago. The pear
trees were already in blossom, and Farmer Rouault, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) legs again,
came and went, making the farm more full of life.

<p/>Thinking it his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) duty to heap the greatest attention upon the doctor
because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) sad position, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) not to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) hat off,
spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) in an undertone as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) had been ill, and even pretended
to be angry because nothing rather lighter had been prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)
than for the others, such as a little clotted cream or stewed pears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)
told stories. Charles found himself laughing, but the remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wife suddenly coming back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) depressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Coffee was brought in;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought no more about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought less of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grew accustomed to living alone. The new
delight of independence soon made his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) loneliness bearable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could now
change his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) meal-times, go in or out without explanation, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
very tired stretch himself at full length on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bed. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) nursed and
coddled himself and accepted the consolations that were offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
On the other hand, the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife had not served him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ill in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
business, since for a month people had been saying, <div class="bookquote">``The poor young
man! what a loss!''  (<font color='red'><b>a month people</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) name had been talked about, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) practice had
increased; and moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could go to the Bertaux just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) liked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had an aimless hope, and was vaguely happy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought himself better
looking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whiskers before the looking-glass.

<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) got there about three o’clock. Everybody was in the fields.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went into the kitchen, but did not at once catch sight of Emma; the
outside shutters were closed. Through the chinks of the wood the sun
sent across the flooring long fine rays that were broken at the corners
of the furniture and trembled along the ceiling. Some flies on the table
were crawling up the glasses that had been used, and buzzing as they
drowned themselves in the dregs of the cider. The daylight that came in
by the chimney made velvet of the soot at the back of the fireplace, and
touched with blue the cold cinders. Between the window and the hearth
Emma was sewing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wore no fichu; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could see small drops of
perspiration on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bare shoulders.

<p/>After the fashion of country folks she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to have something to
drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said no; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) insisted, and at last laughingly offered to have
a glass of liqueur with him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to fetch a bottle of curacao
from the cupboard, reached down two small glasses, filled one to the
brim, poured scarcely anything into the other, and, after having clinked
glasses, carried hers to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth. As it was almost empty she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bent
back to drink, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head thrown back, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips pouting, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neck on the
strain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) laughed at getting none of it, while with the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
tongue passing between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) small teeth she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) licked drop by drop the
bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) glass.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat down again and took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) work, a white cotton stocking she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
darning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) worked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head bent down; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not speak, nor did
Charles. The air coming in under the door blew a little dust over the
flags; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) watched it drift along, and heard nothing but the throbbing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head and the faint clucking of a hen that had laid an egg in the
yard. Emma from time to time cooled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheeks with the palms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
hands, and cooled these again on the knobs of the huge fire-dogs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) complained of suffering since the beginning of the season from
giddiness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked if sea-baths would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) any good; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began
talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convent, Charles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) school; words came to them. They
went up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) old music-books, the little
prizes she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had won, and the oak-leaf crowns, left at the bottom of a
cupboard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), too, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother, of the country, and even
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the bed in the garden where, on the first Friday of every
month, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gathered flowers to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother's tomb. But the
gardener they had never knew anything about it; servants are so stupid!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have dearly liked, if only for the winter, to live in town,
although the length of the fine days made the country perhaps even more
wearisome in the summer. And, according to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was saying, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
voice was clear, sharp, or, on a sudden all languor, drawn out in
modulations that ended almost in murmurs as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke to herself, now
joyous, opening big naive eyes, then with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyelids half closed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
look full of boredom, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts wandering.

<p/>Going home at night, Charles went over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) words one by one, trying to
recall them, to fill out their sense, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might piece out the life
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had lived before he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thoughts
other than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the first time, or as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had just left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked himself what would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would be married,
and to whom! Alas! Old Rouault was rich, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)!--so beautiful! But
Emma's face always rose before his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) eyes, and a monotone, like the
humming of a top, sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) ears, <div class="bookquote">``If you should marry after
all! If you should marry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>At night he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) could not sleep; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) throat was
parched; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) was athirst. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) got up to drink from the water-bottle and
opened the window. The night was covered with stars, a warm wind blowing
in the distance; the dogs were barking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) head towards the
Bertaux.

<p/>Thinking that, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) should lose nothing, Charles promised
himself to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in marriage as soon as occasion offered, but each
time such occasion did offer the fear of not finding the right words
sealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lips.

<p/>Old Rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) daughter, who was
of no use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) in the house. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) excused her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), thinking
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) too clever for farming, a calling under the ban of Heaven, since one
never saw a millionaire in it. Far from having made a fortune by it,
the good man was losing every year; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was good in bargaining, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoyed the dodges of the trade, on the other hand, agriculture
properly so called, and the internal management of the farm, suited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
less than most people. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not willingly take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pockets, and did not spare expense in all that concerned himself, liking
to eat well, to have good fires, and to sleep well. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked old cider,
underdone legs of mutton, glorias* well beaten up. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meals in
the kitchen alone, opposite the fire, on a little table brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
all ready laid as on the stage.

<p/>*A mixture of coffee and spirits.

<p/>When, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived that Charles's cheeks grew red if near his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
daughter, which meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would propose for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) one of these days,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chewed the cud of the matter beforehand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly thought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a
little meagre, and not quite the son-in-law he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have liked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was said to be well brought-up, economical, very learned, and no doubt
would not make too many difficulties about the dowry. Now, as old
Rouault would soon be forced to sell twenty-two acres of <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) property,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rouault/Monsieur Rouault/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) owed a good deal to the mason, to the harness-maker, and as the
shaft of the cider-press wanted renewing, <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the mason</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) said
to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At Michaelmas Charles went to spend three days at the Bertaux.

<p/>The last had passed like the others in procrastinating from hour to
hour. Old Rouault was seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) off; they were walking along the road
full of ruts; they were about to part. This was the time. Charles gave
himself as far as to the corner of the hedge, and at last, when past
it--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Rouault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to say something to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They stopped. Charles was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, tell me your story. Don't I know all about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rouault/Monsieur Rouault/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said old Rouault,
laughing softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Rouault--Monsieur Rouault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>stammered Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask nothing better'' (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>, the farmer went on. <div class="bookquote">``Although, no doubt, the
little one is of my mind, still we must ask her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) opinion. So you get
off--I'll go back home. If it is `yes', you needn't return because of
all the people about, and besides it would upset her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) too much. But so
that you mayn't be eating your heart, I'll open wide the outer shutter
of the window against the wall; you can see it from the back by leaning
over the hedge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went off.

<p/>Charles fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) horse to a tree; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ran into the road and waited.
Half an hour passed, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) counted nineteen minutes by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) watch.
Suddenly a noise was heard against the wall; the shutter had been thrown
back; the hook was still swinging.

<p/>The next day by nine o’clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was at the farm. Emma blushed as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) entered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a little forced laugh to keep herself in
countenance. Old Rouault embraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) future son-in-law. The discussion
of money matters was put off; moreover, there was plenty of time before
them, as the marriage could not decently take place till Charles was out
of mourning, that is to say, about the spring of the next year.

<p/>The winter passed waiting for this. Mademoiselle Rouault was busy with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) trousseau. Part of it was ordered at Rouen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made herself
chemises and nightcaps after fashion-plates that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) borrowed. When
Charles visited the farmer, the preparations for the wedding were talked
over; they wondered in what room they should have dinner; they dreamed
of the number of dishes that would be wanted, and what should be
entrees.

<p/>Emma would, on the contrary, have preferred to have a midnight wedding
with torches, but old Rouault could not understand such an idea. So
there was a wedding at which forty-three persons were present, at which
they remained sixteen hours at table, began again the next day, and to
some extent on the days following.



<p/>Chapter Four

<p/>The guests arrived early in carriages, in one-horse chaises, two-wheeled
cars, old open gigs, waggonettes with leather hoods, and the young
people from the nearer villages in carts, in which they stood up in
rows, holding on to the sides so as not to fall, going at a trot
and well shaken up. Some came from a distance of thirty miles, from
Goderville, from Normanville, and from Cany.

<p/>All the relatives of both families had been invited, quarrels between
friends arranged, acquaintances long since lost sight of written to.

<p/>From time to time one heard the crack of a whip behind the hedge; then
the gates opened, a chaise entered. Galloping up to the foot of the
steps, it stopped short and emptied its load. They got down from all
sides, rubbing knees and stretching arms. The ladies, wearing bonnets,
had on dresses in the town fashion, gold watch chains, pelerines with
the ends tucked into belts, or little coloured fichus fastened down
behind with a pin, and that left the back of the neck bare. The lads,
dressed like their papas, seemed uncomfortable in their new clothes
-LRB-many that day hand-sewed their first pair of boots-RRB-, and by their
sides, speaking never a work, wearing the white dress of their first
communion lengthened for the occasion were some big girls of fourteen or
sixteen, cousins or elder sisters no doubt, rubicund, bewildered, their
hair greasy with rose pomade, and very much afraid of dirtying their
gloves. As there were not enough stable-boys to unharness all the
carriages, the gentlemen turned up their sleeves and set about it
themselves. According to their different social positions they wore
tail-coats, overcoats, shooting jackets, cutaway-coats; fine tail-coats,
redolent of family respectability, that only came out of the wardrobe
on state occasions; overcoats with long tails flapping in the wind and
round capes and pockets like sacks; shooting jackets of coarse
cloth, generally worn with a cap with a brass-bound peak; very short
cutaway-coats with two small buttons in the back, close together like
a pair of eyes, and the tails of which seemed cut out of one piece by a
carpenter's hatchet. Some, too -LRB-but these, you may be sure, would sit at
the bottom of the table-RRB-, wore their best blouses--that is to say,
with collars turned down to the shoulders, the back gathered into small
plaits and the waist fastened very low down with a worked belt.

<p/>And the shirts stood out from the chests like cuirasses! Everyone had
just had his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) hair cut; ears stood out from the heads; they had been
close-shaved; a few, even, who had had to get up before daybreak, and
not been able to see to shave, had diagonal gashes under their noses or
cuts the size of a three-franc piece along the jaws, which the fresh
air en route had enflamed, so that the great white beaming faces were
mottled here and there with red dabs.

<p/>The mairie was a mile and a half from the farm, and they went thither
on foot, returning in the same way after the ceremony in the church.
The procession, first united like one long coloured scarf that undulated
across the fields, along the narrow path winding amid the green corn,
soon lengthened out, and broke up into different groups that loitered to
talk. The fiddler walked in front with his (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) violin, gay with ribbons at
its pegs. Then came the married pair, the relations, the friends, all
following pell-mell; the children stayed behind amusing themselves
plucking the bell-flowers from oat-ears, or playing amongst themselves
unseen. Emma's dress, too long, trailed a little on the ground; from
time to time she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped to pull it up, and then delicately, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
gloved hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) picked off the coarse grass and the thistledowns,
while Charles, empty handed, waited till she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had finished. Old Rouault,
with a new silk hat and the cuffs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) black coat covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) hands
up to the nails, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) arm to Madame Bovary senior. As to Monsieur
Bovary senior, who, heartily despising all these folk, had come simply
in a frock-coat of military cut with one row of buttons--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) was passing
compliments of the bar to a fair young peasant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bowed, blushed,
and did not know what to say. The other wedding guests talked of their
business or played tricks behind each other's backs, egging one another
on in advance to be jolly. Those who listened could always catch the
squeaking of the fiddler, who went on playing across the fields. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) saw that the rest were far behind he (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) stopped to take breath, slowly
rosined his (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) bow, so that the strings should sound more shrilly, then set
off again, by turns lowering and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) neck, the better to mark
time for himself. The noise of the instrument drove away the little
birds from afar.

<p/>The table was laid under the cart-shed. On it were four sirloins, six
chicken fricassees, stewed veal, three legs of mutton, and in the middle
a fine roast suckling pig, flanked by four chitterlings with sorrel. At
the corners were decanters of brandy. Sweet bottled-cider frothed round
the corks, and all the glasses had been filled to the brim with wine
beforehand. Large dishes of yellow cream, that trembled with the least
shake of the table, had designed on their smooth surface the initials of
the newly wedded pair in nonpareil arabesques. A confectioner of Yvetot
had been intrusted with the tarts and sweets. As he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had only just set up
on the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had taken a lot of trouble, and at dessert he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) himself
brought in a set dish that evoked loud cries of wonderment. To begin
with, at its base there was a square of blue cardboard, representing a
temple with porticoes, colonnades, and stucco statuettes all round, and
in the niches constellations of gilt paper stars; then on the second
stage was a dungeon of Savoy cake, surrounded by many fortifications
in candied angelica, almonds, raisins, and quarters of oranges; and
finally, on the upper platform a green field with rocks set in lakes of
jam, nutshell boats, and a small Cupid balancing himself in a chocolate
swing whose two uprights ended in real roses for balls at the top.

<p/>Until night they ate. When any of them were too tired of sitting, they
went out for a stroll in the yard, or for a game with corks in the
granary, and then returned to table. Some towards the finish went to
sleep and snored. But with the coffee everyone woke up. Then they began
songs, showed off tricks, raised heavy weights, performed feats with
their fingers, then tried lifting carts on their shoulders, made broad
jokes, kissed the women. At night when they left, the horses, stuffed
up to the nostrils with oats, could hardly be got into the shafts; they
kicked, reared, the harness broke, their masters laughed or swore;
and all night in the light of the moon along country roads there were
runaway carts at full gallop plunging into the ditches, jumping over
yard after yard of stones, clambering up the hills, with women leaning
out from the tilt to catch hold of the reins.

<p/>Those who stayed at the Bertaux spent the night drinking in the kitchen.
The children had fallen asleep under the seats.

<p/>The bride had begged her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) father to be spared the usual marriage
pleasantries. However, a fishmonger, one of their cousins -LRB-who had even
brought a pair of soles for his (<font color='blue'><b>fishmonger</b></font>) wedding present-RRB-, began to squirt water
from his (<font color='blue'><b>fishmonger</b></font>) mouth through the keyhole, when old Rouault came up just in
time to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>), and explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) that the distinguished position
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) son-in-law would not allow of such liberties. The cousin all the
same did not give in to these reasons readily. In his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) accused
old Rouault of being proud, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) joined four or five other guests in
a corner, who having, through mere chance, been several times running
served with the worst helps of meat, also were of opinion they had been
badly used, and were whispering about their host, and with covered hints
hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would ruin himself.

<p/>Madame Bovary, senior, had not opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) mouth all day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had been
consulted neither as to the dress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) daughter-in-law nor as to the
arrangement of the feast; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) went to bed early. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) husband, instead
of following her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>), sent to Saint-Victor for some cigars, and smoked till
daybreak, drinking kirsch-punch, a mixture unknown to the company. This
added greatly to the consideration in which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was held.

<p/>Charles, who was not of a facetious turn, did not shine at the wedding.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) answered feebly to the puns, doubles entendres*, compliments, and
chaff that it was felt a duty to let off at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as soon as the soup
appeared.

<p/>*Double meanings.

<p/>The next day, on the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) seemed another man. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) who
might rather have been taken for the virgin of the evening before,
whilst the bride gave no sign that revealed anything. The shrewdest did
not know what to make of it, and they looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) passed
near them with an unbounded concentration of mind. But Charles concealed
nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``my wife'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>, tutoyed* her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) of
everyone, looked for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) everywhere, and often he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) into the
yards, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could be seen from far between the trees, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) waist, and walking half-bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), ruffling the
chemisette of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) bodice with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head.

<p/>*Used the familiar form of address.

<p/>Two days after the wedding the married pair left. Charles, on account of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) patients, could not be away longer. Old Rouault had them driven back
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) cart, and himself accompanied them as far as Vassonville. Here
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) embraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) daughter for the last time, got down, and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) way.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had gone about a hundred paces he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) stopped, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) saw the
cart disappearing, its wheels turning in the dust, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) gave a deep sigh.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) wedding, the old times, the first pregnancy of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>), too, had been very happy the day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) home, and had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) off on a pillion,
trotting through the snow, for it was near Christmas-time, and the
country was all white. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) by one arm, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) basket hanging from
the other; the wind blew the long lace of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Cauchois headdress so that
it sometimes flapped across his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) mouth, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>)
saw near him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) shoulder, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little rosy face, smiling silently
under the gold bands of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cap. To warm her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put them from
time to time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) breast. How long ago it all was! Their son would
have been thirty by now. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) looked back and saw nothing on the
road. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt dreary as an empty house; and tender memories mingling
with the sad thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brain, addled by the fumes of the feast, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
felt inclined for a moment to take a turn towards the church. As he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
afraid, however, that this sight would make him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) yet more sad, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went
right away home.

<p/>Monsieur and Madame Charles arrived at Tostes about six o’clock.

<p/>The neighbors came to the windows to see their doctor's new wife.

<p/>The old servant presented herself, curtsied to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), apologised for not
having dinner ready, and suggested that madame, in the meantime, should
look over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) house.



<p/>Chapter Five

<p/>The brick front was just in a line with the street, or rather the road.
Behind the door hung a cloak with a small collar, a bridle, and a black
leather cap, and on the floor, in a corner, were a pair of leggings,
still covered with dry mud. On the right was the one apartment, that was
both dining and sitting room. A canary yellow paper, relieved at the
top by a garland of pale flowers, was puckered everywhere over the badly
stretched canvas; white calico curtains with a red border hung crossways
at the length of the window; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with
a head of Hippocrates shone resplendent between two plate candlesticks
under oval shades. On the other side of the passage was Charles's
consulting room, a little room about six paces wide, with a table,
three chairs, and an office chair. Volumes of the <div class="bookquote">``Dictionary of Medical
Science,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>uncut, but the binding rather the worse for the successive
sales through which they had gone, occupied almost along the six shelves
of a deal bookcase.

<p/>The smell of melted butter penetrated through the walls when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw
patients, just as in the kitchen one could hear the people coughing in
the consulting room and recounting their histories.

<p/>Then, opening on the yard, where the stable was, came a large
dilapidated room with a stove, now used as a wood-house, cellar, and
pantry, full of old rubbish, of empty casks, agricultural implements
past service, and a mass of dusty things whose use it was impossible to
guess.

<p/>The garden, longer than wide, ran between two mud walls with espaliered
apricots, to a hawthorn hedge that separated it from the field. In the
middle was a slate sundial on a brick pedestal; four flower beds with
eglantines surrounded symmetrically the more useful kitchen garden bed.
Right at the bottom, under the spruce bushes, was a cure in plaster
reading his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breviary.

<p/>Emma went upstairs. The first room was not furnished, but in the second,
which was their bedroom, was a mahogany bedstead in an alcove with red
drapery. A shell box adorned the chest of drawers, and on the secretary
near the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin
ribbons stood in a bottle. It was a bride's bouquet; it was the other
one's. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) looked at it. Charles noticed it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took it and carried it
up to the attic, while Emma seated in an arm-chair -LRB-they were putting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) things down around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)-RRB- thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bridal flowers packed up in
a bandbox, and wondered, dreaming, what would be done with them if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
were to die.

<p/>During the first days she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) occupied herself in thinking about changes in
the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took the shades off the candlesticks, had new wallpaper
put up, the staircase repainted, and seats made in the garden round the
sundial; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even inquired how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could get a basin with a jet fountain
and fishes. Finally her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband, knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked to drive out,
picked up a second-hand dogcart, which, with new lamps and splashboard
in striped leather, looked almost like a tilbury.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was happy then, and without a care in the world. A meal together,
a walk in the evening on the highroad, a gesture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
hair, the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) straw hat hanging from the window-fastener, and
many another thing in which Charles had never dreamed of pleasure, now
made up the endless round of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) happiness. In bed, in the morning, by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side, on the pillow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) watched the sunlight sinking into the down
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fair cheek, half hidden by the lappets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) night-cap. Seen
thus closely, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes looked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enlarged, especially when, on
waking up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opened and shut them rapidly many times. Black in the
shade, dark blue in broad daylight, they had, as it were, depths of
different colours, that, darker in the centre, grew paler towards the
surface of the eye. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own eyes lost themselves in these depths; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw
himself in miniature down to the shoulders, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) handkerchief round
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head and the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shirt open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) rose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) came to the window
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) off, and stayed leaning on the sill between two pots of
geranium, clad in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dressing gown hanging loosely about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Charles,
in the street buckled his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spurs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) foot on the mounting stone, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) from above, picking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth some scrap of
flower or leaf that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) blew out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Then this, eddying, floating,
described semicircles in the air like a bird, and was caught before
it reached the ground in the ill-groomed mane of the old white mare
standing motionless at the door. Charles from horseback threw her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) a
kiss; she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) answered with a nod; she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) shut the window, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) set off. And
then along the highroad, spreading out its long ribbon of dust, along
the deep lanes that the trees bent over as in arbours, along paths where
the corn reached to the knees, with the sun on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back and the morning
air in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) nostrils, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heart full of the joys of the past night, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
mind at rest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) flesh at ease, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went on, re-chewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) happiness,
like those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are
digesting.

<p/>Until now what good had he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) life? His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) time at school, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) remained shut up within the high walls, alone, in the midst of
companions richer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) or cleverer at their work, who laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
accent, who jeered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) clothes, and whose mothers came to the school
with cakes in their muffs? Later on, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) studied medicine, and never
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) purse full enough to treat some little work-girl who would have
become his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mistress? Afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had lived fourteen months with the
widow, whose feet in bed were cold as icicles. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had for life
this beautiful woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) adored. For him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the universe did not extend
beyond the circumference of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) petticoat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reproached himself
with not loving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) turned back quickly,
ran up the stairs with a beating heart. Emma, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room, was dressing;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came up on tiptoe, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a cry.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not keep from constantly touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) comb, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ring, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
fichu; sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) great sounding kisses with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mouth on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheeks, or else little kisses in a row all along her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bare arm
from the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fingers up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) away
half-smiling, half-vexed, as you do a child who hangs about you.

<p/>Before marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought herself in love; but the happiness that
should have followed this love not having come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought,
have been mistaken. And Emma tried to find out what one meant exactly in
life by the words felicity, passion, rapture, that had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so
beautiful in books.



<p/>Chapter Six

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had read <div class="bookquote">``Paul and Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had dreamed of the little
bamboo-house, the nigger Domingo, the dog Fidele, but above all of the
sweet friendship of some dear little brother, who seeks red fruit for
you on trees taller than steeples, or who runs barefoot over the sand,
bringing you a bird's nest.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was thirteen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father himself took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to town to place
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the convent. They stopped at an inn in the St. Gervais quarter,
where, at their supper, they used painted plates that set forth the
story of Mademoiselle de la Valliere. The explanatory legends, chipped
here and there by the scratching of knives, all glorified religion, the
tendernesses of the heart, and the pomps of court.

<p/>Far from being bored at first at the convent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) took pleasure in the
society of the good sisters, who, to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>), took her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) to the chapel,
which one entered from the refectory by a long corridor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) played very
little during recreation hours, knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) catechism well, and it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>)
who always answered Monsieur le Vicaire's difficult questions. Living
thus, without ever leaving the warm atmosphere of the classrooms, and
amid these pale-faced women wearing rosaries with brass crosses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>)
was softly lulled by the mystic languor exhaled in the perfumes of the
altar, the freshness of the holy water, and the lights of the tapers.
Instead of attending to mass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) looked at the pious vignettes with
their azure borders in her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) book, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) loved the sick lamb, the sacred
heart pierced with sharp arrows, or the poor Jesus sinking beneath the
cross he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) carries. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) tried, by way of mortification, to eat nothing a
whole day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) head to find some vow to fulfil.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) went to confession, she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) invented little sins in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>)
might stay there longer, kneeling in the shadow, her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) hands joined,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) face against the grating beneath the whispering of the priest.
The comparisons of betrothed, husband, celestial lover, and eternal
marriage, that recur in sermons, stirred within her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) soul depths of
unexpected sweetness.

<p/>In the evening, before prayers, there was some religious reading in
the study. On week-nights it was some abstract of sacred history or
the Lectures of the Abbe Frayssinous, and on Sundays passages from the
<div class="bookquote">``Genie du Christianisme,''  (<font color='red'><b>Abbe</b></font>)</div>as a recreation. How she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) listened at first to
the sonorous lamentations of its romantic melancholies reechoing
through the world and eternity! If her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) childhood had been spent in the
shop-parlour of some business quarter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) might perhaps have opened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) heart to those lyrical invasions of Nature, which usually come to
us only through translation in books. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) knew the country too well;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) knew the lowing of cattle, the milking, the ploughs.

<p/>Accustomed to calm aspects of life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) turned, on the contrary, to
those of excitement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) loved the sea only for the sake of its storms,
and the green fields only when broken up by ruins.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) wanted to get some personal profit out of things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) rejected
as useless all that did not contribute to the immediate desires of her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>)
heart, being of a temperament more sentimental than artistic, looking
for emotions, not landscapes.

<p/>At the convent there was an old maid who came for a week each month to
mend the linen. Patronized by the clergy, because she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) belonged to an
ancient family of noblemen ruined by the Revolution, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) dined in the
refectory at the table of the good sisters, and after the meal had a bit
of chat with them before going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) work. The girls often slipped
out from the study to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) knew by heart the love songs
of the last century, and sang them in a low voice as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) stitched away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) told stories, gave them news, went errands in the town, and on
the sly lent the big girls some novel, that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) always carried in the
pockets of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) apron, and of which the good lady herself swallowed
long chapters in the intervals of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) work. They were all love, lovers,
sweethearts, persecuted ladies fainting in lonely pavilions, postilions
killed at every stage, horses ridden to death on every page, sombre
forests, heartaches, vows, sobs, tears and kisses, little skiffs by
moonlight, nightingales in shady groves, <div class="bookquote">``gentlemen''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>brave as lions,
gentle as lambs, virtuous as no one ever was, always well dressed, and
weeping like fountains. For six months, then, Emma, at fifteen years of
age, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands dirty with books from old lending libraries.

<p/>Through Walter Scott, later on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell in love with historical events,
dreamed of old chests, guard-rooms and minstrels. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have liked
to live in some old manor-house, like those long-waisted chatelaines
who, in the shade of pointed arches, spent their days leaning on the
stone, chin in hand, watching a cavalier with white plume galloping on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) black horse from the distant fields. At this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a cult
for Mary Stuart and enthusiastic veneration for illustrious or unhappy
women. Joan of Arc, Heloise, Agnes Sorel, the beautiful Ferroniere, and
Clemence Isaure stood out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) like comets in the dark immensity of
heaven, where also were seen, lost in shadow, and all unconnected, St.
Louis with his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) oak, the dying Bayard, some cruelties of Louis XI, a
little of St. Bartholomew's Day, the plume of the Bearnais, and always
the remembrance of the plates painted in honour of Louis XIV.

<p/>In the music class, in the ballads she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) sang, there was nothing but
little angels with golden wings, madonnas, lagunes, gondoliers;-mild
compositions that allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) to catch a glimpse athwart the obscurity
of style and the weakness of the music of the attractive phantasmagoria
of sentimental realities. Some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) companions brought <div class="bookquote">``keepsakes''
 (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>given them as new year's gifts to the convent. These had to be hidden;
it was quite an undertaking; they were read in the dormitory. Delicately
handling the beautiful satin bindings, Emma looked with dazzled eyes at
the names of the unknown authors, who had signed their verses for the
most part as counts or viscounts.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) blew back the tissue paper over the engraving and
saw it folded in two and fall gently against the page. Here behind the
balustrade of a balcony was a young man in a short cloak, holding in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
arms a young girl in a white dress wearing an alms-bag at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) belt; or
there were nameless portraits of English ladies with fair curls, who
looked at you from under their round straw hats with their large clear
eyes. Some there were lounging in their carriages, gliding through
parks, a greyhound bounding along in front of the equipage driven at
a trot by two midget postilions in white breeches. Others, dreaming on
sofas with an open letter, gazed at the moon through a slightly open
window half draped by a black curtain. The naive ones, a tear on their
cheeks, were kissing doves through the bars of a Gothic cage, or,
smiling, their heads on one side, were plucking the leaves of a
marguerite with their taper fingers, that curved at the tips like peaked
shoes. And you, too, were there, Sultans with long pipes reclining
beneath arbours in the arms of Bayaderes; Djiaours, Turkish sabres,
Greek caps; and you especially, pale landscapes of dithyrambic lands,
that often show us at once palm trees and firs, tigers on the right, a
lion to the left, Tartar minarets on the horizon; the whole framed by
a very neat virgin forest, and with a great perpendicular sunbeam
trembling in the water, where, standing out in relief like white
excoriations on a steel-grey ground, swans are swimming about.

<p/>And the shade of the argand lamp fastened to the wall above Emma's head
lighted up all these pictures of the world, that passed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) one
by one in the silence of the dormitory, and to the distant noise of some
belated carriage rolling over the Boulevards.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother died she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried much the first few days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a
funeral picture made with the hair of the deceased, and, in a letter
sent to the Bertaux full of sad reflections on life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked to be
buried later on in the same grave. The goodman thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be ill,
and came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Emma was secretly pleased that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had reached at
a first attempt the rare ideal of pale lives, never attained by mediocre
hearts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let herself glide along with Lamartine meanderings, listened
to harps on lakes, to all the songs of dying swans, to the falling of
the leaves, the pure virgins ascending to heaven, and the voice of
the Eternal discoursing down the valleys. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wearied of it, would not
confess it, continued from habit, and at last was surprised to feel
herself soothed, and with no more sadness at heart than wrinkles on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
brow.

<p/>The good nuns, who had been so sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) vocation, perceived with
great astonishment that Mademoiselle Rouault seemed to be slipping
from them. They had indeed been so lavish to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of prayers, retreats,
novenas, and sermons, they had so often preached the respect due to
saints and martyrs, and given so much good advice as to the modesty of
the body and the salvation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did as tightly reined
horses; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pulled up short and the bit slipped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) teeth. This
nature, positive in the midst of its enthusiasms, that had loved the
church for the sake of the flowers, and music for the words of the
songs, and literature for its passional stimulus, rebelled against
the mysteries of faith as it grew irritated by discipline, a thing
antipathetic to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) constitution. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from school,
no one was sorry to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) go. The Lady Superior even thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had latterly been somewhat irreverent to the community.

<p/>Emma, at home once more, first took pleasure in looking after the
servants, then grew disgusted with the country and missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convent.
When Charles came to the Bertaux for the first time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought herself
quite disillusioned, with nothing more to learn, and nothing more to
feel.

<p/>But the uneasiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) new position, or perhaps the disturbance
caused by the presence of this man, had sufficed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believe
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at last felt that wondrous passion which, till then, like a
great bird with rose-coloured wings, hung in the splendour of the skies
of poesy; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not think that the calm in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lived
was the happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had dreamed.



<p/>Chapter Seven

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, sometimes, that, after all, this was the happiest time
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life--the honeymoon, as people called it. To taste the full
sweetness of it, it would have been necessary doubtless to fly to those
lands with sonorous names where the days after marriage are full of
laziness most suave. In post chaises behind blue silken curtains to ride
slowly up steep road, listening to the song of the postilion re-echoed
by the mountains, along with the bells of goats and the muffled sound of
a waterfall; at sunset on the shores of gulfs to breathe in the perfume
of lemon trees; then in the evening on the villa-terraces above, hand in
hand to look at the stars, making plans for the future. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
that certain places on earth must bring happiness, as a plant peculiar
to the soil, and that cannot thrive elsewhere. Why could not she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) lean
over balconies in Swiss chalets, or enshrine her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) melancholy in a Scotch
cottage, with a husband dressed in a black velvet coat with long tails,
and thin shoes, a pointed hat and frills? Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would have liked
to confide all these things to someone. But how tell an undefinable
uneasiness, variable as the clouds, unstable as the winds? Words failed
her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)--the opportunity, the courage.

<p/>If Charles had but wished it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had guessed it, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) look had but
once met her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thought, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) that a sudden plenty would have
gone out from her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) heart, as the fruit falls from a tree when shaken by
a hand. But as the intimacy of their life became deeper, the greater
became the gulf that separated her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>Charles's conversation was commonplace as a street pavement, and
everyone's ideas trooped through it in their everyday garb, without
exciting emotion, laughter, or thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had never had the curiosity,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lived at Rouen, to go to the theatre to see the actors
from Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could neither swim, nor fence, nor shoot, and one day
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not explain some term of horsemanship to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had come
across in a novel.

<p/>A man, on the contrary, should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not know everything, excel in manifold
activities, initiate you into the energies of passion, the refinements
of life, all mysteries? But this one taught nothing, knew nothing,
wished nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) happy; and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) resented this easy calm,
this serene heaviness, the very happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would draw; and it was great amusement to Charles to stand
there bolt upright and watch her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) bend over her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) cardboard, with eyes
half-closed the better to see her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) work, or rolling, between her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) fingers,
little bread-pellets. As to the piano, the more quickly her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) fingers
glided over it the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wondered. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) struck the notes with aplomb,
and ran from top to bottom of the keyboard without a break. Thus shaken
up, the old instrument, whose strings buzzed, could be heard at the
other end of the village when the window was open, and often the
bailiff's clerk, passing along the highroad bare-headed and in list
slippers, stopped to listen, his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) sheet of paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Emma, on the other hand, knew how to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sent the
patients' accounts in well-phrased letters that had no suggestion of
a bill. When they had a neighbour to dinner on Sundays, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) managed to
have some tasty dish--piled up pyramids of greengages on vine leaves,
served up preserves turned out into plates--and even spoke of buying
finger-glasses for dessert. From all this much consideration was
extended to Bovary.

<p/>Charles finished by rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own esteem for possessing such a wife.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) showed with pride in the sitting room two small pencil sketches by
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had had framed in very large frames, and hung up against the
wallpaper by long green cords. People returning from mass saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wool-work slippers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came home late--at ten o’clock, at midnight sometimes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked
for something to eat, and as the servant had gone to bed, Emma waited
on him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) coat to dine more at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), one
after the other, the people he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had met, the villages where he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had been,
the prescriptions he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had written, and, well pleased with himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
finished the remainder of the boiled beef and onions, picked pieces off
the cheese, munched an apple, emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) water-bottle, and then went to
bed, and lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) back and snored.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had been for a time accustomed to wear nightcaps, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) handkerchief
would not keep down over his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ears, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hair in the morning was
all tumbled pell-mell about his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) face and whitened with the feathers of
the pillow, whose strings came untied during the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) always wore
thick boots that had two long creases over the instep running obliquely
towards the ankle, while the rest of the upper continued in a straight
line as if stretched on a wooden foot. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said that <div class="bookquote">``was quite good
enough for the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mother approved of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) economy, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) as formerly
when there had been some violent row at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) place; and yet Madame Bovary
senior seemed prejudiced against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter-in-law. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Genie</b></font>)
ways too fine for their position'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>; the wood, the sugar, and the candles
disappeared as <div class="bookquote">``at a grand establishment,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and the amount of firing in
the kitchen would have been enough for twenty-five courses. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
linen in order for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in the presses, and taught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to keep an eye on
the butcher when he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) brought the meat. Emma put up with these lessons.
Madame Bovary was lavish of them; and the words <div class="bookquote">``daughter''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``mother''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>were exchanged all day long, accompanied by little quiverings of the
lips, each one uttering gentle words in a voice trembling with anger.

<p/>In Madame Dubuc's time the old woman felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was still the
favorite; but now the love of Charles for Emma seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a desertion
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tenderness, an encroachment upon what was hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) watched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) son's happiness in sad silence, as a ruined man looks through
the windows at people dining in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recalled to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as
remembrances her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) troubles and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sacrifices, and, comparing these with
Emma's negligence, came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable to
adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so exclusively.

<p/>Charles knew not what to answer: he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) respected his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) loved
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife infinitely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) considered the judgment of the one infallible,
and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought the conduct of the other irreproachable. When Madam
Bovary had gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tried timidly and in the same terms to hazard one or
two of the more anodyne observations he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mamma. Emma
proved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with a word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was mistaken, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
patients.

<p/>And yet, in accord with theories she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to make
herself in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). By moonlight in the garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recited all
the passionate rhymes she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew by heart, and, sighing, sang to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) many
melancholy adagios; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found herself as calm after as before, and
Charles seemed no more amorous and no more moved.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had thus for a while struck the flint on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart without
getting a spark, incapable, moreover, of understanding what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did
not experience as of believing anything that did not present itself
in conventional forms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) persuaded herself without difficulty that
Charles's passion was nothing very exorbitant. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) outbursts became
regular; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at certain fixed times. It was one habit among
other habits, and, like a dessert, looked forward to after the monotony
of dinner.

<p/>A gamekeeper, cured by the doctor of inflammation of the lungs, had
given madame a little Italian greyhound; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out walking, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went out sometimes in order to be alone for a moment, and not to see
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes the eternal garden and the dusty road. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went as far
as the beeches of Banneville, near the deserted pavilion which forms an
angle of the wall on the side of the country. Amidst the vegetation of
the ditch there are long reeds with leaves that cut you.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began by looking round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to see if nothing had changed since last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found again in the same places the foxgloves and
wallflowers, the beds of nettles growing round the big stones, and
the patches of lichen along the three windows, whose shutters, always
closed, were rotting away on their rusty iron bars. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts,
aimless at first, wandered at random, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) greyhound, who ran round
and round in the fields, yelping after the yellow butterflies, chasing
the shrew-mice, or nibbling the poppies on the edge of a cornfield.

<p/>Then gradually her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ideas took definite shape, and, sitting on the grass
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dug up with little prods of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sunshade, Emma repeated to
herself, <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! Why did I marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked herself if by some other chance combination it would have not
been possible to meet another man; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to imagine what would
have been these unrealised events, this different life, this unknown
husband. All, surely, could not be like this one. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might have been
handsome, witty, distinguished, attractive, such as, no doubt, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) old
companions of the convent had married. What were they doing now? In
town, with the noise of the streets, the buzz of the theatres and the
lights of the ballroom, they were living lives where the heart expands,
the senses bourgeon out. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life was cold as a garret whose
dormer window looks on the north, and ennui, the silent spider, was
weaving its web in the darkness in every corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recalled the prize days, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mounted the platform to receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) little crowns, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair in long plaits. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) white frock and
open prunella shoes she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a pretty way, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
seat, the gentlemen bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); the courtyard was
full of carriages; farewells were called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) through their windows;
the music master with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) violin case bowed in passing by. How far all
of this! How far away! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) called Djali, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knees, and
smoothed the long delicate head, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Come, kiss mistress; you have
no troubles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Djali</b></font>)</div><p/>Then noting the melancholy face of the graceful animal, who yawned
slowly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) softened, and comparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to herself, spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aloud
as to somebody in trouble whom one is consoling.

<p/>Occasionally there came gusts of winds, breezes from the sea rolling in
one sweep over the whole plateau of the Caux country, which brought
even to these fields a salt freshness. The rushes, close to the ground,
whistled; the branches trembled in a swift rustling, while their
summits, ceaselessly swaying, kept up a deep murmur. Emma drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shawl
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulders and rose.

<p/>In the avenue a green light dimmed by the leaves lit up the short moss
that crackled softly beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feet. The sun was setting; the sky
showed red between the branches, and the trunks of the trees, uniform,
and planted in a straight line, seemed a brown colonnade standing out
against a background of gold. A fear took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) called Djali,
and hurriedly returned to Tostes by the high road, threw herself into an
armchair, and for the rest of the evening did not speak.

<p/>But towards the end of September something extraordinary fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
life; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was invited by the Marquis d’Andervilliers to Vaubyessard.

<p/>Secretary of State under the Restoration, the Marquis, anxious to
re-enter political life, set about preparing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) candidature to
the Chamber of Deputies long beforehand. In the winter he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) distributed a
great deal of wood, and in the Conseil General always enthusiastically
demanded new roads for his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) arrondissement. During the dog-days he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had
suffered from an abscess, which Charles had cured as if by miracle by
giving a timely little touch with the lancet. The steward sent to Tostes
to pay for the operation reported in the evening that he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) had seen some
superb cherries in the doctor's little garden. Now cherry trees did not
thrive at Vaubyessard; the Marquis asked Bovary for some slips; made it
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) business to thank his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) personally; saw Emma; thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a pretty
figure, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not bow like a peasant; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) did not
think he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was going beyond the bounds of condescension, nor, on the other
hand, making a mistake, in inviting the young couple.

<p/>On Wednesday at three o’clock, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, seated in
their dog-cart, set out for Vaubyessard, with a great trunk strapped
on behind and a bonnet-box in front of the apron. Besides these Charles
held a bandbox between his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knees.

<p/>They arrived at nightfall, just as the lamps in the park were being lit
to show the way for the carriages.



<p/>Chapter Eight

<p/>The chateau, a modern building in Italian style, with two projecting
wings and three flights of steps, lay at the foot of an immense
green-sward, on which some cows were grazing among groups of large trees
set out at regular intervals, while large beds of arbutus, rhododendron,
syringas, and guelder roses bulged out their irregular clusters of
green along the curve of the gravel path. A river flowed under a bridge;
through the mist one could distinguish buildings with thatched roofs
scattered over the field bordered by two gently sloping, well timbered
hillocks, and in the background amid the trees rose in two parallel
lines the coach houses and stables, all that was left of the ruined old
chateau.

<p/>Charles's dog-cart pulled up before the middle flight of steps; servants
appeared; the Marquis came forward, and, offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) arm to the
doctor's wife, conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to the vestibule.

<p/>It was paved with marble slabs, was very lofty, and the sound of
footsteps and that of voices re-echoed through it as in a church.

<p/>Opposite rose a straight staircase, and on the left a gallery
overlooking the garden led to the billiard room, through whose door one
could hear the click of the ivory balls. As she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crossed it to go to the
drawing room, Emma saw standing round the table men with grave faces,
their chins resting on high cravats. They all wore orders, and smiled
silently as they made their strokes.

<p/>On the dark wainscoting of the walls large gold frames bore at
the bottom names written in black letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) read: <div class="bookquote">``Jean-Antoine
d’Andervilliers d’Yvervonbille, Count de la Vaubyessard and Baron de la
Fresnay, killed at the battle of Coutras on the 20th of October,
1587.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And on another: <div class="bookquote">``Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy d’Andervilliers de
la Vaubyessard, Admiral of France and Chevalier of the Order of St.
Michael, wounded at the battle of the Hougue-Saint-Vaast on the 29th of
May, 1692; died at Vaubyessard on the 23rd of January 1693.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>One could
hardly make out those that followed, for the light of the lamps lowered
over the green cloth threw a dim shadow round the room. Burnishing the
horizontal pictures, it broke up against these in delicate lines where
there were cracks in the varnish, and from all these great black squares
framed in with gold stood out here and there some lighter portion of the
painting--a pale brow, two eyes that looked at you, perukes flowing over
and powdering red-coated shoulders, or the buckle of a garter above a
well-rounded calf.

<p/>The Marquis opened the drawing room door; one of the ladies -LRB-the
Marchioness herself-RRB- came to meet Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sit down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) on
an ottoman, and began talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as amicably as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was a woman of about forty, with fine shoulders, a hook
nose, a drawling voice, and on this evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wore over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brown hair
a simple guipure fichu that fell in a point at the back. A fair young
woman sat in a high-backed chair in a corner; and gentlemen with flowers
in their buttonholes were talking to ladies round the fire.

<p/>At seven dinner was served. The men, who were in the majority, sat down
at the first table in the vestibule; the ladies at the second in the
dining room with the Marquis and Marchioness.

<p/>Emma, on entering, felt herself wrapped round by the warm air, a
blending of the perfume of flowers and of the fine linen, of the fumes
of the viands, and the odour of the truffles. The silver dish covers
reflected the lighted wax candles in the candelabra, the cut crystal
covered with light steam reflected from one to the other pale rays;
bouquets were placed in a row the whole length of the table; and in
the large-bordered plates each napkin, arranged after the fashion of a
bishop's mitre, held between its two gaping folds a small oval shaped
roll. The red claws of lobsters hung over the dishes; rich fruit in open
baskets was piled up on moss; there were quails in their plumage; smoke
was rising; and in silk stockings, knee-breeches, white cravat, and
frilled shirt, the steward, grave as a judge, offering ready carved
dishes between the shoulders of the guests, with a touch of the spoon
gave you the piece chosen. On the large stove of porcelain inlaid
with copper baguettes the statue of a woman, draped to the chin, gazed
motionless on the room full of life.

<p/>Madame Bovary noticed that many ladies had not put their gloves in their
glasses.

<p/>But at the upper end of the table, alone amongst all these women, bent
over his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) full plate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) napkin tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) neck like a child, an
old man sat eating, letting drops of gravy drip from his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) mouth. His (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) eyes
were bloodshot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) wore a little queue tied with black ribbon. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
was the Marquis's father-in-law, the old Duke de Laverdiere, once on
a time favourite of the Count d’Artois, in the days of the Vaudreuil
hunting-parties at the Marquis de Conflans', and had been, it was said,
the lover of Queen Marie Antoinette, between Monsieur de Coigny and
Monsieur de Lauzun. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had lived a life of noisy debauch, full of duels,
bets, elopements; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had squandered his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fortune and frightened all his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
family. A servant behind his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) chair named aloud to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) ear the
dishes that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) pointed to stammering, and constantly Emma's eyes
turned involuntarily to this old man with hanging lips, as to something
extraordinary. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lived at court and slept in the bed of queens!
Iced champagne was poured out. Emma shivered all over as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt
it cold in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never seen pomegranates nor tasted
pineapples. The powdered sugar even seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whiter and finer than
elsewhere.

<p/>The ladies afterwards went to their rooms to prepare for the ball.

<p/>Emma made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) toilet with the fastidious care of an actress on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
debut. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair according to the directions of the hairdresser,
and put on the barege dress spread out upon the bed.

<p/>Charles's trousers were tight across the belly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My trouser-straps will be rather awkward for dancing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dancing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>repeated Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you must be mad! They would make fun of you; keep your place.
Besides, it is more becoming for a doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added.

<p/>Charles was silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) walked up and down waiting for Emma to finish
dressing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from behind in the glass between two lights. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) black eyes
seemed blacker than ever. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair, undulating towards the ears, shone
with a blue lustre; a rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chignon trembled on its mobile stalk,
with artificial dewdrops on the tip of the leaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wore a gown of
pale saffron trimmed with three bouquets of pompon roses mixed with
green.

<p/>Charles came and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you are tumbling me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>One could hear the flourish of the violin and the notes of a horn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
went downstairs restraining herself from running.

<p/>Dancing had begun. Guests were arriving. There was some crushing.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat down on a form near the door.

<p/>The quadrille over, the floor was occupied by groups of men standing up
and talking and servants in livery bearing large trays. Along the line
of seated women painted fans were fluttering, bouquets half hid smiling
faces, and gold stoppered scent-bottles were turned in partly-closed
hands, whose white gloves outlined the nails and tightened on the flesh
at the wrists. Lace trimmings, diamond brooches, medallion bracelets
trembled on bodices, gleamed on breasts, clinked on bare arms.

<p/>The hair, well-smoothed over the temples and knotted at the nape,
bore crowns, or bunches, or sprays of mytosotis, jasmine, pomegranate
blossoms, ears of corn, and corn-flowers. Calmly seated in their places,
mothers with forbidding countenances were wearing red turbans.

<p/>Emma's heart beat rather faster when, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) by the
tips of the fingers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) place in a line with the dancers, and
waited for the first note to start. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) emotion soon vanished, and,
swaying to the rhythm of the orchestra, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) glided forward with slight
movements of the neck. A smile rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips at certain delicate
phrases of the violin, that sometimes played alone while the other
instruments were silent; one could hear the clear clink of the louis
d’or that were being thrown down upon the card tables in the next room;
then all struck again, the cornet-a-piston uttered its sonorous note,
feet marked time, skirts swelled and rustled, hands touched and parted;
the same eyes falling before you met yours again.

<p/>A few men -LRB-some fifteen or so-RRB-, of twenty-five to forty, scattered here
and there among the dancers or talking at the doorways, distinguished
themselves from the crowd by a certain air of breeding, whatever their
differences in age, dress, or face.

<p/>Their clothes, better made, seemed of finer cloth, and their hair,
brought forward in curls towards the temples, glossy with more delicate
pomades. They had the complexion of wealth--that clear complexion that
is heightened by the pallor of porcelain, the shimmer of satin, the
veneer of old furniture, and that an ordered regimen of exquisite
nurture maintains at its best. Their necks moved easily in their low
cravats, their long whiskers fell over their turned-down collars, they
wiped their lips upon handkerchiefs with embroidered initials that gave
forth a subtle perfume. Those who were beginning to grow old had an air
of youth, while there was something mature in the faces of the young.
In their unconcerned looks was the calm of passions daily satiated, and
through all their gentleness of manner pierced that peculiar brutality,
the result of a command of half-easy things, in which force is exercised
and vanity amused--the management of thoroughbred horses and the society
of loose women.

<p/>A few steps from Emma a gentleman in a blue coat was talking of Italy
with a pale young woman wearing a parure of pearls.

<p/>They were praising the breadth of the columns of St. Peter's, Tivoly,
Vesuvius, Castellamare, and Cassines, the roses of Genoa, the Coliseum
by moonlight. With her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other ear Emma was listening to a conversation
full of words she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not understand. A circle gathered round a very
young man who the week before had beaten <div class="bookquote">``Miss Arabella''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Romolus,''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>and won two thousand louis jumping a ditch in England. One complained
that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) racehorses were growing fat; another of the printers' errors
that had disfigured the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse.

<p/>The atmosphere of the ball was heavy; the lamps were growing dim.

<p/>Guests were flocking to the billiard room. A servant got upon a chair
and broke the window-panes. At the crash of the glass Madame Bovary
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head and saw in the garden the faces of peasants pressed
against the window looking in at them. Then the memory of the Bertaux
came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the farm again, the muddy pond, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father in
a blouse under the apple trees, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw herself again as formerly,
skimming with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) finger the cream off the milk-pans in the dairy. But
in the refulgence of the present hour her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) past life, so distinct until
then, faded away completely, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) almost doubted having lived it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was there; beyond the ball was only shadow overspreading all the rest.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was just eating a maraschino ice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) held with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) left hand
in a silver-gilt cup, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes half-closed, and the spoon between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
teeth.

<p/>A lady near her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fan. A gentlemen was passing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you be so good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, <div class="bookquote">``as to pick up my fan that has
fallen behind the sofa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman bowed, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) moved to stretch out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm, Emma saw
the hand of a young woman throw something white, folded in a triangle,
into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat. The gentleman, picking up the fan, offered it to the lady
respectfully; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with an inclination of the head, and began
smelling her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bouquet.

<p/>After supper, where were plenty of Spanish and Rhine wines, soups a la
bisque and au lait d’amandes*, puddings a la Trafalgar, and all sorts of
cold meats with jellies that trembled in the dishes, the carriages one
after the other began to drive off. Raising the corners of the muslin
curtain, one could see the light of their lanterns glimmering through
the darkness. The seats began to empty, some card-players were still
left; the musicians were cooling the tips of their fingers on their
tongues. Charles was half asleep, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back propped against a door.

<p/>*With almond milk

<p/>At three o’clock the cotillion began. Emma did not know how to waltz.
Everyone was waltzing, Mademoiselle d’Andervilliers herself and the
Marquis; only the guests staying at the castle were still there, about a
dozen persons.

<p/>One of the waltzers, however, who was familiarly called Viscount, and
whose low cut waistcoat seemed moulded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chest, came a second time
to ask Madame Bovary to dance, assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>), and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) would get through it very well.

<p/>They began slowly, then went more rapidly. They turned; all around them
was turning--the lamps, the furniture, the wainscoting, the floor, like
a disc on a pivot. On passing near the doors the bottom of Emma's dress
caught against his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) trousers.

<p/>Their legs commingled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). A torpor seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped. They started again, and with a
more rapid movement; the Viscount, dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) along disappeared with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to the end of the gallery, where panting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) almost fell, and for
a moment rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) breast. And then, still turning, but
more slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) guided her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leaned back against the
wall and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opened them again, in the middle of the drawing room three
waltzers were kneeling before a lady sitting on a stool.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chose the Viscount, and the violin struck up once more.

<p/>Everyone looked at them. They passed and re-passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with rigid body,
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chin bent down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) always in the same pose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) figure curved,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) elbow rounded, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chin thrown forward. That woman knew how to
waltz! They kept up a long time, and tired out all the others.

<p/>Then they talked a few moments longer, and after the goodnights, or
rather good mornings, the guests of the chateau retired to bed.

<p/>Charles dragged himself up by the balusters. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``knees were going
up into his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) body.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had spent five consecutive hours standing
bolt upright at the card tables, watching them play whist, without
understanding anything about it, and it was with a deep sigh of relief
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) boots.

<p/>Emma threw a shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulders, opened the window, and leant out.

<p/>The night was dark; some drops of rain were falling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breathed in the
damp wind that refreshed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyelids. The music of the ball was still
murmuring in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ears. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to keep herself awake in order to
prolong the illusion of this luxurious life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would soon have to
give up.

<p/>Day began to break. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked long at the windows of the chateau,
trying to guess which were the rooms of all those she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had noticed the
evening before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would fain have known their lives, have penetrated,
blended with them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was shivering with cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) undressed, and
cowered down between the sheets against Charles, who was asleep.

<p/>There were a great many people to luncheon. The repast lasted ten
minutes; no liqueurs were served, which astonished the doctor.

<p/>Next, Mademoiselle d’Andervilliers collected some pieces of roll in a
small basket to take them to the swans on the ornamental waters, and
they went to walk in the hot-houses, where strange plants, bristling
with hairs, rose in pyramids under hanging vases, whence, as from
over-filled nests of serpents, fell long green cords interlacing.
The orangery, which was at the other end, led by a covered way to the
outhouses of the chateau. The Marquis, to amuse the young woman, took
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to see the stables.

<p/>Above the basket-shaped racks porcelain slabs bore the names of the
horses in black letters. Each animal in its stall whisked its tail when
anyone went near and said <div class="bookquote">``Tchk! tchk!''  (<font color='red'><b>anyone</b></font>)</div>The boards of the harness room
shone like the flooring of a drawing room. The carriage harness was
piled up in the middle against two twisted columns, and the bits, the
whips, the spurs, the curbs, were ranged in a line all along the wall.

<p/>Charles, meanwhile, went to ask a groom to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) horse to. The
dog-cart was brought to the foot of the steps, and, all the parcels
being crammed in, the Bovarys paid their respects to the Marquis and
Marchioness and set out again for Tostes.

<p/>Emma watched the turning wheels in silence. Charles, on the extreme edge
of the seat, held the reins with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) two arms wide apart, and the little
horse ambled along in the shafts that were too big for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). The loose
reins hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) crupper were wet with foam, and the box fastened
on behind the chaise gave great regular bumps against it.

<p/>They were on the heights of Thibourville when suddenly some horsemen
with cigars between their lips passed laughing. Emma thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
recognized the Viscount, turned back, and caught on the horizon only the
movement of the heads rising or falling with the unequal cadence of the
trot or gallop.

<p/>A mile farther on they had to stop to mend with some string the traces
that had broken.

<p/>But Charles, giving a last look to the harness, saw something on the
ground between his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) horse's legs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) picked up a cigar-case with
a green silk border and beblazoned in the centre like the door of a
carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are even two cigars in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``they'll do for this evening
after dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, do you smoke?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes, when I get a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) find in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pocket and whipped up the nag.

<p/>When they reached home the dinner was not ready. Madame lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) temper.
Nastasie answered rudely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave the room!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``You are forgetting yourself. I give you
warning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For dinner there was onion soup and a piece of veal with sorrel.

<p/>Charles, seated opposite Emma, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands gleefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How good it is to be at home again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nastasie</b></font>)</div><p/>Nastasie could be heard crying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was rather fond of the poor girl.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had formerly, during the wearisome time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) widowhood, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
company many an evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) first patient, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) oldest
acquaintance in the place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you given her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) warning for good?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Who is to prevent me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) replied.

<p/>Then they warmed themselves in the kitchen while their room was being
made ready. Charles began to smoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) smoked with lips protruding,
spitting every moment, recoiling at every puff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll make yourself ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said scornfully.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cigar and ran to swallow a glass of cold water at the
pump. Emma seizing hold of the cigar case threw it quickly to the back
of the cupboard.

<p/>The next day was a long one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) little garden, up
and down the same walks, stopping before the beds, before the espalier,
before the plaster curate, looking with amazement at all these things
of once-on-a-time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew so well. How far off the ball seemed
already! What was it that thus set so far asunder the morning of the day
before yesterday and the evening of to-day? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) journey to Vaubyessard
had made a hole in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life, like one of those great crevices that
a storm will sometimes make in one night in mountains. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
resigned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) devoutly put away in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drawers her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) beautiful dress, down
to the satin shoes whose soles were yellowed with the slippery wax of
the dancing floor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart was like these. In its friction against
wealth something had come over it that could not be effaced.

<p/>The memory of this ball, then, became an occupation for Emma.

<p/>Whenever the Wednesday came round she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) awoke, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
I was there a week--a fortnight--three weeks ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And little by little the faces grew confused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) remembrance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forgot the tune of the quadrilles; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) no longer saw the liveries
and appointments so distinctly; some details escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), but the regret
remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).



<p/>Chapter Nine

<p/>Often when Charles was out she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took from the cupboard, between the
folds of the linen where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had left it, the green silk cigar case.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at it, opened it, and even smelt the odour of the lining--a
mixture of verbena and tobacco. Whose was it? The Viscount's? Perhaps
it was a present from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mistress. It had been embroidered on some
rosewood frame, a pretty little thing, hidden from all eyes, that had
occupied many hours, and over which had fallen the soft curls of the
pensive worker. A breath of love had passed over the stitches on the
canvas; each prick of the needle had fixed there a hope or a memory, and
all those interwoven threads of silk were but the continuity of the same
silent passion. And then one morning the Viscount had taken it away
with him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>). Of what had they spoken when it lay upon the wide-mantelled
chimneys between flower-vases and Pompadour clocks? She (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) was at Tostes;
he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) was at Paris now, far away! What was this Paris like? What a vague
name! She (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) repeated it in a low voice, for the mere pleasure of it; it
rang in her (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) ears like a great cathedral bell; it shone before her (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) eyes,
even on the labels of her (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) pomade-pots.

<p/>At night, when the carriers passed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) windows in their carts
singing the <div class="bookquote">``Marjolaine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the carriers</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) awoke, and listened to the noise of the
iron-bound wheels, which, as they gained the country road, was soon
deadened by the soil. <div class="bookquote">``They will be there to-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) said to
herself.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) followed them in thought up and down the hills, traversing
villages, gliding along the highroads by the light of the stars. At the
end of some indefinite distance there was always a confused spot, into
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) dream died.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) bought a plan of Paris, and with the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) finger on the map
she (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) walked about the capital. She (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) went up the boulevards, stopping at
every turning, between the lines of the streets, in front of the white
squares that represented the houses. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) would close the lids of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) weary eyes, and see in the darkness the gas jets flaring in the wind
and the steps of carriages lowered with much noise before the peristyles
of theatres.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) took in <div class="bookquote">``La Corbeille,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>a lady's journal, and the <div class="bookquote">``Sylphe des
Salons.''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) devoured, without skipping a word, all the accounts of
first nights, races, and soirees, took interest in the debut of a
singer, in the opening of a new shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) knew the latest fashions, the
addresses of the best tailors, the days of the Bois and the Opera. In
Eugene Sue she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) studied descriptions of furniture; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) read Balzac and
George Sand, seeking in them imaginary satisfaction for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own desires.
Even at table she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) book by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and turned over the pages
while Charles ate and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). The memory of the Viscount always
returned as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) read. Between him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and the imaginary personages she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) made
comparisons. But the circle of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was the centre gradually widened
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and the aureole that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bore, fading from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) form, broadened
out beyond, lighting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) other dreams.

<p/>Paris, more vague than the ocean, glimmered before Emma's eyes in an
atmosphere of vermilion. The many lives that stirred amid this tumult
were, however, divided into parts, classed as distinct pictures. Emma
perceived only two or three that hid from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) all the rest, and in
themselves represented all humanity. The world of ambassadors moved over
polished floors in drawing rooms lined with mirrors, round oval tables
covered with velvet and gold-fringed cloths. There were dresses with
trains, deep mysteries, anguish hidden beneath smiles. Then came the
society of the duchesses; all were pale; all got up at four o’clock; the
women, poor angels, wore English point on their petticoats; and the men,
unappreciated geniuses under a frivolous outward seeming, rode horses to
death at pleasure parties, spent the summer season at Baden, and towards
the forties married heiresses. In the private rooms of restaurants,
where one sups after midnight by the light of wax candles, laughed the
motley crowd of men of letters and actresses. They were prodigal as
kings, full of ideal, ambitious, fantastic frenzy. This was an existence
outside that of all others, between heaven and earth, in the midst of
storms, having something of the sublime. For the rest of the world it
was lost, with no particular place and as if non-existent. The nearer
things were, moreover, the more her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) thoughts turned away from them.
All her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) immediate surroundings, the wearisome country, the middle-class
imbeciles, the mediocrity of existence, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) exceptional, a
peculiar chance that had caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>), while beyond stretched, as
far as eye could see, an immense land of joys and passions. She (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) confused
in her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) desire the sensualities of luxury with the delights of the heart,
elegance of manners with delicacy of sentiment. Did not love, like
Indian plants, need a special soil, a particular temperature? Signs
by moonlight, long embraces, tears flowing over yielded hands, all
the fevers of the flesh and the languors of tenderness could not be
separated from the balconies of great castles full of indolence,
from boudoirs with silken curtains and thick carpets, well-filled
flower-stands, a bed on a raised dias, nor from the flashing of precious
stones and the shoulder-knots of liveries.

<p/>The lad from the posting house who came to groom the mare every morning
passed through the passage with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) heavy wooden shoes; there were holes
in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) blouse; his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) feet were bare in list slippers. And this was the
groom in knee-britches with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had to be content! His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) work done,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) did not come back again all day, for Charles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) return put up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) horse himself, unsaddled him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and put on the halter, while the
servant-girl brought a bundle of straw and threw it as best she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) could
into the manger.

<p/>To replace Nastasie -LRB-who left Tostes shedding torrents of tears-RRB- Emma
took into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) service a young girl of fourteen, an orphan with a sweet
face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forbade her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wearing cotton caps, taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to address her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in
the third person, to bring a glass of water on a plate, to knock before
coming into a room, to iron, starch, and to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--wanted to make a
lady's-maid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The new servant obeyed without a murmur, so as not
to be sent away; and as madame usually left the key in the sideboard,
Felicite every evening took a small supply of sugar that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ate alone
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bed after she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prayers.

<p/>Sometimes in the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to chat with the postilions.

<p/>Madame was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room upstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wore an open dressing gown that
showed between the shawl facings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bodice a pleated chamisette with
three gold buttons. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) belt was a corded girdle with great tassels, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) small garnet coloured slippers had a large knot of ribbon that fell
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) instep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had bought herself a blotting book, writing case,
pen-holder, and envelopes, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no one to write to; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
dusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) what-not, looked at herself in the glass, picked up a book,
and then, dreaming between the lines, let it drop on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
longed to travel or to go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished at the same
time to die and to live in Paris.

<p/>Charles in snow and rain trotted across country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ate omelettes on
farmhouse tables, poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arm into damp beds, received the tepid
spurt of blood-lettings in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face, listened to death-rattles, examined
basins, turned over a good deal of dirty linen; but every evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
found a blazing fire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dinner ready, easy-chairs, and a well-dressed
woman, charming with an odour of freshness, though no one could say
whence the perfume came, or if it were not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skin that made odorous
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chemise.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) by numerous attentions; now it was some new way of
arranging paper sconces for the candles, a flounce that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) altered on
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gown, or an extraordinary name for some very simple dish that the
servant had spoilt, but that Charles swallowed with pleasure to the last
mouthful. At Rouen she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw some ladies who wore a bunch of charms on the
watch-chains; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bought some charms. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mantelpiece two
large blue glass vases, and some time after an ivory necessaire with a
silver-gilt thimble. The less Charles understood these refinements
the more they seduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). They added something to the pleasure of the
senses and to the comfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fireside. It was like a golden dust
sanding all along the narrow path of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) life.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was well, looked well; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reputation was firmly established.

<p/>The country-folk loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was not proud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) petted the
children, never went to the public house, and, moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) morals
inspired confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was specially successful with catarrhs and chest
complaints. Being much afraid of killing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) patients, Charles, in fact
only prescribed sedatives, from time to time and emetic, a footbath,
or leeches. It was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was afraid of surgery; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bled people
copiously like horses, and for the taking out of teeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had the
<div class="bookquote">``devil's own wrist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Finally, to keep up with the times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took in <div class="bookquote">``La Ruche Medicale,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a new journal whose prospectus had been sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) read it a little
after dinner, but in about five minutes the warmth of the room added to
the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dinner sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to sleep; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sat there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) chin
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) two hands and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hair spreading like a mane to the foot of the
lamp. Emma looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulders. Why, at least, was
not her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband one of those men of taciturn passions who work at their
books all night, and at last, when about sixty, the age of rheumatism
sets in, wear a string of orders on their ill-fitting black coat?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have wished this name of Bovary, which was hers, had been
illustrious, to see it displayed at the booksellers', repeated in the
newspapers, known to all France. But Charles had no ambition.

<p/>An Yvetot doctor whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had lately met in consultation had somewhat
humiliated him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at the very bedside of the patient, before the assembled
relatives. When, in the evening, Charles told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) this anecdote, Emma
inveighed loudly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) colleague. Charles was much touched. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forehead with a tear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was angered with
shame; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt a wild desire to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to open the window
in the passage and breathed in the fresh air to calm herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a man! What a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said in a low voice, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips.

<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was becoming more irritated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grew older his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
manner grew heavier; at dessert he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cut the corks of the empty bottles;
after eating he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cleaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) teeth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tongue; in taking soup
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made a gurgling noise with every spoonful; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was getting
fatter, the puffed-out cheeks seemed to push the eyes, always small, up
to the temples.

<p/>Sometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) under-vest unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
waistcoat, rearranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cravat, and threw away the dirty gloves he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
going to put on; and this was not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fancied, for himself; it
was for herself, by a diffusion of egotism, of nervous irritation.
Sometimes, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had read, such as a passage in
a novel, of a new play, or an anecdote of the <div class="bookquote">``upper ten''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had seen in a feuilleton; for, after all, Charles was something, an
ever-open ear, and ever-ready approbation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) confided many a thing to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) greyhound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have done so to the logs in the fireplace or to
the pendulum of the clock.

<p/>At the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was waiting for something to
happen. Like shipwrecked sailors, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned despairing eyes upon the
solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of
the horizon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not know what this chance would be, what wind would
bring it her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), towards what shore it would drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), if it would be a
shallop or a three-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to the
portholes. But each morning, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) awoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped it would come that
day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened to every sound, sprang up with a start, wondered that
it did not come; then at sunset, always more saddened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) longed for
the morrow.

<p/>Spring came round. With the first warm weather, when the pear trees
began to blossom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suffered from dyspnoea.

<p/>From the beginning of July she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) counted how many weeks there were to
October, thinking that perhaps the Marquis d’Andervilliers would give
another ball at Vaubyessard. But all September passed without letters or
visits.

<p/>After the ennui of this disappointment her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart once more remained
empty, and then the same series of days recommenced. So now they would
thus follow one another, always the same, immovable, and bringing
nothing. Other lives, however flat, had at least the chance of some
event. One adventure sometimes brought with it infinite consequences and
the scene changed. But nothing happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); God had willed it so!
The future was a dark corridor, with its door at the end shut fast.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave up music. What was the good of playing? Who would hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)?
Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could never, in a velvet gown with short sleeves, striking
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) light fingers the ivory keys of an Erard at a concert, feel
the murmur of ecstasy envelop her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) like a breeze, it was not worth while
boring herself with practicing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drawing cardboard and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) embroidery
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) left in the cupboard. What was the good? What was the good? Sewing
irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have read everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to herself. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
sat there making the tongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling.

<p/>How sad she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was on Sundays when vespers sounded! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened with dull
attention to each stroke of the cracked bell. A cat slowly walking over
some roof put up his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) back in the pale rays of the sun. The wind on the
highroad blew up clouds of dust. Afar off a dog sometimes howled; and
the bell, keeping time, continued its monotonous ringing that died away
over the fields.

<p/>But the people came out from church. The women in waxed clogs, the
peasants in new blouses, the little bare-headed children skipping along
in front of them, all were going home. And till nightfall, five or six
men, always the same, stayed playing at corks in front of the large door
of the inn.

<p/>The winter was severe. The windows every morning were covered with
rime, and the light shining through them, dim as through ground-glass,
sometimes did not change the whole day long. At four o’clock the lamp
had to be lighted.

<p/>On fine days she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) went down into the garden. The dew had left on the
cabbages a silver lace with long transparent threads spreading from one
to the other. No birds were to be heard; everything seemed asleep, the
espalier covered with straw, and the vine, like a great sick serpent
under the coping of the wall, along which, on drawing near, one saw the
many-footed woodlice crawling. Under the spruce by the hedgerow, the
curie in the three-cornered hat reading his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) breviary had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) right
foot, and the very plaster, scaling off with the frost, had left white
scabs on his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) face.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) went up again, shut her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) door, put on coals, and fainting with
the heat of the hearth, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) boredom weigh more heavily than ever.
She (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) would have liked to go down and talk to the servant, but a sense of
shame restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>).

<p/>Every day at the same time the schoolmaster in a black skullcap opened
the shutters of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) house, and the rural policeman, wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sabre
over his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) blouse, passed by. Night and morning the post-horses, three by
three, crossed the street to water at the pond. From time to time the
bell of a public house door rang, and when it was windy one could hear
the little brass basins that served as signs for the hairdresser's shop
creaking on their two rods. This shop had as decoration an old engraving
of a fashion-plate stuck against a windowpane and the wax bust of a
woman with yellow hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), too, the hairdresser, lamented his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wasted
calling, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hopeless future, and dreaming of some shop in a big
town--at Rouen, for example, overlooking the harbour, near the
theatre--he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) walked up and down all day from the mairie to the church,
sombre and waiting for customers. When Madame Bovary looked up, she (<font color='blue'><b>hairdresser</b></font>)
always saw him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) there, like a sentinel on duty, with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) skullcap over
his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ears and his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) vest of lasting.

<p/>Sometimes in the afternoon outside the window of her (<font color='blue'><b>hairdresser</b></font>) room, the head of a
man appeared, a swarthy head with black whiskers, smiling slowly, with
a broad, gentle smile that showed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) white teeth. A waltz immediately
began and on the organ, in a little drawing room, dancers the size of
a finger, women in pink turbans, Tyrolians in jackets, monkeys in frock
coats, gentlemen in knee-breeches, turned and turned between the sofas,
the consoles, multiplied in the bits of looking glass held together
at their corners by a piece of gold paper. The man turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handle,
looking to the right and left, and up at the windows. Now and again,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shot out a long squirt of brown saliva against the milestone,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instrument, whose hard straps tired his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shoulder; and now, doleful and drawling, or gay and hurried, the music
escaped from the box, droning through a curtain of pink taffeta under
a brass claw in arabesque. They were airs played in other places at
the theatres, sung in drawing rooms, danced to at night under lighted
lustres, echoes of the world that reached even to Emma. Endless
sarabands ran through her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, and, like an Indian dancing girl on the
flowers of a carpet, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thoughts leapt with the notes, swung from dream
to dream, from sadness to sadness. When the man had caught some coppers
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew down an old cover of blue cloth, hitched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) organ
on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, and went off with a heavy tread. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going.

<p/>But it was above all the meal-times that were unbearable to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), in this
small room on the ground floor, with its smoking stove, its creaking
door, the walls that sweated, the damp flags; all the bitterness in life
seemed served up on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) plate, and with smoke of the boiled beef there
rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) secret soul whiffs of sickliness. Charles was a slow
eater; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) played with a few nuts, or, leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) elbow, amused
herself with drawing lines along the oilcloth table cover with the point
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knife.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now let everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) household take care of itself, and Madame
Bovary senior, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came to spend part of Lent at Tostes, was much
surprised at the change. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who was formerly so careful, so dainty,
now passed whole days without dressing, wore grey cotton stockings, and
burnt tallow candles. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept saying they must be economical since
they were not rich, adding that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very contented, very happy, that
Tostes pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very much, with other speeches that closed the mouth
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother-in-law. Besides, Emma no longer seemed inclined to follow
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) advice; once even, Madame Bovary having thought fit to maintain that
mistresses ought to keep an eye on the religion of their servants, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had answered with so angry a look and so cold a smile that the good
woman did not interfere again.

<p/>Emma was growing difficult, capricious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ordered dishes for herself,
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not touch them; one day drank only pure milk, the next
cups of tea by the dozen. Often she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) persisted in not going out, then,
stifling, threw open the windows and put on light dresses. After she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
well scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) servant she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) presents or sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out to see
neighbours, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sometimes threw beggars all the silver in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
purse, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was by no means tender-hearted or easily accessible
to the feelings of others, like most country-bred people, who always
retain in their souls something of the horny hardness of the paternal
hands.

<p/>Towards the end of February old Rouault, in memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) cure, himself
brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) son-in-law a superb turkey, and stayed three days at Tostes.
Charles being with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) patients, Emma kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) company. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) smoked in the
room, spat on the firedogs, talked farming, calves, cows, poultry, and
municipal council, so that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) left she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) closed the door on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with
a feeling of satisfaction that surprised even herself. Moreover she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) no
longer concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) contempt for anything or anybody, and at times she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
set herself to express singular opinions, finding fault with that which
others approved, and approving things perverse and immoral, all of which
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband open his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes widely.

<p/>Would this misery last for ever? Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) never issue from it? Yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was as good as all the women who were living happily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had seen
duchesses at Vaubyessard with clumsier waists and commoner ways, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
execrated the injustice of God. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leant her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head against the walls
to weep; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) envied lives of stir; longed for masked balls, for violent
pleasures, with all the wildness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not know, but that these
must surely yield.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grew pale and suffered from palpitations of the heart.

<p/>Charles prescribed valerian and camphor baths. Everything that was tried
only seemed to irritate her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the more.

<p/>On certain days she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chatted with feverish rapidity, and this
over-excitement was suddenly followed by a state of torpor, in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) remained without speaking, without moving. What then revived her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
pouring a bottle of eau-de-cologne over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was constantly complaining about Tostes, Charles fancied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
illness was no doubt due to some local cause, and fixing on this idea,
began to think seriously of setting up elsewhere.

<p/>From that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drank vinegar, contracted a sharp little cough, and
completely lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) appetite.

<p/>It cost Charles much to give up Tostes after living there four years and
<div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beginning to get on there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>Yet if it must be! He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
to Rouen to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) old master. It was a nervous complaint: change of
air was needed.

<p/>After looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) on this side and on that, Charles learnt that
in the Neufchatel arrondissement there was a considerable market town
called Yonville-l’Abbaye, whose doctor, a Polish refugee, had decamped a
week before. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wrote to the chemist of the place to ask the
number of the population, the distance from the nearest doctor, what
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) predecessor had made a year, and so forth; and the answer being
satisfactory, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mind to move towards the spring, if Emma's
health did not improve.

<p/>One day when, in view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) departure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was tidying a drawer,
something pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) finger. It was a wire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wedding bouquet.
The orange blossoms were yellow with dust and the silver bordered satin
ribbons frayed at the edges. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw it into the fire. It flared
up more quickly than dry straw. Then it was, like a red bush in the
cinders, slowly devoured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) watched it burn.

<p/>The little pasteboard berries burst, the wire twisted, the gold
lace melted; and the shriveled paper corollas, fluttering like black
butterflies at the back of the stove, at last flew up the chimney.

<p/>When they left Tostes at the month of March, Madame Bovary was pregnant.





<p/>Part II



<p/>Chapter One

<p/>Yonville-l’Abbaye -LRB-so called from an old Capuchin abbey of which not
even the ruins remain-RRB- is a market-town twenty-four miles from Rouen,
between the Abbeville and Beauvais roads, at the foot of a valley
watered by the Rieule, a little river that runs into the Andelle after
turning three water-mills near its mouth, where there are a few trout
that the lads amuse themselves by fishing for on Sundays.

<p/>We leave the highroad at La Boissiere and keep straight on to the top of
the Leux hill, whence the valley is seen. The river that runs through it
makes of it, as it were, two regions with distinct physiognomies--all on
the left is pasture land, all of the right arable. The meadow stretches
under a bulge of low hills to join at the back with the pasture land of
the Bray country, while on the eastern side, the plain, gently rising,
broadens out, showing as far as eye can follow its blond cornfields. The
water, flowing by the grass, divides with a white line the colour of the
roads and of the plains, and the country is like a great unfolded mantle
with a green velvet cape bordered with a fringe of silver.

<p/>Before us, on the verge of the horizon, lie the oaks of the forest of
Argueil, with the steeps of the Saint-Jean hills scarred from top
to bottom with red irregular lines; they are rain tracks, and these
brick-tones standing out in narrow streaks against the grey colour of
the mountain are due to the quantity of iron springs that flow beyond in
the neighboring country.

<p/>Here we are on the confines of Normandy, Picardy, and the Ile-de-France,
a bastard land whose language is without accent and its landscape is
without character. It is there that they make the worst Neufchatel
cheeses of all the arrondissement; and, on the other hand, farming is
costly because so much manure is needed to enrich this friable soil full
of sand and flints.

<p/>Up to 1835 there was no practicable road for getting to Yonville, but
about this time a cross-road was made which joins that of Abbeville to
that of Amiens, and is occasionally used by the Rouen wagoners on their
way to Flanders. Yonville-l’Abbaye has remained stationary in spite of
its <div class="bookquote">``new outlet.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Instead of improving the soil, they persist in keeping
up the pasture lands, however depreciated they may be in value, and
the lazy borough, growing away from the plain, has naturally spread
riverwards. It is seem from afar sprawling along the banks like a
cowherd taking a siesta by the water-side.

<p/>At the foot of the hill beyond the bridge begins a roadway, planted with
young aspens, that leads in a straight line to the first houses in the
place. These, fenced in by hedges, are in the middle of courtyards
full of straggling buildings, wine-presses, cart-sheds and distilleries
scattered under thick trees, with ladders, poles, or scythes hung on to
the branches. The thatched roofs, like fur caps drawn over eyes, reach
down over about a third of the low windows, whose coarse convex glasses
have knots in the middle like the bottoms of bottles. Against the
plaster wall diagonally crossed by black joists, a meagre pear-tree
sometimes leans and the ground-floors have at their door a small
swing-gate to keep out the chicks that come pilfering crumbs of bread
steeped in cider on the threshold. But the courtyards grow narrower,
the houses closer together, and the fences disappear; a bundle of
ferns swings under a window from the end of a broomstick; there is a
blacksmith's forge and then a wheelwright's, with two or three new carts
outside that partly block the way. Then across an open space appears a
white house beyond a grass mound ornamented by a Cupid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) finger
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) lips; two brass vases are at each end of a flight of steps;
scutcheons* blaze upon the door. It is the notary's house, and the
finest in the place.

<p/>*The panonceaux that have to be hung over the doors of
notaries.

<p/>The Church is on the other side of the street, twenty paces farther
down, at the entrance of the square. The little cemetery that surrounds
it, closed in by a wall breast high, is so full of graves that the old
stones, level with the ground, form a continuous pavement, on which the
grass of itself has marked out regular green squares. The church was
rebuilt during the last years of the reign of Charles X. The wooden roof
is beginning to rot from the top, and here and there has black hollows
in its blue colour. Over the door, where the organ should be, is a
loft for the men, with a spiral staircase that reverberates under their
wooden shoes.

<p/>The daylight coming through the plain glass windows falls obliquely upon
the pews ranged along the walls, which are adorned here and there with
a straw mat bearing beneath it the words in large letters, <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
So-and-so's pew.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Virgin</b></font>)</div>Farther on, at a spot where the building narrows, the
confessional forms a pendant to a statuette of the Virgin, clothed in
a satin robe, coifed with a tulle veil sprinkled with silver stars, and
with red cheeks, like an idol of the Sandwich Islands; and, finally, a
copy of the <div class="bookquote">``Holy Family, presented by the Minister of the Interior,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Virgin</b></font>)</div>overlooking the high altar, between four candlesticks, closes in the
perspective. The choir stalls, of deal wood, have been left unpainted.

<p/>The market, that is to say, a tiled roof supported by some twenty posts,
occupies of itself about half the public square of Yonville. The town
hall, constructed <div class="bookquote">``from the designs of a Paris architect,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>is a sort of
Greek temple that forms the corner next to the chemist's shop. On
the ground-floor are three Ionic columns and on the first floor a
semicircular gallery, while the dome that crowns it is occupied by a
Gallic cock, resting one foot upon the <div class="bookquote">``Charte''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and holding in the other
the scales of Justice.

<p/>But that which most attracts the eye is opposite the Lion d’Or inn, the
chemist's shop of Monsieur Homais. In the evening especially its argand
lamp is lit up and the red and green jars that embellish his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) shop-front
throw far across the street their two streams of colour; then across
them as if in Bengal lights is seen the shadow of the chemist
leaning over his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) desk. His (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) house from top to bottom is placarded with
inscriptions written in large hand, round hand, printed hand: <div class="bookquote">``Vichy,
Seltzer, Barege waters, blood purifiers, Raspail patent medicine,
Arabian racahout, Darcet lozenges, Regnault paste, trusses, baths,
hygienic chocolate,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>etc.. And the signboard, which takes up all the
breadth of the shop, bears in gold letters, <div class="bookquote">``Homais, Chemist.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then at
the back of the shop, behind the great scales fixed to the counter, the
word <div class="bookquote">``Laboratory''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>appears on a scroll above a glass door, which about
half-way up once more repeats <div class="bookquote">``Homais''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in gold letters on a black
ground.

<p/>Beyond this there is nothing to see at Yonville. The street -LRB-the only
one-RRB- a gunshot in length and flanked by a few shops on either side stops
short at the turn of the highroad. If it is left on the right hand and
the foot of the Saint-Jean hills followed the cemetery is soon reached.

<p/>At the time of the cholera, in order to enlarge this, a piece of wall
was pulled down, and three acres of land by its side purchased; but all
the new portion is almost tenantless; the tombs, as heretofore,
continue to crowd together towards the gate. The keeper, who is at once
gravedigger and church beadle -LRB-thus making a double profit out of the
parish corpses-RRB-, has taken advantage of the unused plot of ground to
plant potatoes there. From year to year, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) small field grows
smaller, and when there is an epidemic, he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) does not know whether to
rejoice at the deaths or regret the burials.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You live on the dead, Lestiboudois!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>the curie at last said to him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) one
day. This grim remark made him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) reflect; it checked him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) for some time;
but to this day he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) carries on the cultivation of his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) little tubers, and
even maintains stoutly that they grow naturally.

<p/>Since the events about to be narrated, nothing in fact has changed
at Yonville. The tin tricolour flag still swings at the top of the
church-steeple; the two chintz streamers still flutter in the wind from
the linen-draper's; the chemist's fetuses, like lumps of white amadou,
rot more and more in their turbid alcohol, and above the big door of
the inn the old golden lion, faded by rain, still shows passers-by its
poodle mane.

<p/>On the evening when the Bovarys were to arrive at Yonville, Widow
Lefrancois, the landlady of this inn, was so very busy that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) sweated
great drops as she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) saucepans. To-morrow was market-day. The
meat had to be cut beforehand, the fowls drawn, the soup and coffee
made. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had the boarders' meal to see to, and that of the
doctor, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife, and their servant; the billiard-room was echoing with
bursts of laughter; three millers in a small parlour were calling for
brandy; the wood was blazing, the brazen pan was hissing, and on the
long kitchen table, amid the quarters of raw mutton, rose piles of
plates that rattled with the shaking of the block on which spinach was
being chopped.

<p/>From the poultry-yard was heard the screaming of the fowls whom the
servant was chasing in order to wring their necks.

<p/>A man slightly marked with small-pox, in green leather slippers, and
wearing a velvet cap with a gold tassel, was warming his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back at the
chimney. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face expressed nothing but self-satisfaction, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
appeared to take life as calmly as the goldfinch suspended over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head
in its wicker cage: this was the chemist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Artemise!''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>shouted the landlady, <div class="bookquote">``chop some wood, fill the water
bottles, bring some brandy, look sharp! If only I knew what dessert to
offer the guests you are expecting! Good heavens! Those furniture-movers
are beginning their racket in the billiard-room again; and their van has
been left before the front door! The `Hirondelle' might run into it when
it draws up. Call Polyte and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Chemist</b></font>) to put it up. Only think, Monsieur
Homais, that since morning they have had about fifteen games, and drunk
eight jars of cider! Why, they'll tear my cloth for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) went on,
looking at them from a distance, her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) strainer in her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That wouldn't be much of a loss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>replied Monsieur Homais. <div class="bookquote">``You would
buy another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another billiard-table!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the widow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since that one is coming to pieces, Madame Lefrancois. I tell you again
you are doing yourself harm, much harm! And besides, players now want
narrow pockets and heavy cues. Hazards aren't played now; everything is
changed! One must keep pace with the times! Just look at Tellier!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The hostess</b></font>)</div><p/>The hostess reddened with vexation. The chemist went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may say what you like; his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) table is better than yours; and if one
were to think, for example, of getting up a patriotic pool for Poland or
the sufferers from the Lyons floods--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't beggars like him (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) that'll frighten us,''  (<font color='red'><b>The chemist</b></font>)</div>interrupted the
landlady, shrugging her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) fat shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Monsieur Homais; as
long as the `Lion d’Or' exists people will come to it. We've feathered
our nest; while one of these days you'll find the `Cafe Francais' closed
with a big placard on the shutters. Change my billiard-table!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) went
on, speaking to herself, <div class="bookquote">``the table that comes in so handy for folding
the washing, and on which, in the hunting season, I have slept six
visitors! But that dawdler, Hivert, doesn't come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) for your gentlemen's dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>)! And what about Monsieur Binet? As the clock strikes
six you'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) come in, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) hasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) equal under the sun for
punctuality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) must always have his (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) seat in the small parlour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>)'d
rather die than dine anywhere else. And so squeamish as he (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) is, and so
particular about the cider! Not like Monsieur Leon; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) sometimes comes
at seven, or even half-past, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) doesn't so much as look at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
eats. Such a nice young man! Never speaks a rough word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see, there's a great difference between an educated man and
an old carabineer who is now a tax-collector.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Six o’clock struck. Binet came in.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) wore a blue frock-coat falling in a straight line round his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) thin
body, and his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) leather cap, with its lappets knotted over the top of
his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) head with string, showed under the turned-up peak a bald forehead,
flattened by the constant wearing of a helmet. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) wore a black cloth
waistcoat, a hair collar, grey trousers, and, all the year round,
well-blacked boots, that had two parallel swellings due to the sticking
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) big-toes. Not a hair stood out from the regular line of fair
whiskers, which, encircling his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) jaws, framed, after the fashion of a
garden border, his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) long, wan face, whose eyes were small and the nose
hooked. Clever at all games of cards, a good hunter, and writing a
fine hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had at home a lathe, and amused himself by turning napkin
rings, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) filled up his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) house, with the jealousy of an artist
and the egotism of a bourgeois.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) went to the small parlour, but the three millers had to be got out
first, and during the whole time necessary for laying the cloth, Binet
remained silent in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) place near the stove. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) shut the door and
took off his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) usual way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't with saying civil things that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll wear out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said
the chemist, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was along with the landlady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never talks more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Last week two travelers in the
cloth line were here--such clever chaps who told such jokes in the
evening, that I fairly cried with laughing; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood there like a
dab fish and never said a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>observed the chemist; <div class="bookquote">``no imagination, no sallies, nothing that
makes the society-man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet they say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has parts,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>objected the landlady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Parts!''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>replied Monsieur Homais; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), parts! In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own line it is
possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) added in a calmer tone. And he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! That a merchant, who has large connections, a jurisconsult, a
doctor, a chemist, should be thus absent-minded, that they should become
whimsical or even peevish, I can understand; such cases are cited in
history. But at least it is because they are thinking of something.
Myself, for example, how often has it happened to me to look on the
bureau for my pen to write a label, and to find, after all, that I had
put it behind my ear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Lefrancois just then went to the door to see if the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''
 (<font color='red'><b>Widow Lefrancois/Lefrancois</b></font>)</div>were not coming. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) started. A man dressed in black suddenly came into
the kitchen. By the last gleam of the twilight one could see that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
face was rubicund and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) form athletic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you, Monsieur le Curie?''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>asked the landlady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
reached down from the chimney one of the copper candlesticks placed
with their candles in a row. <div class="bookquote">``Will you take something? A thimbleful of
Cassis*? A glass of wine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>*Black currant liqueur.

<p/>The priest declined very politely. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had come for his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) umbrella, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had forgotten the other day at the Ernemont convent, and after
asking Madame Lefrancois to have it sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) at the presbytery in the
evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) left for the church, from which the Angelus was ringing.

<p/>When the chemist no longer heard the noise of his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) boots along the
square, he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) thought the priest's behaviour just now very unbecoming. This
refusal to take any refreshment seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) the most odious hypocrisy;
all priests tippled on the sly, and were trying to bring back the days
of the tithe.

<p/>The landlady took up the defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) curie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could double up four men like you over his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knee. Last year
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) helped our people to bring in the straw; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) carried as many as six
trusses at once, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is so strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist. <div class="bookquote">``Now just send your daughters to confess to
fellows which such a temperament! I, if I were the Government, I'd have
the priests bled once a month. Yes, Madame Lefrancois, every month--a
good phlebotomy, in the interests of the police and morals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, Monsieur Homais. You are an infidel; you've no religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>The chemist answered: <div class="bookquote">``I have a religion, my religion, and I even have
more than all these others with their mummeries and their juggling.
I adore God, on the contrary. I believe in the Supreme Being, in a
Creator, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) may be. I care little who has placed us here below
to fulfil our duties as citizens and fathers of families; but I don't
need to go to church to kiss silver plates, and fatten, out of my
pocket, a lot of good-for-nothings who live better than we do. For one
can know Him (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) as well in a wood, in a field, or even contemplating the
eternal vault like the ancients. My God! Mine is the God of Socrates, of
Franklin, of Voltaire, and of Beranger! I am for the profession of faith
of the `Savoyard Vicar,' and the immortal principles of `89! And I can't
admit of an old boy of a God who takes walks in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) garden with a
cane in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand, who lodges his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) friends in the belly of whales, dies
uttering a cry, and rises again at the end of three days; things absurd
in themselves, and completely opposed, moreover, to all physical laws,
which prove to us, by the way, that priests have always wallowed in
turpid ignorance, in which they would fain engulf the people with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) ceased, looking round for an audience, for in his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) bubbling over
the chemist had for a moment fancied himself in the midst of the town
council. But the landlady no longer heeded him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was listening to a
distant rolling. One could distinguish the noise of a carriage mingled
with the clattering of loose horseshoes that beat against the ground,
and at last the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>stopped at the door.

<p/>It was a yellow box on two large wheels, that, reaching to the tilt,
prevented travelers from seeing the road and dirtied their shoulders.
The small panes of the narrow windows rattled in their sashes when the
coach was closed, and retained here and there patches of mud amid the
old layers of dust, that not even storms of rain had altogether washed
away. It was drawn by three horses, the first a leader, and when it came
down-hill its bottom jolted against the ground.

<p/>Some of the inhabitants of Yonville came out into the square; they all
spoke at once, asking for news, for explanations, for hampers. Hivert
did not know whom to answer. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) who did the errands of the place
in town. He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) went to the shops and brought back rolls of leather for
the shoemaker, old iron for the farrier, a barrel of herrings for his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>)
mistress, caps from the milliner's, locks from the hair-dresser's and
all along the road on his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) return journey he (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) distributed his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) parcels,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) threw, standing upright on his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) seat and shouting at the top of
his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) voice, over the enclosures of the yards.

<p/>An accident had delayed him (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>). Madame Bovary's greyhound had run across
the field. They had whistled for him (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) a quarter of an hour; Hivert had
even gone back a mile and a half expecting every moment to catch sight
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>); but it had been necessary to go on.

<p/>Emma had wept, grown angry; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had accused Charles of this misfortune.
Monsieur Lheureux, a draper, who happened to be in the coach with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), had tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) by a number of examples of lost dogs
recognizing their masters at the end of long years. One, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said had
been told of, who had come back to Paris from Constantinople. Another
had gone one hundred and fifty miles in a straight line, and swum four
rivers; and his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) own father had possessed a poodle, which, after twelve
years of absence, had all of a sudden jumped on his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) back in the street
as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was going to dine in town.



<p/>Chapter Two

<p/>Emma got out first, then Felicite, Monsieur Lheureux, and a nurse, and
they had to wake up Charles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) corner, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had slept soundly
since night set in.

<p/>Homais introduced himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) homages to madame and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
respects to monsieur; said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was charmed to have been able to render
them some slight service, and added with a cordial air that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had
ventured to invite himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife being away.

<p/>When Madame Bovary was in the kitchen she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went up to the chimney.

<p/>With the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fingers she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dress at the knee, and
having thus pulled it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ankle, held out her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) foot in its black
boot to the fire above the revolving leg of mutton. The flame lit up the
whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), penetrating with a crude light the woof of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gowns, the
fine pores of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fair skin, and even her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyelids, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) blinked now
and again. A great red glow passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with the blowing of the wind
through the half-open door.

<p/>On the other side of the chimney a young man with fair hair watched her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
silently.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a good deal bored at Yonville, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a clerk at the
notary's, Monsieur Guillaumin, Monsieur Leon Dupuis -LRB-it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>) who
was the second habitue of the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RRB- frequently put back his (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>)
dinner-hour in hope that some traveler might come to the inn, with whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>) could chat in the evening. On the days when his (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>) work was done early,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>) had, for want of something else to do, to come punctually, and endure
from soup to cheese a tete-a-tete with Binet. It was therefore with
delight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>) accepted the landlady's suggestion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>) should dine
in company with the newcomers, and they passed into the large parlour
where Madame Lefrancois, for the purpose of showing off, had had the
table laid for four.

<p/>Homais asked to be allowed to keep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) skull-cap, for fear of coryza;
then, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) neighbour--

<p/>``Madame is no doubt a little fatigued; one gets jolted so abominably in
our `Hirondelle.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; <div class="bookquote">``but moving about always amuses me. I like
change of place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so tedious,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>sighed the clerk, <div class="bookquote">``to be always riveted to the same
places.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles, <div class="bookquote">``constantly obliged to be in the
saddle'' (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>Leon went on, addressing himself to Madame Bovary, <div class="bookquote">``nothing, it
seems to me, is more pleasant--when one can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>said the druggist, <div class="bookquote">``the practice of medicine is not very
hard work in our part of the world, for the state of our roads allows us
the use of gigs, and generally, as the farmers are prosperous, they pay
pretty well. We have, medically speaking, besides the ordinary cases
of enteritis, bronchitis, bilious affections, etc., now and then a
few intermittent fevers at harvest-time; but on the whole, little of a
serious nature, nothing special to note, unless it be a great deal of
scrofula, due, no doubt, to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our
peasant dwellings. Ah! you will find many prejudices to combat, Monsieur
Bovary, much obstinacy of routine, with which all the efforts of your
science will daily come into collision; for people still have recourse
to novenas, to relics, to the priest, rather than come straight to the
doctor or the chemist. The climate, however, is not, truth to tell, bad,
and we even have a few nonagenarians in our parish. The thermometer -LRB-I
have made some observations-RRB- falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade
at the outside, which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum, or
otherwise 54 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB-English scale-RRB-, not more. And, as a
matter of fact, we are sheltered from the north winds by the forest of
Argueil on the one side, from the west winds by the St. Jean range on
the other; and this heat, moreover, which, on account of the aqueous
vapours given off by the river and the considerable number of cattle
in the fields, which, as you know, exhale much ammonia, that is to say,
nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen -LRB-no, nitrogen and hydrogen alone-RRB-, and
which sucking up into itself the humus from the ground, mixing together
all those different emanations, unites them into a stack, so to say,
and combining with the electricity diffused through the atmosphere, when
there is any, might in the long run, as in tropical countries, engender
insalubrious miasmata--this heat, I say, finds itself perfectly tempered
on the side whence it comes, or rather whence it should come--that is to
say, the southern side--by the south-eastern winds, which, having cooled
themselves passing over the Seine, reach us sometimes all at once like
breezes from Russia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>continued
Madame Bovary, speaking to the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very few,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``There is a place they call La Pature, on
the top of the hill, on the edge of the forest. Sometimes, on Sundays, I
go and stay there with a book, watching the sunset.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think there is nothing so admirable as sunsets,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resumed; <div class="bookquote">``but
especially by the side of the sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I adore the sea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Leon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then, does it not seem to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>continued Madame Bovary, <div class="bookquote">``that the
mind travels more freely on this limitless expanse, the contemplation of
which elevates the soul, gives ideas of the infinite, the ideal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the same with mountainous landscapes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>continued Leon. <div class="bookquote">``A cousin
of mine who travelled in Switzerland last year told me that one could
not picture to oneself the poetry of the lakes, the charm of the
waterfalls, the gigantic effect of the glaciers. One sees pines of
incredible size across torrents, cottages suspended over precipices,
and, a thousand feet below one, whole valleys when the clouds open. Such
spectacles must stir to enthusiasm, incline to prayer, to ecstasy; and I
no longer marvel at that celebrated musician who, the better to inspire
his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) imagination, was in the habit of playing the piano before some
imposing site.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You play?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I am very fond of music,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! don't you listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>), Madame Bovary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>interrupted Homais,
bending over his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) plate. <div class="bookquote">``That's sheer modesty. Why, my dear fellow, the
other day in your room you were singing `L’Ange Gardien' ravishingly. I
heard you from the laboratory. You gave it like an actor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div><p/>Leon, in fact, lodged at the chemist's where he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had a small room on the
second floor, overlooking the Place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) blushed at the compliment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
landlord, who had already turned to the doctor, and was enumerating to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), one after the other, all the principal inhabitants of Yonville. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
was telling anecdotes, giving information; the fortune of the notary
was not known exactly, and <div class="bookquote">``there was the Tuvache household,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>who made a
good deal of show.

<p/>Emma continued, <div class="bookquote">``And what music do you prefer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, German music; that which makes you dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been to the opera?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet; but I shall go next year, when I am living at Paris to finish
reading for the bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I had the honour of putting it to your husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist,
<div class="bookquote">``with regard to this poor Yanoda who has run away, you will find
yourself, thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) extravagance, in the possession of one of the
most comfortable houses of Yonville. Its greatest convenience for a
doctor is a door giving on the Walk, where one can go in and out unseen.
Moreover, it contains everything that is agreeable in a household--a
laundry, kitchen with offices, sitting-room, fruit-room, and so on. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
was a gay dog, who didn't care what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spent. At the end of the garden,
by the side of the water, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had an arbour built just for the purpose of
drinking beer in summer; and if madame is fond of gardening she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will be
able--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife doesn't care about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles; <div class="bookquote">``although she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has
been advised to take exercise, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) prefers always sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room
reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>replied Leon. <div class="bookquote">``And indeed, what is better than to sit by
one's fireside in the evening with a book, while the wind beats against
the window and the lamp is burning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) large black eyes wide open upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One thinks of nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``the hours slip by. Motionless we
traverse countries we fancy we see, and your thought, blending with
the fiction, playing with the details, follows the outline of the
adventures. It mingles with the characters, and it seems as if it were
yourself palpitating beneath their costumes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true! That is true?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it ever happened to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>Leon went on, <div class="bookquote">``to come across some vague
idea of one's own in a book, some dim image that comes back to you from
afar, and as the completest expression of your own slightest sentiment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have experienced it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I especially love the poets. I think verse more
tender than prose, and that it moves far more easily to tears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still in the long run it is tiring,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>continued Emma. <div class="bookquote">``Now I, on the
contrary, adore stories that rush breathlessly along, that frighten one.
I detest commonplace heroes and moderate sentiments, such as there are
in nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>observed the clerk, <div class="bookquote">``these works, not touching the heart,
miss, it seems to me, the true end of art. It is so sweet, amid all
the disenchantments of life, to be able to dwell in thought upon noble
characters, pure affections, and pictures of happiness. For myself,
living here far from the world, this is my one distraction; but Yonville
affords so few resources.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like Tostes, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; <div class="bookquote">``and so I always subscribed to a
lending library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If madame will do me the honour of making use of it'' (<font color='red'><b>the chemist Feuilletons the</b></font>)</div>, said the chemist,
who had just caught the last words, <div class="bookquote">``I have at her (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) disposal a library
composed of the best authors, Voltaire, Rousseau, Delille, Walter
Scott, the `Echo des Feuilletons'; and in addition I receive various
periodicals, among them the `Fanal de Rouen' daily, having the advantage
to be its correspondent for the districts of Buchy, Forges, Neufchatel,
Yonville, and vicinity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist Feuilletons the</b></font>)</div><p/>For two hours and a half they had been at table; for the servant
Artemis, carelessly dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) old list slippers over the flags,
brought one plate after the other, forgot everything, and constantly
left the door of the billiard-room half open, so that it beat against
the wall with its hooks.

<p/>Unconsciously, Leon, while talking, had placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) foot on one of the
bars of the chair on which Madame Bovary was sitting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wore a small
blue silk necktie, that kept up like a ruff a gauffered cambric collar,
and with the movements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head the lower part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face gently
sunk into the linen or came out from it. Thus side by side, while
Charles and the chemist chatted, they entered into one of those vague
conversations where the hazard of all that is said brings you back to
the fixed centre of a common sympathy. The Paris theatres, titles of
novels, new quadrilles, and the world they did not know; Tostes, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had lived, and Yonville, where they were; they examined all, talked
of everything till to the end of dinner.

<p/>When coffee was served Felicite went away to get ready the room in the
new house, and the guests soon raised the siege. Madame Lefrancois was
asleep near the cinders, while the stable-boy, lantern in hand, was
waiting to show Monsieur and Madame Bovary the way home. Bits of straw
stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) red hair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) limped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) left leg. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) had
taken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) other hand the cure's umbrella, they started.

<p/>The town was asleep; the pillars of the market threw great shadows; the
earth was all grey as on a summer's night. But as the doctor's house was
only some fifty paces from the inn, they had to say good-night almost
immediately, and the company dispersed.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) entered the passage, Emma felt the cold of the plaster
fall about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulders like damp linen. The walls were new and the
wooden stairs creaked. In their bedroom, on the first floor, a whitish
light passed through the curtainless windows.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could catch glimpses of tree tops, and beyond, the fields,
half-drowned in the fog that lay reeking in the moonlight along
the course of the river. In the middle of the room, pell-mell, were
scattered drawers, bottles, curtain-rods, gilt poles, with mattresses
on the chairs and basins on the ground--the two men who had brought the
furniture had left everything about carelessly.

<p/>This was the fourth time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had slept in a strange place.

<p/>The first was the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) going to the convent; the second, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
arrival at Tostes; the third, at Vaubyessard; and this was the fourth.
And each one had marked, as it were, the inauguration of a new phase in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not believe that things could present themselves in
the same way in different places, and since the portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life
lived had been bad, no doubt that which remained to be lived would be
better.



<p/>Chapter Three

<p/>The next day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was getting up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the clerk on the Place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had on a dressing-gown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked up and bowed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nodded quickly and
reclosed the window.

<p/>Leon waited all day for six o’clock in the evening to come, but on going
to the inn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) found no one but Monsieur Binet, already at table. The
dinner of the evening before had been a considerable event for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
had never till then talked for two hours consecutively to a <div class="bookquote">``lady.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>How
then had he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) been able to explain, and in such language, the number of
things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) could not have said so well before? He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was usually
shy, and maintained that reserve which partakes at once of modesty and
dissimulation.

<p/>At Yonville he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was considered <div class="bookquote">``well-bred.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) listened to the arguments
of the older people, and did not seem hot about politics--a remarkable
thing for a young man. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some accomplishments; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) painted in
water-colours, could read the key of G, and readily talked literature
after dinner when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not play cards. Monsieur Homais respected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) education; Madame Homais liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good-nature, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often took the little Homais into the garden--little brats who were
always dirty, very much spoilt, and somewhat lymphatic, like their
mother. Besides the servant to look after them, they had Justin, the
chemist's apprentice, a second cousin of Monsieur Homais, who had been
taken into the house from charity, and who was useful at the same time
as a servant.

<p/>The druggist proved the best of neighbours. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) gave Madame Bovary
information as to the trades-people, sent expressly for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own cider
merchant, tasted the drink himself, and saw that the casks were properly
placed in the cellar; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) explained how to set about getting in a
supply of butter cheap, and made an arrangement with Lestiboudois, the
sacristan, who, besides his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sacerdotal and funeral functions, looked
after the principal gardens at Yonville by the hour or the year,
according to the taste of the customers.

<p/>The need of looking after others was not the only thing that urged the
chemist to such obsequious cordiality; there was a plan underneath it
all.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) had infringed the law of the 19th Ventose, year xi., article I, which
forbade all persons not having a diploma to practise medicine; so that,
after certain anonymous denunciations, Homais had been summoned to Rouen
to see the procurer of the king in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own private room; the magistrate
receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) standing up, ermine on shoulder and cap on head. It was
in the morning, before the court opened. In the corridors one heard
the heavy boots of the gendarmes walking past, and like a far-off noise
great locks that were shut. The druggist's ears tingled as if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) were
about to have an apoplectic stroke; he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) saw the depths of dungeons,
his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) family in tears, his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shop sold, all the jars dispersed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was
obliged to enter a cafe and take a glass of rum and seltzer to recover
his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) spirits.

<p/>Little by little the memory of this reprimand grew fainter, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) continued, as heretofore, to give anodyne consultations in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
back-parlour. But the mayor resented it, his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) colleagues were jealous,
everything was to be feared; gaining over Monsieur Bovary by his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
attentions was to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) gratitude, and prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) speaking out later
on, should he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) notice anything. So every morning Homais brought him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``the
paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and often in the afternoon left his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shop for a few moments to
have a chat with the Doctor.

<p/>Charles was dull: patients did not come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) remained seated for hours
without speaking, went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) consulting room to sleep, or watched
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife sewing. Then for diversion he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) employed himself at home as a
workman; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) even tried to do up the attic with some paint which had been
left behind by the painters. But money matters worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had
spent so much for repairs at Tostes, for madame's toilette, and for the
moving, that the whole dowry, over three thousand crowns, had slipped
away in two years.

<p/>Then how many things had been spoilt or lost during their carriage from
Tostes to Yonville, without counting the plaster cure, who falling out
of the coach at an over-severe jolt, had been dashed into a thousand
fragments on the pavements of Quincampoix! A pleasanter trouble came
to distract him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), namely, the pregnancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) wife. As the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
confinement approached he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) cherished her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the more. It was another bond of
the flesh establishing itself, and, as it were, a continued sentiment
of a more complex union. When from afar he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) languid walk, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) figure without stays turning softly on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hips; when opposite one
another he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) ease, while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took tired poses in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
armchair, then his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) happiness knew no bounds; he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) got up, embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
passed his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, called her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little mamma, wanted to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dance, and half-laughing, half-crying, uttered all kinds of
caressing pleasantries that came into his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) head. The idea of having
begotten a child delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>). Now he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) wanted nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) knew human
life from end to end, and he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) sat down to it with serenity.

<p/>Emma at first felt a great astonishment; then was anxious to be
delivered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might know what it was to be a mother. But not
being able to spend as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have liked, to have a
swing-bassinette with rose silk curtains, and embroidered caps, in a fit
of bitterness she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave up looking after the trousseau, and ordered the
whole of it from a village needlewoman, without choosing or discussing
anything. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not amuse herself with those preparations that
stimulate the tenderness of mothers, and so her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection was from the
very outset, perhaps, to some extent attenuated.

<p/>As Charles, however, spoke of the boy at every meal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon began to
think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) more consecutively.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped for a son; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would be strong and dark; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would call him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
George; and this idea of having a male child was like an expected
revenge for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) impotence in the past. A man, at least, is free; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
may travel over passions and over countries, overcome obstacles, taste
of the most far-away pleasures. But a woman is always hampered. At once
inert and flexible, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the weakness of the flesh and
legal dependence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will, like the veil of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet, held by a
string, flutters in every wind; there is always some desire that draws
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), some conventionality that restrains.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was confined on a Sunday at about six o’clock, as the sun was
rising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head away and fainted.

<p/>Madame Homais, as well as Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d’Or, almost
immediately came running in to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The chemist, as man of
discretion, only offered a few provincial felicitations through the
half-opened door. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) wished to see the child and thought it well made.

<p/>Whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was getting well she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) occupied herself much in seeking a
name for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter. First she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went over all those that have Italian
endings, such as Clara, Louisa, Amanda, Atala; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) liked Galsuinde
pretty well, and Yseult or Leocadie still better.

<p/>Charles wanted the child to be called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) mother; Emma opposed
this. They ran over the calendar from end to end, and then consulted
outsiders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Leon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist, <div class="bookquote">``with whom I was talking about it
the other day, wonders you do not chose Madeleine. It is very much in
fashion just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>But Madame Bovary, senior, cried out loudly against this name of a
sinner. As to Monsieur Homais, he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) had a preference for all those that
recalled some great man, an illustrious fact, or a generous idea, and it
was on this system that he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) had baptized his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) four children. Thus Napoleon
represented glory and Franklin liberty; Irma was perhaps a concession to
romanticism, but Athalie was a homage to the greatest masterpiece of the
French stage. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) philosophical convictions did not interfere
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) artistic tastes; in him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) the thinker did not stifle the man of
sentiment; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could make distinctions, make allowances for imagination
and fanaticism. In this tragedy, for example, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found fault with the
ideas, but admired the style; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) detested the conception, but applauded
all the details, and loathed the characters while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew enthusiastic
over their dialogue. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read the fine passages he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was transported,
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that mummers would get something out of them for
their show, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was disconsolate; and in this confusion of sentiments in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was involved he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have liked at once to crown Racine with
both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and discuss with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a good quarter of an hour.

<p/>At last Emma remembered that at the chateau of Vaubyessard she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had heard
the Marchioness call a young lady Berthe; from that moment this name was
chosen; and as old Rouault could not come, Monsieur Homais was requested
to stand godfather. His (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) gifts were all products from his (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) establishment,
to wit: six boxes of jujubes, a whole jar of racahout, three cakes of
marshmallow paste, and six sticks of sugar-candy into the bargain that
he (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) had come across in a cupboard. On the evening of the ceremony there
was a grand dinner; the cure was present; there was much excitement.
Monsieur Homais towards liqueur-time began singing <div class="bookquote">``Le Dieu des bonnes
gens.''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>Monsieur Leon sang a barcarolle, and Madame Bovary, senior, who
was godmother, a romance of the time of the Empire; finally, M. Bovary,
senior, insisted on having the child brought down, and began baptizing
it with a glass of champagne that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) poured over its head. This mockery
of the first of the sacraments made the Abbe Bournisien angry; old
Bovary replied by a quotation from <div class="bookquote">``La Guerre des Dieux'' (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>; the cure
wanted to leave; the ladies implored, Homais interfered; and they
succeeded in making the priest sit down again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) quietly went on
with the half-finished coffee in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) saucer.

<p/>Monsieur Bovary, senior, stayed at Yonville a month, dazzling the
natives by a superb policeman's cap with silver tassels that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) wore
in the morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) pipe in the square. Being also in the
habit of drinking a good deal of brandy, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) often sent the servant
to the Lion d’Or to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) a bottle, which was put down to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)
son's account, and to perfume his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) handkerchiefs he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) used up his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)
daughter-in-law's whole supply of eau-de-cologne.

<p/>The latter did not at all dislike his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) company. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had knocked about the
world, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) talked about Berlin, Vienna, and Strasbourg, of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) soldier
times, of the mistresses he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had had, the grand luncheons of which he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had
partaken; then he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was amiable, and sometimes even, either on the stairs,
or in the garden, would seize hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) waist, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Charles, look
out for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Madame Bovary, senior, became alarmed for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) son's happiness, and
fearing that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) husband might in the long-run have an immoral influence
upon the ideas of the young woman, took care to hurry their departure.
Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had more serious reasons for uneasiness. Monsieur Bovary was
not the man to respect anything.

<p/>One day Emma was suddenly seized with the desire to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) little
girl, who had been put to nurse with the carpenter's wife, and, without
looking at the calendar to see whether the six weeks of the Virgin were
yet passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) set out for the Rollets' house, situated at the extreme
end of the village, between the highroad and the fields.

<p/>It was mid-day, the shutters of the houses were closed and the slate
roofs that glittered beneath the fierce light of the blue sky seemed to
strike sparks from the crest of the gables. A heavy wind was blowing;
Emma felt weak as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked; the stones of the pavement hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was doubtful whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not go home again, or go in somewhere to
rest.

<p/>At this moment Monsieur Leon came out from a neighbouring door with a
bundle of papers under his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) came to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and stood in the
shade in front of the Lheureux's shop under the projecting grey awning.

<p/>Madame Bovary said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) baby, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
beginning to grow tired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If--''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon, not daring to go on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any business to attend to?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/>And on the clerk's answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). That same
evening this was known in Yonville, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor's
wife, declared in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) servant that <div class="bookquote">``Madame Bovary was
compromising herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>servant</b></font>)</div><p/>To get to the nurse's it was necessary to turn to the left on leaving
the street, as if making for the cemetery, and to follow between little
houses and yards a small path bordered with privet hedges. They were
in bloom, and so were the speedwells, eglantines, thistles, and the
sweetbriar that sprang up from the thickets. Through openings in
the hedges one could see into the huts, some pigs on a dung-heap, or
tethered cows rubbing their horns against the trunk of trees. The two,
side by side walked slowly, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) leaning upon him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) restraining
his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) pace, which he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) regulated by hers; in front of them a swarm of midges
fluttered, buzzing in the warm air.

<p/>They recognized the house by an old walnut-tree which shaded it.

<p/>Low and covered with brown tiles, there hung outside it, beneath the
dormer-window of the garret, a string of onions. Faggots upright
against a thorn fence surrounded a bed of lettuce, a few square feet of
lavender, and sweet peas strung on sticks. Dirty water was running here
and there on the grass, and all round were several indefinite rags,
knitted stockings, a red calico jacket, and a large sheet of coarse
linen spread over the hedge. At the noise of the gate the nurse appeared
with a baby she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was suckling on one arm. With her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) other hand she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was
pulling along a poor puny little fellow, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face covered with scrofula,
the son of a Rouen hosier, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) parents, too taken up with their
business, left in the country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``your little one is there asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The room on the ground-floor, the only one in the dwelling, had at its
farther end, against the wall, a large bed without curtains, while a
kneading-trough took up the side by the window, one pane of which
was mended with a piece of blue paper. In the corner behind the door,
shining hob-nailed shoes stood in a row under the slab of the washstand,
near a bottle of oil with a feather stuck in its mouth; a Matthieu
Laensberg lay on the dusty mantelpiece amid gunflints, candle-ends, and
bits of amadou.

<p/>Finally, the last luxury in the apartment was a <div class="bookquote">``Fame''  (<font color='red'><b>some perfumer</b></font>)</div>blowing her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
trumpets, a picture cut out, no doubt, from some perfumer's prospectus
and nailed to the wall with six wooden shoe-pegs.

<p/>Emma's child was asleep in a wicker-cradle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took it up in the
wrapping that enveloped it and began singing softly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rocked
herself to and fro.

<p/>Leon walked up and down the room; it seemed strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) to see this
beautiful woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nankeen dress in the midst of all this poverty.
Madam Bovary reddened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) turned away, thinking perhaps there had been
an impertinent look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) eyes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) put back the little girl, who
had just been sick over her (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) collar.

<p/>The nurse at once came to dry her (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>), protesting that it wouldn't show.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Madeleine</b></font>) gives me other doses,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I am always a-washing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madeleine</b></font>). If
you would have the goodness to order Camus, the grocer, to let me have
a little soap, it would really be more convenient for you, as I needn't
trouble you then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Madame Rollet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went out, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoes at the door.

<p/>The good woman accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the end of the garden, talking all the
time of the trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had getting up of nights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm that worn out sometimes as I drop asleep on my chair. I'm sure you
might at least give me just a pound of ground coffee; that'd last me a
month, and I'd take it of a morning with some milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/>After having submitted to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thanks, Madam Bovary left. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) had gone a
little way down the path when, at the sound of wooden shoes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) turned
round. It was the nurse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>peasant</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the peasant woman, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aside behind an elm tree, began
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, who with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trade and six francs a year
that the captain--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, be quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>the nurse went on, heaving sighs between each word, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid
he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll be put out seeing me have coffee alone, you know men--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are to have some,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>Emma repeated; <div class="bookquote">``I will give you some. You
bother me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! my poor, dear lady! you see in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wounds he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
has terrible cramps in the chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) even says that cider weakens him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do make haste, Mere Rollet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the latter continued, making a curtsey, <div class="bookquote">``if it weren't asking
too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) curtsied once more, <div class="bookquote">``if you would'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes
begged--<div class="bookquote">``a jar of brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``and I'd rub your little
one's feet with it; they're as tender as one's tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once rid of the nurse, Emma again took Monsieur Leon's arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked
fast for some time, then more slowly, and looking straight in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes rested on the shoulder of the young man, whose frock-coat
had a black-velvety collar. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brown hair fell over it, straight and
carefully arranged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nails which were longer than one
wore them at Yonville. It was one of the clerk's chief occupations to
trim them, and for this purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) kept a special knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) writing
desk.

<p/>They returned to Yonville by the water-side. In the warm season the
bank, wider than at other times, showed to their foot the garden walls
whence a few steps led to the river. It flowed noiselessly, swift,
and cold to the eye; long, thin grasses huddled together in it as the
current drove them, and spread themselves upon the limpid water like
streaming hair; sometimes at the tip of the reeds or on the leaf of a
water-lily an insect with fine legs crawled or rested. The sun pierced
with a ray the small blue bubbles of the waves that, breaking, followed
each other; branchless old willows mirrored their grey backs in
the water; beyond, all around, the meadows seemed empty. It was the
dinner-hour at the farms, and the young woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companion heard
nothing as they walked but the fall of their steps on the earth of the
path, the words they spoke, and the sound of Emma's dress rustling round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>The walls of the gardens with pieces of bottle on their coping were
hot as the glass windows of a conservatory. Wallflowers had sprung up
between the bricks, and with the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) open sunshade Madame Bovary,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) passed, made some of their faded flowers crumble into a yellow
dust, or a spray of overhanging honeysuckle and clematis caught in its
fringe and dangled for a moment over the silk.

<p/>They were talking of a troupe of Spanish dancers who were expected
shortly at the Rouen theatre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wallflowers</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Had they nothing else to say to one another? Yet their eyes were full
of more serious speech, and while they forced themselves to find trivial
phrases, they felt the same languor stealing over them both. It was the
whisper of the soul, deep, continuous, dominating that of their voices.
Surprised with wonder at this strange sweetness, they did not think of
speaking of the sensation or of seeking its cause. Coming joys, like
tropical shores, throw over the immensity before them their inborn
softness, an odorous wind, and we are lulled by this intoxication
without a thought of the horizon that we do not even know.

<p/>In one place the ground had been trodden down by the cattle; they had to
step on large green stones put here and there in the mud.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) often stopped a moment to look where to place her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) foot, and
tottering on a stone that shook, her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) arms outspread, her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) form bent
forward with a look of indecision, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) would laugh, afraid of falling
into the puddles of water.

<p/>When they arrived in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) garden, Madame Bovary opened the
little gate, ran up the steps and disappeared.

<p/>Leon returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) office. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) chief was away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) just glanced at the
briefs, then cut himself a pen, and at last took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hat and went
out.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went to La Pature at the top of the Argueil hills at the beginning of
the forest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) threw himself upon the ground under the pines and watched
the sky through his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How bored I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``how bored I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was to be pitied for living in this village, with Homais
for a friend and Monsieru Guillaumin for master. The latter, entirely
absorbed by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) business, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles and red
whiskers over a white cravat, understood nothing of mental refinements,
although he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) affected a stiff English manner, which in the beginning had
impressed the clerk.

<p/>As to the chemist's spouse, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was the best wife in Normandy, gentle
as a sheep, loving her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) children, her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) father, her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) cousins,
weeping for other's woes, letting everything go in her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) household, and
detesting corsets; but so slow of movement, such a bore to listen to, so
common in appearance, and of such restricted conversation, that although
she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was thirty, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only twenty, although they slept in rooms next each
other and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) daily, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) might be a
woman for another, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) possessed anything else of her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) sex than
the gown.

<p/>And what else was there? Binet, a few shopkeepers, two or three
publicans, the cure, and finally, Monsieur Tuvache, the mayor, with his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>)
two sons, rich, crabbed, obtuse persons, who farmed their own lands
and had feasts among themselves, bigoted to boot, and quite unbearable
companions.

<p/>But from the general background of all these human faces Emma's stood
out isolated and yet farthest off; for between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) seemed to
see a vague abyss.

<p/>In the beginning he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) had called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) several times along with the
druggist. Charles had not appeared particularly anxious to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
again, and Leon did not know what to do between his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) fear of being
indiscreet and the desire for an intimacy that seemed almost impossible.



<p/>Chapter Four

<p/>When the first cold days set in Emma left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bedroom for the
sitting-room, a long apartment with a low ceiling, in which there was
on the mantelpiece a large bunch of coral spread out against the
looking-glass. Seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm chair near the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could see
the villagers pass along the pavement.

<p/>Twice a day Leon went from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) office to the Lion d’Or. Emma could hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) coming from afar; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leant forward listening, and the young man
glided past the curtain, always dressed in the same way, and without
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. But in the twilight, when, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chin resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
left hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let the embroidery she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had begun fall on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knees, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
often shuddered at the apparition of this shadow suddenly gliding past.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would get up and order the table to be laid.

<p/>Monsieur Homais called at dinner-time. Skull-cap in hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came in on
tiptoe, in order to disturb no one, always repeating the same phrase,
<div class="bookquote">``Good evening, everybody.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat at the table
between the pair, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked the doctor about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patients, and the latter
consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as to the probability of their payment. Next they talked
of <div class="bookquote">``what was in the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Homais by this hour knew it almost by heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated it from end
to end, with the reflections of the penny-a-liners, and all the stories
of individual catastrophes that had occurred in France or abroad. But
the subject becoming exhausted, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not slow in throwing out some
remarks on the dishes before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Sometimes even, half-rising, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) delicately pointed out to madame the
tenderest morsel, or turning to the servant, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) some advice on the
manipulation of stews and the hygiene of seasoning.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) talked aroma, osmazome, juices, and gelatine in a bewildering manner.
Moreover, Homais, with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) head fuller of recipes than his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) shop of jars,
excelled in making all kinds of preserves, vinegars, and sweet liqueurs;
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew also all the latest inventions in economic stoves, together with
the art of preserving cheese and of curing sick wines.

<p/>At eight o’clock Justin came to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) to shut up the shop.

<p/>Then Monsieur Homais gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) a sly look, especially if Felicite was
there, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) half noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) apprentice was fond of the doctor's
house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The young dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is beginning to have ideas, and the devil
take me if I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s in love with your servant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But a more serious fault with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) reproached Justin was his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>)
constantly listening to conversation. On Sunday, for example, one could
not get him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) out of the drawing-room, whither Madame Homais had called
him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) to fetch the children, who were falling asleep in the arm-chairs,
and dragging down with their backs calico chair-covers that were too
large.

<p/>Not many people came to these soirees at the chemist's, his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)
scandal-mongering and political opinions having successfully alienated
various respectable persons from him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>). The clerk never failed to be
there. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) heard the bell he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) ran to meet Madame Bovary, took
her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) shawl, and put away under the shop-counter the thick list shoes that
she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) wore over her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) boots when there was snow.

<p/>First they played some hands at trente-et-un; next Monsieur Homais
played ecarte with Emma; Leon behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) advice.

<p/>Standing up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hands on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chair he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) saw the teeth of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) comb that bit into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chignon. With every movement that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made
to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cards the right side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dress was drawn up. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
turned-up hair a dark colour fell over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back, and growing gradually
paler, lost itself little by little in the shade. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dress fell
on both sides of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chair, puffing out full of folds, and reached the
ground. When Leon occasionally felt the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) boot resting on it,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) drew back as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had trodden upon some one.

<p/>When the game of cards was over, the druggist and the Doctor played
dominoes, and Emma, changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) place, leant her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) elbow on the table,
turning over the leaves of <div class="bookquote">``L’Illustration'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ladies'
journal with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Leon sat down near her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); they looked at the engravings
together, and waited for one another at the bottom of the pages. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
often begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the verses; Leon declaimed them in a
languid voice, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) carefully gave a dying fall in the love
passages. But the noise of the dominoes annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>). Monsieur Homais
was strong at the game; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) could beat Charles and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) a double-six.
Then the three hundred finished, they both stretched themselves out in
front of the fire, and were soon asleep. The fire was dying out in the
cinders; the teapot was empty, Leon was still reading.

<p/>Emma listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), mechanically turning around the lampshade, on the
gauze of which were painted clowns in carriages, and tight-rope dances
with their balancing-poles. Leon stopped, pointing with a gesture to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
sleeping audience; then they talked in low tones, and their conversation
seemed the more sweet to them because it was unheard.

<p/>Thus a kind of bond was established between them, a constant commerce
of books and of romances. Monsieur Bovary, little given to jealousy, did
not trouble himself about it.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) birthday he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) received a beautiful phrenological head, all marked
with figures to the thorax and painted blue. This was an attention of
the clerk's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) many others, even to doing errands for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
at Rouen; and the book of a novelist having made the mania for cactuses
fashionable, Leon bought some for Madame Bovary, bringing them back on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) knees in the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>pricking his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) fingers on their hard hairs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had a board with a balustrade fixed against her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) window to hold the
pots. The clerk, too, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) small hanging garden; they saw each other
tending their flowers at their windows.

<p/>Of the windows of the village there was one yet more often occupied; for
on Sundays from morning to night, and every morning when the weather was
bright, one could see at the dormer-window of the garret the profile of
Monsieur Binet bending over his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) lathe, whose monotonous humming could be
heard at the Lion d’Or.

<p/>One evening on coming home Leon found in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) room a rug in velvet and
wool with leaves on a pale ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) called Madame Homais, Monsieur
Homais, Justin, the children, the cook; he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) spoke of it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) chief;
every one wanted to see this rug. Why did the doctor's wife give the
clerk presents? It looked queer. They decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) must be his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
lover.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made this seem likely, so ceaselessly did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) charms and
of her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) wit; so much so, that Binet once roughly answered him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter to me since I'm not in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) set?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) tortured himself to find out how he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could make his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) declaration to
her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>), and always halting between the fear of displeasing her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) and the
shame of being such a coward, he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) wept with discouragement and desire.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) took energetic resolutions, wrote letters that he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) tore up, put
it off to times that he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) again deferred.

<p/>Often he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) set out with the determination to dare all; but this resolution
soon deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) in Emma's presence, and when Charles, dropping in,
invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to jump into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) chaise to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to see some patient
in the neighbourhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at once accepted, bowed to madame, and went
out. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband, was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) not something belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)? As to Emma,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not ask herself whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) loved. Love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, must come
suddenly, with great outbursts and lightnings--a hurricane of the skies,
which falls upon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a leaf,
and sweeps the whole heart into the abyss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not know that on
the terrace of houses it makes lakes when the pipes are choked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
would thus have remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) security when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suddenly discovered a
rent in the wall of it.



<p/>Chapter Five

<p/>It was a Sunday in February, an afternoon when the snow was falling.

<p/>They had all, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, Homais, and Monsieur Leon,
gone to see a yarn-mill that was being built in the valley a mile and a
half from Yonville. The druggist had taken Napoleon and Athalie to give
them some exercise, and Justin accompanied them, carrying the umbrellas
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>Nothing, however, could be less curious than this curiosity. A great
piece of waste ground, on which pell-mell, amid a mass of sand and
stones, were a few break-wheels, already rusty, surrounded by a
quadrangular building pierced by a number of little windows. The
building was unfinished; the sky could be seen through the joists of the
roofing. Attached to the stop-plank of the gable a bunch of straw mixed
with corn-ears fluttered its tricoloured ribbons in the wind.

<p/>Homais was talking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) explained to the company the future importance
of this establishment, computed the strength of the floorings, the
thickness of the walls, and regretted extremely not having a yard-stick
such as Monsieur Binet possessed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) own special use.

<p/>Emma, who had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) arm, bent lightly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) shoulder, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at the sun's disc shedding afar through the mist his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) pale
splendour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned. Charles was there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cap was drawn down over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyebrows, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) two thick lips were trembling, which added a look
of stupidity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) very back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) calm back, was irritating
to behold, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw written upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) coat all the platitude of the
bearer.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was considering him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thus, tasting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) irritation a sort of
depraved pleasure, Leon made a step forward. The cold that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) pale
seemed to add a more gentle languor to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) face; between his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) cravat and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) neck the somewhat loose collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) shirt showed the skin; the
lobe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) ear looked out from beneath a lock of hair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) large
blue eyes, raised to the clouds, seemed to Emma more limpid and more
beautiful than those mountain-lakes where the heavens are mirrored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wretched boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>suddenly cried the chemist.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) son, who had just precipitated himself into a heap of
lime in order to whiten his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) boots. At the reproaches with which he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) was
being overwhelmed Napoleon began to roar, while Justin dried his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) shoes
with a wisp of straw. But a knife was wanted; Charles offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) carried a knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket like a
peasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The hoar-frost was falling, and they turned back to Yonville.

<p/>In the evening Madame Bovary did not go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neighbour's, and when
Charles had left and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt herself alone, the comparison re-began
with the clearness of a sensation almost actual, and with that
lengthening of perspective which memory gives to things. Looking from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bed at the clean fire that was burning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) still saw, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
down there, Leon standing up with one hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) cane, and with
the other holding Athalie, who was quietly sucking a piece of ice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) charming; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not tear herself away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) other attitudes on other days, the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had spoken, the
sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) whole person; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) repeated, pouting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
lips as if for a kiss--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, charming! charming! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not in love?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked herself; <div class="bookquote">``but
with whom? With me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>All the proofs arose before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at once; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart leapt. The flame of
the fire threw a joyous light upon the ceiling; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back,
stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms.

<p/>Then began the eternal lamentation: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if Heaven had not willed it!
And why not? What prevented it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>When Charles came home at midnight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to have just awakened,
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made a noise undressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) complained of a headache, then
asked carelessly what had happened that evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Leon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) room early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not help smiling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell asleep, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul filled with a
new delight.

<p/>The next day, at dusk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) received a visit from Monsieur Lherueux, the
draper. He (<font color='blue'><b>draper</b></font>) was a man of ability, was this shopkeeper. Born a Gascon but
bred a Norman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) grafted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) southern volubility the cunning of
the Cauchois. His (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) fat, flabby, beardless face seemed dyed by a
decoction of liquorice, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) white hair made even more vivid the
keen brilliance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) small black eyes. No one knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) had been
formerly; a pedlar said some, a banker at Routot according to others.
What was certain was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) made complex calculations in his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) head that
would have frightened Binet himself. Polite to obsequiousness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) always
held himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) back bent in the position of one who bows or who
invites.

<p/>After leaving at the door his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) hat surrounded with crape, he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) put down
a green bandbox on the table, and began by complaining to madame, with
many civilities, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) should have remained till that day without
gaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) confidence. A poor shop like his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) was not made to attract
a <div class="bookquote">``fashionable lady'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) emphasized the words; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) had only to
command, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) would undertake to provide her (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) with anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) might
wish, either in haberdashery or linen, millinery or fancy goods, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) went to town regularly four times a month. He (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) was connected with the
best houses. You could speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) at the <div class="bookquote">``Trois Freres,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>at the <div class="bookquote">``Barbe
d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or at the <div class="bookquote">``Grand Sauvage'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>; all these gentlemen knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) as
well as the insides of their pockets. To-day, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) had come to show
madame, in passing, various articles he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) happened to have, thanks to
the most rare opportunity. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) pulled out half-a-dozen embroidered
collars from the box.

<p/>Madame Bovary examined them. <div class="bookquote">``I do not require anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) said.

<p/>Then Monsieur Lheureux delicately exhibited three Algerian scarves,
several packets of English needles, a pair of straw slippers, and
finally, four eggcups in cocoanut wood, carved in open work by convicts.
Then, with both hands on the table, his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) neck stretched out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) figure
bent forward, open-mouthed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) watched Emma's look, who was walking up
and down undecided amid these goods. From time to time, as if to remove
some dust, he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) filliped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) nail the silk of the scarves spread
out at full length, and they rustled with a little noise, making in the
green twilight the gold spangles of their tissue scintillate like little
stars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A mere nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``a mere nothing. But there's no hurry;
whenever it's convenient. We are not Jews.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reflected for a few moments, and ended by again declining Monsieur
Lheureux's offer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) replied quite unconcernedly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. We shall understand one another by and by. I have always got
on with ladies--if I didn't with my own!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) went on good-naturedly, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) joke, <div class="bookquote">``that
it isn't the money I should trouble about. Why, I could give you some,
if need be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made a gesture of surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) quickly and in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have to go far to
find you some, rely on that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) began asking after Pere Tellier, the proprietor of the <div class="bookquote">``Cafe
Francais,''  (<font color='red'><b>the proprietor</b></font>)</div>whom Monsieur Bovary was then attending.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with Pere Tellier? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) coughs so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>)
whole house, and I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>)'ll soon want a deal covering rather than
a flannel vest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) was such a rake as a young man! Those sort of people,
madame, have not the least regularity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>)'s burnt up with brandy. Still
it's sad, all the same, to see an acquaintance go off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And while he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) fastened up his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) box he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) discoursed about the doctor's
patients.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the weather, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) said, looking frowningly at the floor,
<div class="bookquote">``that causes these illnesses. I, too, don't feel the thing. One of these
days I shall even have to consult the doctor for a pain I have in my
back. Well, good-bye, Madame Bovary. At your service; your very humble
servant.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) closed the door gently.

<p/>Emma had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dinner served in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bedroom on a tray by the fireside; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was a long time over it; everything was well with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How good I was!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to herself, thinking of the scarves.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard some steps on the stairs. It was Leon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) got up and took
from the chest of drawers the first pile of dusters to be hemmed. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) came in she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed very busy.

<p/>The conversation languished; Madame Bovary gave it up every few minutes,
whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) himself seemed quite embarrassed. Seated on a low chair near
the fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) turned round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) fingers the ivory thimble-case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
stitched on, or from time to time turned down the hem of the cloth with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nail. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not speak; he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) was silent, captivated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) silence,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) would have been by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How have I displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) asked himself.

<p/>At last, however, Leon said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) should have, one of these days, to
go to Rouen on some office business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your music subscription is out; am I to renew it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And pursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) slowly drew a long stitch of grey thread.

<p/>This work irritated Leon. It seemed to roughen the ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fingers.
A gallant phrase came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) head, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) did not risk it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are giving it up?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``Music? Ah! yes! Have I not my house to
look after, my husband to attend to, a thousand things, in fact, many
duties that must be considered first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at the clock. Charles was late. Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affected anxiety.
Two or three times she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even repeated, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is so good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The clerk was fond of Monsieur Bovary. But this tenderness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) behalf
astonished him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) unpleasantly; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) praises,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said everyone was singing, especially the chemist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is a good fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>continued Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>replied the clerk.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) began talking of Madame Homais, whose very untidy appearance
generally made them laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>interrupted Emma. <div class="bookquote">``A good housewife does not
trouble about her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) appearance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) relapsed into silence.

<p/>It was the same on the following days; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talks, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) manners,
everything changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took interest in the housework, went to church
regularly, and looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) servant with more severity.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took Berthe from nurse. When visitors called, Felicite brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
in, and Madame Bovary undressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to show off her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) limbs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) declared
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) adored children; this was her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) consolation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) joy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) passion,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caresses with lyrical outburst which would have
reminded anyone but the Yonville people of Sachette in <div class="bookquote">``Notre Dame de
Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>When Charles came home he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) slippers put to warm near the fire.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) waistcoat now never wanted lining, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shirt buttons, and it was
quite a pleasure to see in the cupboard the night-caps arranged in piles
of the same height. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) no longer grumbled as formerly at taking a turn
in the garden; what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) proposed was always done, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not
understand the wishes to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) submitted without a murmur; and when
Leon saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) fireside after dinner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) two hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) stomach,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) two feet on the fender, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) two cheeks red with feeding, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) eyes
moist with happiness, the child crawling along the carpet, and this
woman with the slender waist who came behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) arm-chair to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
forehead: <div class="bookquote">``What madness!''  (<font color='red'><b>this woman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) said to himself. <div class="bookquote">``And how to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And thus she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed so virtuous and inaccessible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) lost all
hope, even the faintest. But by this renunciation he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) placed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on
an extraordinary pinnacle. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood outside those fleshly
attributes from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had nothing to obtain, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
rose ever, and became farther removed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) after the magnificent
manner of an apotheosis that is taking wing. It was one of those pure
feelings that do not interfere with life, that are cultivated because
they are rare, and whose loss would afflict more than their passion
rejoices.

<p/>Emma grew thinner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheeks paler, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face longer. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) black
hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) large eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aquiline nose, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) birdlike walk, and always
silent now, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not seem to be passing through life scarcely
touching it, and to bear on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brow the vague impress of some divine
destiny? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so sad and so calm, at once so gentle and so reserved,
that near her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) one felt oneself seized by an icy charm, as we shudder
in churches at the perfume of the flowers mingling with the cold of the
marble. The others even did not escape from this seduction. The chemist
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) is a woman of great parts, who wouldn't be misplaced in a
sub-prefecture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>The housewives admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) economy, the patients her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) politeness, the
poor her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) charity.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was eaten up with desires, with rage, with hate. That dress with
the narrow folds hid a distracted fear, of whose torment those chaste
lips said nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was in love with Leon, and sought solitude that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might with the more ease delight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) image. The sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
form troubled the voluptuousness of this mediation. Emma thrilled at
the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) step; then in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) presence the emotion subsided, and
afterwards there remained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only an immense astonishment that ended
in sorrow.

<p/>Leon did not know that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in despair she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rose after he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had
gone to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) in the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) concerned herself about his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) comings
and goings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) face; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) invented quite a history to find
an excuse for going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) room. The chemist's wife seemed happy to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
to sleep under the same roof, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thoughts constantly centered upon
this house, like the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or''  (<font color='red'><b>chemist wife</b></font>)</div>pigeons, who came there to dip their
red feet and white wings in its gutters. But the more Emma recognised
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) love, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) crushed it down, that it might not be evident,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might make it less. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have liked Leon to guess it, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagined chances, catastrophes that should facilitate this.

<p/>What restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was, no doubt, idleness and fear, and a sense of
shame also. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had repulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) too much, that the time was
past, that all was lost. Then, pride, and joy of being able to say to
herself, <div class="bookquote">``I am virtuous,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and to look at herself in the glass taking
resigned poses, consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a little for the sacrifice she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was making.

<p/>Then the lusts of the flesh, the longing for money, and the melancholy
of passion all blended themselves into one suffering, and instead of
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts from it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) clave to it the more, urging herself
to pain, and seeking everywhere occasion for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was irritated by
an ill-served dish or by a half-open door; bewailed the velvets she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
not, the happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had missed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) too exalted dreams, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) narrow
home.

<p/>What exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was that Charles did not seem to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
anguish. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) happy seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) an
imbecile insult, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sureness on this point ingratitude. For whose
sake, then was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) virtuous? Was it not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), the obstacle to all
felicity, the cause of all misery, and, as it were, the sharp clasp of
that complex strap that bucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in on all sides.

<p/>On him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) alone, then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) concentrated all the various hatreds that
resulted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) boredom, and every effort to diminish only augmented
it; for this useless trouble was added to the other reasons for despair,
and contributed still more to the separation between them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own
gentleness to herself made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rebel against him (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>). Domestic mediocrity
drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to lewd fancies, marriage tenderness to adulterous desires.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have liked Charles to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might have a better
right to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), to revenge herself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was surprised
sometimes at the atrocious conjectures that came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to go on smiling, to hear repeated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at all hours that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was happy, to pretend to be happy, to let it be believed.

<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had loathing of this hypocrisy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was seized with the
temptation to flee somewhere with Leon to try a new life; but at once a
vague chasm full of darkness opened within her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no longer loves me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``What is to become of me?
What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was left broken, breathless, inert, sobbing in a low voice, with
flowing tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you tell master?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the servant asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) came in
during these crises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the nerves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``Do not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) of it; it would
worry him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Felicite went on, <div class="bookquote">``you are just like La Guerine, Pere
Guerin's daughter, the fisherman at Pollet, that I used to know at
Dieppe before I came to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was so sad, so sad, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
standing upright on the threshold of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) house, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) seemed to you like a
winding-sheet spread out before the door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) illness, it appears, was
a kind of fog that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head, and the doctors could not do
anything, nor the priest either. When she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was taken too bad she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went
off quite alone to the sea-shore, so that the customs officer, going his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
rounds, often found her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lying flat on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) face, crying on the shingle.
Then, after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marriage, it went off, they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, <div class="bookquote">``it was after marriage that it began.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter Six

<p/>One evening when the window was open, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), sitting by it, had been
watching Lestiboudois, the beadle, trimming the box, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suddenly heard
the Angelus ringing.

<p/>It was the beginning of April, when the primroses are in bloom, and a
warm wind blows over the flower-beds newly turned, and the gardens, like
women, seem to be getting ready for the summer fetes. Through the bars
of the arbour and away beyond the river seen in the fields, meandering
through the grass in wandering curves. The evening vapours rose between
the leafless poplars, touching their outlines with a violet tint, paler
and more transparent than a subtle gauze caught athwart their branches.
In the distance cattle moved about; neither their steps nor their lowing
could be heard; and the bell, still ringing through the air, kept up its
peaceful lamentation.

<p/>With this repeated tinkling the thoughts of the young woman lost
themselves in old memories of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) youth and school-days. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remembered
the great candlesticks that rose above the vases full of flowers on the
altar, and the tabernacle with its small columns. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have liked
to be once more lost in the long line of white veils, marked off here
and there by the stuff black hoods of the good sisters bending over
their prie-Dieu. At mass on Sundays, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked up, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw the
gentle face of the Virgin amid the blue smoke of the rising incense.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was moved; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt herself weak and quite deserted, like the
down of a bird whirled by the tempest, and it was unconsciously that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
went towards the church, included to no matter what devotions, so that
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul was absorbed and all existence lost in it.

<p/>On the Place she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) met Lestivoudois on his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way back, for, in order not
to shorten his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) day's labour, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) preferred interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work,
then beginning it again, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rang the Angelus to suit his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
convenience. Besides, the ringing over a little earlier warned the lads
of catechism hour.

<p/>Already a few who had arrived were playing marbles on the stones of the
cemetery. Others, astride the wall, swung their legs, kicking with their
clogs the large nettles growing between the little enclosure and the
newest graves. This was the only green spot. All the rest was but
stones, always covered with a fine powder, despite the vestry-broom.

<p/>The children in list shoes ran about there as if it were an enclosure
made for them. The shouts of their voices could be heard through the
humming of the bell. This grew less and less with the swinging of the
great rope that, hanging from the top of the belfry, dragged its end on
the ground. Swallows flitted to and fro uttering little cries, cut the
air with the edge of their wings, and swiftly returned to their yellow
nests under the tiles of the coping. At the end of the church a lamp was
burning, the wick of a night-light in a glass hung up. Its light from a
distance looked like a white stain trembling in the oil. A long ray of
the sun fell across the nave and seemed to darken the lower sides and
the corners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the cure?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>asked Madame Bovary of one of the lads, who was
amusing himself by shaking a swivel in a hole too large for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is just coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) answered.

<p/>And in fact the door of the presbytery grated; Abbe Bournisien appeared;
the children, pell-mell, fled into the church.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These young scamps!''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>murmured the priest, <div class="bookquote">``always the same!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, picking up a catechism all in rags that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had struck with is
foot, <div class="bookquote">``They respect nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) caught sight of Madame
Bovary, <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I did not recognise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) thrust the catechism into his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) pocket, and stopped short, balancing
the heavy vestry key between his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) two fingers.

<p/>The light of the setting sun that fell full upon his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) face paled the
lasting of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) cassock, shiny at the elbows, unravelled at the hem.
Grease and tobacco stains followed along his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) broad chest the lines
of the buttons, and grew more numerous the farther they were from his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
neckcloth, in which the massive folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) red chin rested; this was
dotted with yellow spots, that disappeared beneath the coarse hair of
his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) greyish beard. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had just dined and was breathing noisily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; <div class="bookquote">``I am ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and so am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>answered the priest. <div class="bookquote">``These first warm days weaken
one most remarkably, don't they? But, after all, we are born to suffer,
as St. Paul says. But what does Monsieur Bovary think of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said with a gesture of contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>replied the good fellow, quite astonished, <div class="bookquote">``doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) prescribe
something for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``it is no earthly remedy I need.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>But the cure from time to time looked into the church, where the
kneeling boys were shouldering one another, and tumbling over like packs
of cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look out, Riboudet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>cried the priest in an angry voice; <div class="bookquote">``I'll warm
your ears, you imp!''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>Then turning to Emma, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'s Boudet the carpenter's
son; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) parents are well off, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) do just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pleases. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
could learn quickly if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is very sharp. And so sometimes
for a joke I call him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) Riboudet -LRB-like the road one takes to go to
Maromme-RRB- and I even say `Mon Riboudet.' Ha! Ha! `Mont Riboudet.' The
other day I repeated that just to Monsignor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) laughed at it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>)
condescended to laugh at it. And how is Monsieur Bovary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always very busy, no doubt; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) and I are certainly the busiest
people in the parish. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) is doctor of the body,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) added with a
thick laugh, <div class="bookquote">``and I of the soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pleading eyes upon the priest. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you
solace all sorrows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! don't talk to me of it, Madame Bovary. This morning I had to go to
Bas-Diauville for a cow that was ill; they thought it was under a spell.
All their cows, I don't know how it is--But pardon me! Longuemarre and
Boudet! Bless me! Will you leave off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with a bound he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) ran into the church.

<p/>The boys were just then clustering round the large desk, climbing over
the precentor's footstool, opening the missal; and others on tiptoe were
just about to venture into the confessional. But the priest suddenly
distributed a shower of cuffs among them. Seizing them by the collars of
their coats, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) lifted them from the ground, and deposited them on their
knees on the stones of the choir, firmly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) meant planting them
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) returned to Emma, unfolding his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) large cotton
handkerchief, one corner of which he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) put between his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">``farmers are
much to be pitied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Others, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly. Town-labourers, for example.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not they--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon! I've there known poor mothers of families, virtuous women, I
assure you, real saints, who wanted even bread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But those,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, and the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth twitched as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
spoke, <div class="bookquote">``those, Monsieur le Cure, who have bread and have no--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fire in the winter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the priest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what does that matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! What does it matter? It seems to me that when one has firing and
food--for, after all--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My God! my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is indigestion, no doubt? You must get home, Madame Bovary; drink
a little tea, that will strengthen you, or else a glass of fresh water
with a little moist sugar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked like one awaking from a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see, you were putting your hand to your forehead. I thought
you felt faint.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then, bethinking himself, <div class="bookquote">``But you were asking me
something? What was it? I really don't remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? Nothing! nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>repeated Emma.

<p/>And the glance she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cast round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) slowly fell upon the old man in the
cassock. They looked at one another face to face without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Madame Bovary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``excuse me, but duty first, you

soon be upon us, and I fear we shall be behind after all. So after
Ascension Day I keep them recta* an extra hour every Wednesday. Poor
children! One cannot lead them too soon into the path of the Lord, as,
moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has himself recommended us to do by the mouth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Divine
Son. Good health to you, madame; my respects to your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>*On the straight and narrow path.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into the church making a genuflexion as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached
the door.

<p/>Emma saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disappear between the double row of forms, walking with a
heavy tread, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head a little bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two
hands half-open behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heel all of one piece, like a statue on a pivot,
and went homewards. But the loud voice of the priest, the clear voices
of the boys still reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ears, and went on behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you a Christian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am a Christian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is a Christian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) who, being baptized-baptized-baptized--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went up the steps of the staircase holding on to the banisters, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room threw herself into an arm-chair.

<p/>The whitish light of the window-panes fell with soft undulations.

<p/>The furniture in its place seemed to have become more immobile, and to
lose itself in the shadow as in an ocean of darkness. The fire was out,
the clock went on ticking, and Emma vaguely marvelled at this calm of
all things while within herself was such tumult. But little Berthe was
there, between the window and the work-table, tottering on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knitted
shoes, and trying to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother to catch hold of the ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
apron-strings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand.

<p/>The little girl soon came up closer against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knees, and leaning on
them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) large blue eyes, while a
small thread of pure saliva dribbled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips on to the silk apron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>repeated the young woman quite irritably.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face frightened the child, who began to scream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you leave me alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) elbow.

<p/>Berthe fell at the foot of the drawers against the brass handle, cutting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheek, which began to bleed, against it. Madame Bovary sprang to
lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) up, broke the bell-rope, called for the servant with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
might, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was just going to curse herself when Charles appeared. It
was the dinner-hour; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had come home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma, in a calm voice, <div class="bookquote">``the little one fell down
while she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was playing, and has hurt herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); the case was not a serious one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went for
some sticking plaster.

<p/>Madame Bovary did not go downstairs to the dining-room; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished
to remain alone to look after the child. Then watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sleep, the
little anxiety she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt gradually wore off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed very stupid
to herself, and very good to have been so worried just now at so little.
Berthe, in fact, no longer sobbed.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breathing now imperceptibly raised the cotton covering. Big tears
lay in the corner of the half-closed eyelids, through whose lashes one
could see two pale sunken pupils; the plaster stuck on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheek drew
the skin obliquely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>thought Emma, <div class="bookquote">``how ugly this child is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>When at eleven o’clock Charles came back from the chemist's shop,
whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had gone after dinner to return the remainder of the
sticking-plaster, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife standing by the cradle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you it's nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) on the forehead.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, my poor darling; you will make yourself ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had stayed a long time at the chemist's. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not seemed
much moved, Homais, nevertheless, had exerted himself to buoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) up, to
<div class="bookquote">``keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) spirits.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then they had talked of the various dangers that
threaten childhood, of the carelessness of servants. Madame Homais knew
something of it, having still upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chest the marks left by a basin
full of soup that a cook had formerly dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pinafore, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) good parents took no end of trouble for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The knives were not
sharpened, nor the floors waxed; there were iron gratings to the windows
and strong bars across the fireplace; the little Homais, in spite of
their spirit, could not stir without someone watching them; at the
slightest cold their father stuffed them with pectorals; and until
they were turned four they all, without pity, had to wear wadded
head-protectors. This, it is true, was a fancy of Madame Homais'; her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband was inwardly afflicted at it. Fearing the possible consequences
of such compression to the intellectual organs. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) even went so far as
to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to make Caribs or Botocudos of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles, however, had several times tried to interrupt the conversation.
<div class="bookquote">``I should like to speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had whispered in the clerk's ear,
who went upstairs in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) suspect anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>Leon asked himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) heart beat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
racked his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) brain with surmises.

<p/>At last, Charles, having shut the door, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to see himself
what would be the price at Rouen of a fine daguerreotypes. It was a
sentimental surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) intended for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife, a delicate attention--his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
portrait in a frock-coat. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted first to know <div class="bookquote">``how much it would
be.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The inquiries would not put Monsieur Leon out, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went to
town almost every week.

<p/>Why? Monsieur Homais suspected some <div class="bookquote">``young man's affair''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>at the bottom
of it, an intrigue. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was mistaken. Leon was after no love-making.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was sadder than ever, as Madame Lefrancois saw from the amount of
food he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) left on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) plate. To find out more about it she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) questioned
the tax-collector. Binet answered roughly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``wasn't paid by the
police.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All the same, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) companion seemed very strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>), for Leon often
threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) chair, and stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) arms, complained vaguely of life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's because you don't take enough recreation,''  (<font color='red'><b>the collector</b></font>)</div>said the collector.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What recreation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were you I'd have a lathe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't know how to turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>answered the clerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said the other, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>) chin with an air of
mingled contempt and satisfaction.

<p/>Leon was weary of loving without any result; moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was beginning
to feel that depression caused by the repetition of the same kind of
life, when no interest inspires and no hope sustains it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was so bored
with Yonville and its inhabitants, that the sight of certain persons,
of certain houses, irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) beyond endurance; and the chemist, good
fellow though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was, was becoming absolutely unbearable to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Yet
the prospect of a new condition of life frightened as much as it seduced
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).

<p/>This apprehension soon changed into impatience, and then Paris from afar
sounded its fanfare of masked balls with the laugh of grisettes. As he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
was to finish reading there, why not set out at once? What prevented
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) began making home-preparations; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) occupations
beforehand. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) furnished in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head an apartment. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would lead an
artist's life there! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would take lessons on the guitar! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would have
a dressing-gown, a Basque cap, blue velvet slippers! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) even already was
admiring two crossed foils over his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chimney-piece, with a death's head
on the guitar above them.

<p/>The difficulty was the consent of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother; nothing, however, seemed
more reasonable. Even his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) employer advised him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to go to some other
chambers where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could advance more rapidly. Taking a middle course,
then, Leon looked for some place as second clerk at Rouen; found none,
and at last wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mother a long letter full of details, in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) set forth the reasons for going to live at Paris immediately. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
consented.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) did not hurry. Every day for a month Hivert carried boxes, valises,
parcels for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) from Yonville to Rouen and from Rouen to Yonville;
and when Leon had packed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) wardrobe, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) three arm-chairs
restuffed, bought a stock of neckties, in a word, had made more
preparations than for a voyage around the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) put it off from week
to week, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) received a second letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mother urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) to
leave, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) wanted to pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) examination before the vacation.

<p/>When the moment for the farewells had come, Madame Homais wept, Justin
sobbed; Homais, as a man of nerve, concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) emotion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) wished to
carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) friend's overcoat himself as far as the gate of the notary,
who was taking Leon to Rouen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) carriage.

<p/>The latter had just time to bid farewell to Monsieur Bovary.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) reached the head of the stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was so out of
breath. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) came in, Madame Bovary arose hurriedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sure of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) lips, and a rush of blood flowing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) skin made her (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>)
red from the roots of her (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) hair to the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) collar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) remained
standing, leaning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) shoulder against the wainscot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor is not here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is out.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Homais</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was silence. They looked at one another and their thoughts,
confounded in the same agony, clung close together like two throbbing
breasts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to kiss Berthe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon.

<p/>Emma went down a few steps and called Felicite.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) threw one long look around him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) that took in the walls, the
decorations, the fireplace, as if to penetrate everything, carry away
everything. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) returned, and the servant brought Berthe, who was
swinging a windmill roof downwards at the end of a string. Leon kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) several times on the neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, poor child! good-bye, dear little one! good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/>They remained alone--Madame Bovary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back turned, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face pressed
against a window-pane; Leon held his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hand, knocking it softly
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) thigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is going to rain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a cloak,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned around, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chin lowered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forehead bent forward.

<p/>The light fell on it as on a piece of marble, to the curve of the
eyebrows, without one's being able to guess what Emma was seeing on the
horizon or what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was thinking within herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) sighed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head with a quick movement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, good-bye--go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They advanced towards each other; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the English fashion, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own hand wholly to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), and forcing a laugh.

<p/>Leon felt it between his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) fingers, and the very essence of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) being
seemed to pass down into that moist palm. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hand; their
eyes met again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) disappeared.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) reached the market-place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) stopped and hid behind a pillar to
look for the last time at this white house with the four green blinds.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) saw a shadow behind the window in the room; but the
curtain, sliding along the pole as though no one were touching it,
slowly opened its long oblique folds that spread out with a single
movement, and thus hung straight and motionless as a plaster wall. Leon
set off running.

<p/>From afar he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) employer's gig in the road, and by it a man in
a coarse apron holding the horse. Homais and Monsieur Guillaumin were
talking. They were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Embrace me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>said the druggist with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Here is your
coat, my good friend. Mind the cold; take care of yourself; look after
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Leon, jump in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said the notary.

<p/>Homais bent over the splash-board, and in a voice broken by sobs uttered
these three sad words--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pleasant journey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Guillaumin</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Guillaumin. <div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) head.''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>They set
out, and Homais went back.

<p/>Madame Bovary had opened her (<font color='blue'><b>druggist</b></font>) window overlooking the garden and watched
the clouds. They gathered around the sunset on the side of Rouen and
then swiftly rolled back their black columns, behind which the great
rays of the sun looked out like the golden arrows of a suspended trophy,
while the rest of the empty heavens was white as porcelain. But a gust
of wind bowed the poplars, and suddenly the rain fell; it pattered
against the green leaves.

<p/>Then the sun reappeared, the hens clucked, sparrows shook their wings in
the damp thickets, and the pools of water on the gravel as they flowed
away carried off the pink flowers of an acacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! how far off he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) must be already!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) thought.

<p/>Monsieur Homais, as usual, came at half-past six during dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``so we've sent off our young friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it seems,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor. Then turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) chair; <div class="bookquote">``Any news
at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing much. Only my wife was a little moved this afternoon. You know
women--a nothing upsets them, especially my wife. And we should be
wrong to object to that, since their nervous organization is much more
malleable than ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Leon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``How will he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) live at Paris? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) get used
to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Bovary sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``The outings at
restaurants, the masked balls, the champagne--all that'll be jolly
enough, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)'ll go wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>objected Bovary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Homais quickly; <div class="bookquote">``although he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)'ll have to do
like the rest for fear of passing for a Jesuit. And you don't know what
a life those dogs lead in the Latin quarter with actresses. Besides,
students are thought a great deal of in Paris. Provided they have a few
accomplishments, they are received in the best society; there are even
ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain who fall in love with them, which
subsequently furnishes them opportunities for making very good matches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">``I fear for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) that down there--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>interrupted the chemist; ``that is the reverse of the
medal. And one is constantly obliged to keep one's hand in one's pocket
there. Thus, we will suppose you are in a public garden. An individual
presents himself, well dressed, even wearing an order, and whom one
would take for a diplomatist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) approaches you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) insinuates himself;
offers you a pinch of snuff, or picks up your hat. Then you become more
intimate; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) takes you to a cafe, invites you to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) country-house,
introduces you, between two drinks, to all sorts of people; and
three-fourths of the time it's only to plunder your watch or lead you
into some pernicious step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles; <div class="bookquote">``but I was thinking especially of
illnesses--of typhoid fever, for example, that attacks students from the
provinces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma shuddered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of the change of regimen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>continued the chemist, <div class="bookquote">``and of the
perturbation that results therefrom in the whole system. And then the
water at Paris, don't you know! The dishes at restaurants, all the
spiced food, end by heating the blood, and are not worth, whatever
people may say of them, a good soup. For my own part, I have always
preferred plain living; it is more healthy. So when I was studying
pharmacy at Rouen, I boarded in a boarding house; I dined with the
professors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>And thus he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) went on, expounding his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) opinions generally and his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) personal
likings, until Justin came to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) for a mulled egg that was
wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a moment's peace!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``always at it! I can't go out for a
minute! Like a plough-horse, I have always to be moiling and toiling.
What drudgery!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) was at the door, <div class="bookquote">``By the way, do you know
the news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That it is very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>Homais went on, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) eyebrows and
assuming one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) most serious expression, <div class="bookquote">``that the agricultural
meeting of the Seine-Inferieure will be held this year at
Yonville-l’Abbaye. The rumour, at all events, is going the round. This
morning the paper alluded to it. It would be of the utmost importance
for our district. But we'll talk it over later on. I can see, thank you;
Justin has the lantern.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter Seven

<p/>The next day was a dreary one for Emma. Everything seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
enveloped in a black atmosphere floating confusedly over the exterior of
things, and sorrow was engulfed within her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul with soft shrieks such
as the winter wind makes in ruined castles. It was that reverie which we
give to things that will not return, the lassitude that seizes you after
everything was done; that pain, in fine, that the interruption of every
wonted movement, the sudden cessation of any prolonged vibration, brings
on.

<p/>As on the return from Vaubyessard, when the quadrilles were running in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was full of a gloomy melancholy, of a numb despair.
Leon reappeared, taller, handsomer, more charming, more vague. Though
separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had not left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was there, and the walls of
the house seemed to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) shadow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not detach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes from the carpet where he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had walked, from
those empty chairs where he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had sat. The river still flowed on, and
slowly drove its ripples along the slippery banks.

<p/>They had often walked there to the murmur of the waves over the
moss-covered pebbles. How bright the sun had been! What happy afternoons
they had seen alone in the shade at the end of the garden! He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) read
aloud, bareheaded, sitting on a footstool of dry sticks; the fresh wind
of the meadow set trembling the leaves of the book and the nasturtiums
of the arbour. Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was gone, the only charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) life, the only
possible hope of joy. Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) not seized this happiness when it came
to her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)? Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees,
when it was about to flee from her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)? And she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) cursed herself for not
having loved Leon. She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) thirsted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) lips. The wish took possession
of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) to run after and rejoin him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), throw herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) arms and
say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It is I; I am yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But Emma recoiled beforehand at the
difficulties of the enterprise, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) desires, increased by regret,
became only the more acute.

<p/>Henceforth the memory of Leon was the centre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) boredom; it burnt
there more brightly than the fire travellers have left on the snow of
a Russian steppe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sprang towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pressed against him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
stirred carefully the dying embers, sought all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) anything
that could revive it; and the most distant reminiscences, like the most
immediate occasions, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) experienced as well as what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagined,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voluptuous desires that were unsatisfied, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) projects of happiness
that crackled in the wind like dead boughs, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sterile virtue, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
lost hopes, the domestic tete-a-tete--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gathered it all up, took
everything, and made it all serve as fuel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) melancholy.

<p/>The flames, however, subsided, either because the supply had exhausted
itself, or because it had been piled up too much. Love, little by
little, was quelled by absence; regret stifled beneath habit; and this
incendiary light that had empurpled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pale sky was overspread and
faded by degrees. In the supineness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) conscience she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
repugnance towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband for aspirations towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lover, the
burning of hate for the warmth of tenderness; but as the tempest still
raged, and as passion burnt itself down to the very cinders, and no help
came, no sun rose, there was night on all sides, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was lost in the
terrible cold that pierced her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>Then the evil days of Tostes began again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought herself now far
more unhappy; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the experience of grief, with the certainty
that it would not end.

<p/>A woman who had laid on herself such sacrifices could well allow herself
certain whims. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bought a Gothic prie-dieu, and in a month spent
fourteen francs on lemons for polishing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nails; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrote to Rouen
for a blue cashmere gown; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chose one of Lheureux's finest scarves,
and wore it knotted around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waist over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dressing-gown; and, with
closed blinds and a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lay stretched out on a couch
in this garb.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) often changed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coiffure; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair a la Chinoise, in
flowing curls, in plaited coils; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) parted in on one side and rolled it
under like a man's.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted to learn Italian; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bought dictionaries, a grammar, and
a supply of white paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried serious reading, history, and
philosophy. Sometimes in the night Charles woke up with a start,
thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was being called to a patient. <div class="bookquote">``I'm coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stammered;
and it was the noise of a match Emma had struck to relight the lamp. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reading fared like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) piece of embroidery, all of which, only just
begun, filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cupboard; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took it up, left it, passed on to other
books.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had attacks in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could easily have been driven to commit any
folly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) maintained one day, in opposition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
could drink off a large glass of brandy, and, as Charles was stupid
enough to dare her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) swallowed the brandy to the last drop.

<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) vapourish airs -LRB-as the housewives of Yonville called
them-RRB-, Emma, all the same, never seemed gay, and usually she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had at the
corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth that immobile contraction that puckers the faces of
old maids, and those of men whose ambition has failed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was pale all
over, white as a sheet; the skin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nose was drawn at the nostrils,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes looked at you vaguely. After discovering three grey hairs on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) temples, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talked much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) old age.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) often fainted. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even spat blood, and, as Charles fussed
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) anxiety--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``what does it matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles fled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) study and wept there, both his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) elbows on the table,
sitting in an arm-chair at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bureau under the phrenological head.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother begging her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to come, and they had many long
consultations together on the subject of Emma.

<p/>What should they decide? What was to be done since she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rejected all
medical treatment? <div class="bookquote">``Do you know what your wife wants?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>replied Madame
Bovary senior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wants to be forced to occupy herself with some manual work. If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
were obliged, like so many others, to earn her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) living, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wouldn't have
these vapours, that come to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from a lot of ideas she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stuffs into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
head, and from the idleness in which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is always busy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! always busy at what? Reading novels, bad books, works against
religion, and in which they mock at priests in speeches taken from
Voltaire. But all that leads you far astray, my poor child. Anyone who
has no religion always ends by turning out badly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>So it was decided to stop Emma reading novels. The enterprise did not
seem easy. The good lady undertook it. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed through
Rouen, to go herself to the lending-library and represent that Emma had
discontinued her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) subscription. Would they not have a right to apply
to the police if the librarian persisted all the same in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) poisonous
trade? The farewells of mother and daughter-in-law were cold. During
the three weeks that they had been together they had not exchanged
half-a-dozen words apart from the inquiries and phrases when they met at
table and in the evening before going to bed.

<p/>Madame Bovary left on a Wednesday, the market-day at Yonville.

<p/>The Place since morning had been blocked by a row of carts, which, on
end and their shafts in the air, spread all along the line of houses
from the church to the inn. On the other side there were canvas booths,
where cotton checks, blankets, and woollen stockings were sold,
together with harness for horses, and packets of blue ribbon, whose ends
fluttered in the wind. The coarse hardware was spread out on the ground
between pyramids of eggs and hampers of cheeses, from which sticky straw
stuck out.

<p/>Near the corn-machines clucking hens passed their necks through the bars
of flat cages. The people, crowding in the same place and unwilling
to move thence, sometimes threatened to smash the shop front of the
chemist. On Wednesdays his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) shop was never empty, and the people pushed
in less to buy drugs than for consultations. So great was Homais'
reputation in the neighbouring villages. His (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) robust aplomb had
fascinated the rustics. They considered him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) a greater doctor than all
the doctors.

<p/>Emma was leaning out at the window; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was often there. The window in
the provinces replaces the theatre and the promenade, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was amusing
herself with watching the crowd of boors when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw a gentleman in
a green velvet coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had on yellow gloves, although he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wore heavy
gaiters; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was coming towards the doctor's house, followed by a peasant
walking with a bent head and quite a thoughtful air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I see the doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked Justin, who was talking on the
doorsteps with Felicite, and, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for a servant of the
house--<div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) that Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger of La Huchette is
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not from territorial vanity that the new arrival added <div class="bookquote">``of La
Huchette''  (<font color='red'><b>La Huchette</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name, but to make himself the better known.

<p/>La Huchette, in fact, was an estate near Yonville, where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had just
bought the chateau and two farms that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cultivated himself, without,
however, troubling very much about them. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lived as a bachelor, and was
supposed to have <div class="bookquote">``at least fifteen thousand francs a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a bachelor</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles came into the room. Monsieur Boulanger introduced his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) man, who
wanted to be bled because he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) felt <div class="bookquote">``a tingling all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll purge me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) urged as an objection to all reasoning.

<p/>So Bovary ordered a bandage and a basin, and asked Justin to hold it.
Then addressing the peasant, who was already pale--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid, my lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other; <div class="bookquote">``get on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with an air of bravado he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) great arm. At the prick of
the lancet the blood spurted out, splashing against the looking-glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold the basin nearer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lor!''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div>said the peasant, <div class="bookquote">``one would swear it was a little fountain
flowing. How red my blood is! That's a good sign, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>answered the doctor, <div class="bookquote">``one feels nothing at first, and then
syncope sets in, and more especially with people of strong constitution
like this man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words the rustic let go the lancet-case he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was twisting between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fingers. A shudder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shoulders made the chair-back creak. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
hat fell off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought as much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) finger on the vein.

<p/>The basin was beginning to tremble in Justin's hands; his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) knees shook,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) turned pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma! Emma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>called Charles.

<p/>With one bound she (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) came down the staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some vinegar,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``O dear! two at once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) emotion he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could hardly put on the compress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Boulanger quietly, taking Justin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>)
arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) seated him (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) on the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) back resting against the wall.

<p/>Madame Bovary began taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) cravat. The strings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) shirt had
got into a knot, and she (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was for some minutes moving her (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) light fingers
about the young fellow's neck. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) poured some vinegar on her (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>)
cambric handkerchief; she (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) moistened his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) temples with little dabs, and
then blew upon them softly. The ploughman revived, but Justin's syncope
still lasted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) eyeballs disappeared in the pale sclerotics like
blue flowers in milk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must hide this from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/>Madame Bovary took the basin to put it under the table. With the
movement she (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) made in bending down, her (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) dress -LRB-it was a summer dress with
four flounces, yellow, long in the waist and wide in the skirt-RRB- spread
out around her (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) on the flags of the room; and as Emma stooping, staggered
a little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms.

<p/>The stuff here and there gave with the inflections of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bust.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to fetch a bottle of water, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was melting some
pieces of sugar when the chemist arrived. The servant had been to
fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in the tumult. Seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) pupil's eyes staring he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) drew a long
breath; then going around him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) from head to foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``really a little fool! A fool in four letters! A
phlebotomy's a big affair, isn't it! And a fellow who isn't afraid of
anything; a kind of squirrel, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is who climbs to vertiginous
heights to shake down nuts. Oh, yes! you just talk to me, boast about
yourself! Here's a fine fitness for practising pharmacy later on; for
under serious circumstances you may be called before the tribunals in
order to enlighten the minds of the magistrates, and you would have to
keep your head then, to reason, show yourself a man, or else pass for an
imbecile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Justin did not answer. The chemist went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who asked you to come? You are always pestering the doctor and madame.
On Wednesday, moreover, your presence is indispensable to me. There are
now twenty people in the shop. I left everything because of the interest
I take in you. Come, get along! Sharp! Wait for me, and keep an eye on
the jars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>When Justin, who was rearranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) dress, had gone, they talked for a
little while about fainting-fits. Madame Bovary had never fainted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is extraordinary for a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Boulanger; <div class="bookquote">``but some
people are very susceptible. Thus in a duel, I have seen a second lose
consciousness at the mere sound of the loading of pistols.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist sight</b></font>)</div>said the chemist, <div class="bookquote">``the sight of other people's blood
doesn't affect me at all, but the mere thought of my own flowing would
make me faint if I reflected upon it too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist sight</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur Boulanger, however, dismissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) servant, advising him (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) to calm
himself, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) fancy was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It procured me the advantage of making your acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) added,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) looked at Emma as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) said this. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) put three francs on the
corner of the table, bowed negligently, and went out.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) was soon on the other side of the river -LRB-this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) way back to La
Huchette-RRB-, and Emma saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) in the meadow, walking under the poplars,
slackening his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) pace now and then as one who reflects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) said to himself; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very pretty, this
doctor's wife. Fine teeth, black eyes, a dainty foot, a figure like a
Parisienne's. Where the devil does she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) come from? Wherever did that fat
fellow pick her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger was thirty-four; he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) was of brutal
temperament and intelligent perspicacity, having, moreover, had much to
do with women, and knowing them well. This one had seemed pretty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>);
so he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) was thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is very stupid. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is tired of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), no doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has dirty
nails, and hasn't shaved for three days. While he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is trotting after his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
patients, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sits there botching socks. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gets bored! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would
like to live in town and dance polkas every evening. Poor little woman!
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is gaping after love like a carp after water on a kitchen-table.
With three words of gallantry she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d adore one, I'm sure of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d be
tender, charming. Yes; but how to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) afterwards?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the difficulties of love-making seen in the distance made him (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) by
contrast think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) mistress. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was an actress at Rouen, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>)
kept; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) had pondered over this image, with which, even in
remembrance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) was satiated--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Madame Bovary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``is much prettier, especially fresher.
Virginie is decidedly beginning to grow fat. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is so finiky about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
pleasures; and, besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a mania for prawns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The fields were empty, and around him (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) Rodolphe only heard the regular
beating of the grass striking against his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) boots, with a cry of the
grasshopper hidden at a distance among the oats. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) again saw Emma in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room, dressed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) undressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I will have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) cried, striking a blow with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) stick at a
clod in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) at once began to consider the political
part of the enterprise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) asked himself--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall we meet? By what means? We shall always be having the brat
on our hands, and the servant, the neighbours, and husband, all sorts of
worries. Pshaw! one would lose too much time over it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) resumed, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really has eyes that pierce one's heart like a
gimlet. And that pale complexion! I adore pale women!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) reached the top of the Arguiel hills he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) mind.
<div class="bookquote">``It's only finding the opportunities. Well, I will call in now and then.
I'll send them venison, poultry; I'll have myself bled, if need be. We
shall become friends; I'll invite them to my place. By Jove!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``there's the agricultural show coming on. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll be there. I shall see
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). We'll begin boldly, for that's the surest way.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter Eight

<p/>At last it came, the famous agricultural show. On the morning of the
solemnity all the inhabitants at their doors were chatting over the
preparations. The pediment of the town hall had been hung with garlands
of ivy; a tent had been erected in a meadow for the banquet; and in the
middle of the Place, in front of the church, a kind of bombarde was
to announce the arrival of the prefect and the names of the successful
farmers who had obtained prizes. The National Guard of Buchy -LRB-there was
none at Yonville-RRB- had come to join the corps of firemen, of whom Binet
was captain. On that day he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wore a collar even higher than usual; and,
tightly buttoned in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) tunic, his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) figure was so stiff and motionless
that the whole vital portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) person seemed to have descended into
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) legs, which rose in a cadence of set steps with a single movement.
As there was some rivalry between the tax-collector and the colonel,
both, to show off their talents, drilled their men separately. One
saw the red epaulettes and the black breastplates pass and re-pass
alternately; there was no end to it, and it constantly began again.
There had never been such a display of pomp. Several citizens had
scoured their houses the evening before; tri-coloured flags hung from
half-open windows; all the public-houses were full; and in the lovely
weather the starched caps, the golden crosses, and the coloured
neckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow, shone in the sun, and relieved
with the motley colours the sombre monotony of the frock-coats and blue
smocks. The neighbouring farmers' wives, when they got off their horses,
pulled out the long pins that fastened around them their dresses, turned
up for fear of mud; and the husbands, for their part, in order to save
their hats, kept their handkerchiefs around them, holding one corner
between their teeth.

<p/>The crowd came into the main street from both ends of the village.
People poured in from the lanes, the alleys, the houses; and from time
to time one heard knockers banging against doors closing behind women
with their gloves, who were going out to see the fete. What was most
admired were two long lamp-stands covered with lanterns, that flanked a
platform on which the authorities were to sit. Besides this there were
against the four columns of the town hall four kinds of poles,
each bearing a small standard of greenish cloth, embellished with
inscriptions in gold letters.

<p/>On one was written, <div class="bookquote">``To Commerce'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; on the other, <div class="bookquote">``To Agriculture'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; on
the third, <div class="bookquote">``To Industry'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; and on the fourth, <div class="bookquote">``To the Fine Arts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lefrancois/Lefrancois</b></font>)</div><p/>But the jubilation that brightened all faces seemed to darken that of
Madame Lefrancois, the innkeeper. Standing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) kitchen-steps she (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>)
muttered to herself, <div class="bookquote">``What rubbish! what rubbish! With their canvas
booth! Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under
a tent like a gipsy? They call all this fussing doing good to the place!
Then it wasn't worth while sending to Neufchatel for the keeper of a
cookshop! And for whom? For cowherds! tatterdemalions!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The druggist was passing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) had on a frock-coat, nankeen trousers,
beaver shoes, and, for a wonder, a hat with a low crown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant! Excuse me, I am in a hurry.''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>And as the fat widow asked
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) was going--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems odd to you, doesn't it, I who am always more cooped up in my
laboratory than the man's rat in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheese.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What cheese?''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>asked the landlady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing! nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>Homais continued. <div class="bookquote">``I merely wished to convey
to you, Madame Lefrancois, that I usually live at home like a recluse.
To-day, however, considering the circumstances, it is necessary--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're going down there!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said contemptuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am going,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>replied the druggist, astonished. <div class="bookquote">``Am I not a member
of the consulting commission?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lefrancois/Lefrancois</b></font>)</div><p/>Mere Lefrancois looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) for a few moments, and ended by saying
with a smile--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's another pair of shoes! But what does agriculture matter to you?
Do you understand anything about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I understand it, since I am a druggist--that is to say,
a chemist. And the object of chemistry, Madame Lefrancois, being the
knowledge of the reciprocal and molecular action of all natural bodies,
it follows that agriculture is comprised within its domain. And, in
fact, the composition of the manure, the fermentation of liquids, the
analyses of gases, and the influence of miasmata, what, I ask you, is
all this, if it isn't chemistry, pure and simple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The landlady</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlady did not answer. Homais went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think that to be an agriculturist it is necessary to have tilled
the earth or fattened fowls oneself? It is necessary rather to know the
composition of the substances in question--the geological strata, the
atmospheric actions, the quality of the soil, the minerals, the waters,
the density of the different bodies, their capillarity, and what not.
And one must be master of all the principles of hygiene in order to
direct, criticize the construction of buildings, the feeding of animals,
the diet of domestics. And, moreover, Madame Lefrancois, one must know
botany, be able to distinguish between plants, you understand, which are
the wholesome and those that are deleterious, which are unproductive
and which nutritive, if it is well to pull them up here and re-sow them
there, to propagate some, destroy others; in brief, one must keep pace
with science by means of pamphlets and public papers, be always on the
alert to find out improvements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlady never took her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) eyes off the <div class="bookquote">``Cafe Francois''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>and the chemist
went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would to God our agriculturists were chemists, or that at least they
would pay more attention to the counsels of science. Thus lately I
myself wrote a considerable tract, a memoir of over seventy-two pages,
entitled, `Cider, its Manufacture and its Effects, together with some
New Reflections on the Subject,' that I sent to the Agricultural Society
of Rouen, and which even procured me the honour of being received among
its members--Section, Agriculture; Class, Pomological. Well, if my
work had been given to the public--''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>But the druggist stopped, Madame
Lefrancois seemed so preoccupied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just look at them!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's past comprehension! Such a cookshop
as that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And with a shrug of the shoulders that stretched out over her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
breast the stitches of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) knitted bodice, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) pointed with both hands
at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) rival's inn, whence songs were heard issuing. <div class="bookquote">``Well, it won't
last long,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``It'll be over before a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Homais drew back with stupefaction. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) came down three steps and
whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) ear--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you didn't know it? There is to be an execution in next week.
It's Lheureux who is selling him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) out; he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) has killed him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) with bills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a terrible catastrophe!''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>cried the druggist, who always found
expressions in harmony with all imaginable circumstances.

<p/>Then the landlady began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) the story that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had heard from
Theodore, Monsieur Guillaumin's servant, and although she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) detested
Tellier, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) blamed Lheureux. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``a wheedler, a sneak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is in the market; he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is bowing to
Madame Bovary, who's got on a green bonnet. Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s taking Monsieur
Boulanger's arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Bovary!''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Homais. <div class="bookquote">``I must go at once and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) my
respects. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'ll be very glad to have a seat in the enclosure
under the peristyle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lefrancois/Lefrancois</b></font>)</div>And, without heeding Madame Lefrancois, who was
calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) back to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) more about it, the druggist walked off
rapidly with a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) lips, with straight knees, bowing copiously
to right and left, and taking up much room with the large tails of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>)
frock-coat that fluttered behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) in the wind.

<p/>Rodolphe, having caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) from afar, hurried on, but Madame
Bovary lost her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) breath; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) walked more slowly, and, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>),
said in a rough tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only to get away from that fat fellow, you know, the druggist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) elbow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the meaning of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) asked himself. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) out
of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) profile was so calm that one could guess nothing from it. It stood
out in the light from the oval of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) bonnet, with pale ribbons on it
like the leaves of weeds. Her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) eyes with their long curved lashes looked
straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), and though wide open, they seemed slightly puckered
by the cheek-bones, because of the blood pulsing gently under the
delicate skin. A pink line ran along the partition between her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) nostrils.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) head was bent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) shoulder, and the pearl tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) white
teeth were seen between her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) making fun of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>thought Rodolphe.

<p/>Emma's gesture, however, had only been meant for a warning; for Monsieur
Lheureux was accompanying them, and spoke now and again as if to enter
into the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a superb day! Everybody is out! The wind is east!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>And neither Madame Bovary nor Rodolphe answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), whilst at the
slightest movement made by them he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) drew near, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your
pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) hat.

<p/>When they reached the farrier's house, instead of following the road
up to the fence, Rodolphe suddenly turned down a path, drawing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
Madame Bovary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) called out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Monsieur Lheureux! See you again presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you got rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``allow oneself to be intruded upon by others? And as
to-day I have the happiness of being with you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma blushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) did not finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) sentence. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) talked of the fine
weather and of the pleasure of walking on the grass. A few daisies had
sprung up again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are some pretty Easter daisies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and enough of them to
furnish oracles to all the amorous maids in the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I pick some? What do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in love?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked, coughing a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm, h'm! who knows?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>answered Rodolphe.

<p/>The meadow began to fill, and the housewives hustled you with their
great umbrellas, their baskets, and their babies. One had often to get
out of the way of a long file of country folk, servant-maids with blue
stockings, flat shoes, silver rings, and who smelt of milk, when one
passed close to them. They walked along holding one another by the hand,
and thus they spread over the whole field from the row of open trees to
the banquet tent.

<p/>But this was the examination time, and the farmers one after the other
entered a kind of enclosure formed by a long cord supported on sticks.

<p/>The beasts were there, their noses towards the cord, and making a
confused line with their unequal rumps. Drowsy pigs were burrowing in
the earth with their snouts, calves were bleating, lambs baaing; the
cows, on knees folded in, were stretching their bellies on the grass,
slowly chewing the cud, and blinking their heavy eyelids at the gnats
that buzzed round them. Plough-men with bare arms were holding by the
halter prancing stallions that neighed with dilated nostrils looking
towards the mares. These stood quietly, stretching out their heads and
flowing manes, while their foals rested in their shadow, or now and then
came and sucked them. And above the long undulation of these crowded
animals one saw some white mane rising in the wind like a wave, or some
sharp horns sticking out, and the heads of men running about. Apart,
outside the enclosure, a hundred paces off, was a large black bull,
muzzled, with an iron ring in its nostrils, and who moved no more than
if he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) had been in bronze. A child in rags was holding him (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) by a rope.

<p/>Between the two lines the committee-men were walking with heavy steps,
examining each animal, then consulting one another in a low voice. One
who seemed of more importance now and then took notes in a book as he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>)
walked along. This was the president of the jury, Monsieur Derozerays de
la Panville. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) recognised Rodolphe he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) came forward quickly,
and smiling amiably, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Monsieur Boulanger, you are deserting us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rodolphe protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was just coming. But when the president had
disappeared--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ma foi!*''  (<font color='red'><b>the president</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall not go. Your company is better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>*Upon my word!

<p/>And while poking fun at the show, Rodolphe, to move about more easily,
showed the gendarme his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) blue card, and even stopped now and then in
front of some fine beast, which Madame Bovary did not at all admire.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) noticed this, and began jeering at the Yonville ladies and their
dresses; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) apologised for the negligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had that
incongruity of common and elegant in which the habitually vulgar think
they see the revelation of an eccentric existence, of the perturbations
of sentiment, the tyrannies of art, and always a certain contempt for
social conventions, that seduces or exasperates them. Thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) cambric
shirt with plaited cuffs was blown out by the wind in the opening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
waistcoat of grey ticking, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) broad-striped trousers disclosed at
the ankle nankeen boots with patent leather gaiters.

<p/>These were so polished that they reflected the grass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) trampled on
horses's dung with them, one hand in the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) jacket and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
straw hat on one side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when one lives in the country--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's waste of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>replied Rodolphe. <div class="bookquote">``To think that not one of these people
is capable of understanding even the cut of a coat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they talked about provincial mediocrity, of the lives it crushed,
the illusions lost there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe, <div class="bookquote">``am drifting into depression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said in astonishment; <div class="bookquote">``I thought you very light-hearted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! yes. I seem so, because in the midst of the world I know how to
wear the mask of a scoffer upon my face; and yet, how many a time at the
sight of a cemetery by moonlight have I not asked myself whether it were
not better to join those sleeping there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! and your friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You do not think of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends! What friends? Have I any? Who cares for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
accompanied the last words with a kind of whistling of the lips.

<p/>But they were obliged to separate from each other because of a great
pile of chairs that a man was carrying behind them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so overladen
with them that one could only see the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wooden shoes and the
ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two outstretched arms. It was Lestiboudois, the gravedigger,
who was carrying the church chairs about amongst the people. Alive to
all that concerned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interests, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hit upon this means of turning
the show to account; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) idea was succeeding, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no longer knew
which way to turn. In fact, the villagers, who were hot, quarreled for
these seats, whose straw smelt of incense, and they leant against the
thick backs, stained with the wax of candles, with a certain veneration.

<p/>Madame Bovary again took Rodolphe's arm; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) went on as if speaking to
himself--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have missed so many things. Always alone! Ah! if I had some aim
in life, if I had met some love, if I had found someone! Oh, how I would
have spent all the energy of which I am capable, surmounted everything,
overcome everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet it seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``that you are not to be pitied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``you are free--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hesitated, <div class="bookquote">``rich--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not mock me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) replied.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not mocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), when the report of a
cannon resounded. Immediately all began hustling one another pell-mell
towards the village.

<p/>It was a false alarm. The prefect seemed not to be coming, and the
members of the jury felt much embarrassed, not knowing if they ought to
begin the meeting or still wait.

<p/>At last at the end of the Place a large hired landau appeared, drawn by
two thin horses, which a coachman in a white hat was whipping lustily.
Binet had only just time to shout, <div class="bookquote">``Present arms!''  (<font color='red'><b>Binet/Monsieur Binet</b></font>)</div>and the colonel to
imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>). All ran towards the enclosure; everyone pushed forward. A
few even forgot their collars; but the equipage of the prefect seemed
to anticipate the crowd, and the two yoked jades, trapesing in their
harness, came up at a little trot in front of the peristyle of the town
hall at the very moment when the National Guard and firemen deployed,
beating drums and marking time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Present!''  (<font color='red'><b>Binet/Monsieur Binet</b></font>)</div>shouted Binet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halt!''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>shouted the colonel. <div class="bookquote">``Left about, march.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And after presenting arms, during which the clang of the band, letting
loose, rang out like a brass kettle rolling downstairs, all the guns
were lowered. Then was seen stepping down from the carriage a gentleman
in a short coat with silver braiding, with bald brow, and wearing a tuft
of hair at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, of a sallow complexion and the most
benign appearance. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes, very large and covered by heavy lids, were
half-closed to look at the crowd, while at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
sharp nose, and forced a smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sunken mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) recognised the
mayor by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) scarf, and explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that the prefect was not able
to come. He (<font color='blue'><b>prefect</b></font>) himself was a councillor at the prefecture; then he (<font color='blue'><b>prefect</b></font>) added
a few apologies. Monsieur Tuvache answered them with compliments; the
other confessed himself nervous; and they remained thus, face to face,
their foreheads almost touching, with the members of the jury all round,
the municipal council, the notable personages, the National Guard and
the crowd. The councillor pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) little cocked hat to his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>)
breast repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) bows, while Tuvache, bent like a bow, also smiled,
stammered, tried to say something, protested his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) devotion to the
monarchy and the honour that was being done to Yonville.

<p/>Hippolyte, the groom from the inn, took the head of the horses from the
coachman, and, limping along with his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) club-foot, led them to the door
of the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or'' (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>, where a number of peasants collected to look at the
carriage. The drum beat, the howitzer thundered, and the gentlemen one
by one mounted the platform, where they sat down in red utrecht velvet
arm-chairs that had been lent by Madame Tuvache.

<p/>All these people looked alike. Their fair flabby faces, somewhat tanned
by the sun, were the colour of sweet cider, and their puffy whiskers
emerged from stiff collars, kept up by white cravats with broad bows.
All the waist-coats were of velvet, double-breasted; all the watches
had, at the end of a long ribbon, an oval cornelian seal; everyone
rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) two hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) thighs, carefully stretching the stride of
their trousers, whose unsponged glossy cloth shone more brilliantly than
the leather of their heavy boots.

<p/>The ladies of the company stood at the back under the vestibule between
the pillars while the common herd was opposite, standing up or sitting
on chairs. As a matter of fact, Lestiboudois had brought thither all
those that he (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) had moved from the field, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) even kept running back
every minute to fetch others from the church. He (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) caused such confusion
with this piece of business that one had great difficulty in getting to
the small steps of the platform.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Lheureux to the chemist, who was passing to his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)
place, <div class="bookquote">``that they ought to have put up two Venetian masts with something
rather severe and rich for ornaments; it would have been a very pretty
effect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>replied Homais; <div class="bookquote">``but what can you expect? The mayor took
everything on his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) own shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) hasn't much taste. Poor Tuvache! and
he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) is even completely destitute of what is called the genius of art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Rodolphe, meanwhile, with Madame Bovary, had gone up to the first
floor of the town hall, to the <div class="bookquote">``council-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>and, as it was empty,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) declared that they could enjoy the sight there more comfortably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
fetched three stools from the round table under the bust of the monarch,
and having carried them to one of the windows, they sat down by each
other.

<p/>There was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much parleying.
At last the councillor got up. They knew now that his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) name was Lieuvain,
and in the crowd the name was passed from one to the other. After he (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) had
collated a few pages, and bent over them to see better, he (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) began--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen! May I be permitted first of all -LRB-before addressing you on
the object of our meeting to-day, and this sentiment will, I am sure, be
shared by you all-RRB-, may I be permitted, I say, to pay a tribute to the
higher administration, to the government to the monarch, gentle men, our
sovereign, to that beloved king, to whom no branch of public or private
prosperity is a matter of indifference, and who directs with a hand at
once so firm and wise the chariot of the state amid the incessant perils
of a stormy sea, knowing, moreover, how to make peace respected as well
as war, industry, commerce, agriculture, and the fine arts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe, <div class="bookquote">``to get back a little further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/>But at this moment the voice of the councillor rose to an extraordinary
pitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) declaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is no longer the time, gentlemen, when civil discord ensanguined
our public places, when the landlord, the business-man, the working-man
himself, falling asleep at night, lying down to peaceful sleep, trembled
lest he (<font color='blue'><b>working-man</b></font>) should be awakened suddenly by the noise of incendiary tocsins,
when the most subversive doctrines audaciously sapped foundations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, someone down there might see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>Rodolphe resumed, <div class="bookquote">``then
I should have to invent excuses for a fortnight; and with my bad
reputation--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are slandering yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! It is dreadful, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the councillor</b></font>)</div>continued the councillor, <div class="bookquote">``if, banishing from my
memory the remembrance of these sad pictures, I carry my eyes back
to the actual situation of our dear country, what do I see there?
Everywhere commerce and the arts are flourishing; everywhere new means
of communication, like so many new arteries in the body of the state,
establish within it new relations. Our great industrial centres have
recovered all their activity; religion, more consolidated, smiles in
all hearts; our ports are full, confidence is born again, and France
breathes once more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the councillor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>added Rodolphe, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps from the world's point of view they
are right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you not know that there are souls constantly
tormented? They need by turns to dream and to act, the purest passions
and the most turbulent joys, and thus they fling themselves into all
sorts of fantasies, of follies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) as one looks at a traveller who has voyaged over
strange lands, and went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not even this distraction, we poor women!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a traveller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sad distraction, for happiness isn't found in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is it ever found?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; one day it comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is what you have understood,''  (<font color='red'><b>the councillor</b></font>)</div>said the councillor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a work
that belongs wholly to civilization! you, men of progress and morality,
you have understood, I say, that political storms are even more
redoubtable than atmospheric disturbances!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes one day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>repeated Rodolphe, <div class="bookquote">``one day suddenly, and when
one is despairing of it. Then the horizon expands; it is as if a voice
cried, `It is here!' You feel the need of confiding the whole of your
life, of giving everything, sacrificing everything to this being. There
is no need for explanations; they understand one another. They have seen
each other in dreams!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``In fine, here it is, this treasure so sought
after, here before you. It glitters, it flashes; yet one still doubts,
one does not believe it; one remains dazzled, as if one went out from
darkness into light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) ended Rodolphe suited the action to the word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) face, like a man seized with giddiness. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) let it
fall on Emma's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took hers away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who would be surprised at it, gentlemen? He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) only who is so blind,
so plunged -LRB-I do not fear to say it-RRB-, so plunged in the prejudices
of another age as still to misunderstand the spirit of agricultural
populations. Where, indeed, is to be found more patriotism than in the
country, greater devotion to the public welfare, more intelligence, in a
word? And, gentlemen, I do not mean that superficial intelligence,
vain ornament of idle minds, but rather that profound and balanced
intelligence that applies itself above all else to useful objects, thus
contributing to the good of all, to the common amelioration and to
the support of the state, born of respect for law and the practice of
duty--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe. <div class="bookquote">``Always `duty.' I am sick of the word.
They are a lot of old blockheads in flannel vests and of old women with
foot-warmers and rosaries who constantly drone into our ears `Duty,
duty!' Ah! by Jove! one's duty is to feel what is great, cherish the
beautiful, and not accept all the conventions of society with the
ignominy that it imposes upon us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet--yet--''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>objected Madame Bovary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! Why cry out against the passions? Are they not the one
beautiful thing on the earth, the source of heroism, of enthusiasm, of
poetry, music, the arts, of everything, in a word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But one must,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``to some extent bow to the opinion of the
world and accept its moral code.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but there are two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``The small, the conventional, that
of men, that which constantly changes, that brays out so loudly, that
makes such a commotion here below, of the earth earthly, like the mass
of imbeciles you see down there. But the other, the eternal, that is
about us and above, like the landscape that surrounds us, and the blue
heavens that give us light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Lieuvain/Lieuvain</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur Lieuvain had just wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) mouth with a pocket-handkerchief.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what should I do here gentlemen, pointing out to you the uses
of agriculture? Who supplies our wants? Who provides our means of
subsistence? Is it not the agriculturist? The agriculturist, gentlemen,
who, sowing with laborious hand the fertile furrows of the country,
brings forth the corn, which, being ground, is made into a powder by
means of ingenious machinery, comes out thence under the name of flour,
and from there, transported to our cities, is soon delivered at the
baker's, who makes it into food for poor and rich alike. Again, is it
not the agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) abundant
flocks in the pastures? For how should we clothe ourselves, how nourish
ourselves, without the agriculturist? And, gentlemen, is it even
necessary to go so far for examples? Who has not frequently reflected
on all the momentous things that we get out of that modest animal, the
ornament of poultry-yards, that provides us at once with a soft pillow
for our bed, with succulent flesh for our tables, and eggs? But I should
never end if I were to enumerate one after the other all the different
products which the earth, well cultivated, like a generous mother,
lavishes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children. Here it is the vine, elsewhere the apple
tree for cider, there colza, farther on cheeses and flax. Gentlemen, let
us not forget flax, which has made such great strides of late years, and
to which I will more particularly call your attention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had no need to call it, for all the mouths of the multitude were wide
open, as if to drink in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) words. Tuvache by his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) side listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
with staring eyes. Monsieur Derozerays from time to time softly closed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) eyelids, and farther on the chemist, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) son Napoleon between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) knees, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) ear in order not to lose a syllable.
The chins of the other members of the jury went slowly up and down in
their waistcoats in sign of approval. The firemen at the foot of the
platform rested on their bayonets; and Binet, motionless, stood with
out-turned elbows, the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) sabre in the air. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) could
hear, but certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) could see nothing, because of the visor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
helmet, that fell down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) nose. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) lieutenant, the youngest son of
Monsieur Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was enormous, and shook on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) head, and from it an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) cotton scarf peeped out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) smiled
beneath it with a perfectly infantine sweetness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) pale little
face, whence drops were running, wore an expression of enjoyment and
sleepiness.

<p/>The square as far as the houses was crowded with people. One saw folk
leaning on their elbows at all the windows, others standing at doors,
and Justin, in front of the chemist's shop, seemed quite transfixed by
the sight of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) was looking at. In spite of the silence Monsieur
Lieuvain's voice was lost in the air. It reached you in fragments of
phrases, and interrupted here and there by the creaking of chairs in the
crowd; then you suddenly heard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the
bleating of the lambs, who answered one another at street corners. In
fact, the cowherds and shepherds had driven their beasts thus far, and
these lowed from time to time, while with their tongues they tore down
some scrap of foliage that hung above their mouths.

<p/>Rodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in a low voice,
speaking rapidly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does not this conspiracy of the world revolt you? Is there a single
sentiment it does not condemn? The noblest instincts, the purest
sympathies are persecuted, slandered; and if at length two poor souls do
meet, all is so organised that they cannot blend together. Yet they will
make the attempt; they will flutter their wings; they will call upon
each other. Oh! no matter. Sooner or later, in six months, ten years,
they will come together, will love; for fate has decreed it, and they
are born one for the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) arms were folded across his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) knees, and thus lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) face towards
Emma, close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) looked fixedly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) noticed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) eyes
small golden lines radiating from black pupils; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even smelt the
perfume of the pomade that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) hair glossy.

<p/>Then a faintness came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recalled the Viscount who had
waltzed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at Vaubyessard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) beard exhaled like this air an
odour of vanilla and citron, and mechanically she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) half-closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes
the better to breathe it in. But in making this movement, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leant
back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw in the distance, right on the line of the
horizon, the old diligence, the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that was slowly descending
the hill of Leux, dragging after it a long trail of dust. It was in this
yellow carriage that Leon had so often come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and by this
route down there that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had gone for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
opposite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) windows; then all grew confused; clouds gathered; it
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was again turning in the waltz under the light of
the lustres on the arm of the Viscount, and that Leon was not far away,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was coming; and yet all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was conscious of the scent
of Rodolphe's head by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side. This sweetness of sensation pierced
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) old desires, and these, like grains of sand under a gust
of wind, eddied to and fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which
suffused her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opened wide her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nostrils several times to drink
in the freshness of the ivy round the capitals. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gloves,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands, then fanned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) handkerchief, while
athwart the throbbing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) temples she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard the murmur of the
crowd and the voice of the councillor intoning his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) phrases. He (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>)
said--``Continue, persevere; listen neither to the suggestions of
routine, nor to the over-hasty councils of a rash empiricism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apply yourselves, above all, to the amelioration of the soil, to good
manures, to the development of the equine, bovine, ovine, and porcine
races. Let these shows be to you pacific arenas, where the victor in
leaving it will hold forth a hand to the vanquished, and will fraternise
with him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) in the hope of better success. And you, aged servants, humble
domestics, whose hard labour no Government up to this day has taken into
consideration, come hither to receive the reward of your silent virtues,
and be assured that the state henceforward has its eye upon you; that it
encourages you, protects you; that it will accede to your just
demands, and alleviate as much as in it lies the burden of your painful
sacrifices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Lieuvain/Lieuvain</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur Lieuvain then sat down; Monsieur Derozerays got up, beginning
another speech. His (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) was not perhaps so florid as that of the councillor,
but it recommended itself by a more direct style, that is to say, by
more special knowledge and more elevated considerations. Thus the praise
of the Government took up less space in it; religion and agriculture
more. He (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) showed in it the relations of these two, and how they had
always contributed to civilisation. Rodolphe with Madame Bovary was
talking dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the cradle of
society, the orator painted those fierce times when men lived on acorns
in the heart of woods. Then they had left off the skins of beasts, had
put on cloth, tilled the soil, planted the vine. Was this a good, and
in this discovery was there not more of injury than of gain? Monsieur
Derozerays set himself this problem. From magnetism little by little
Rodolphe had come to affinities, and while the president was citing
Cincinnatus and his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) plough, Diocletian, planting his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) cabbages, and the
Emperors of China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed, the
young man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible
attractions find their cause in some previous state of existence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thus we,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why did we come to know one another? What chance
willed it? It was because across the infinite, like two streams that
flow but to unite; our special bents of mind had driven us towards each
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not withdraw it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For good farming generally!''  (<font color='red'><b>the president</b></font>)</div>cried the president.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now, for example, when I went to your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Monsieur Bizat of Quincampoix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I know I should accompany you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventy francs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred times I wished to go; and I followed you--I remained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Manures!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall remain to-night, to-morrow, all other days, all my life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Monsieur Caron of Argueil, a gold medal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For I have never in the society of any other person found so complete a
charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Monsieur Bain of Givry-Saint-Martin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall carry away with me the remembrance of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a merino ram!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will forget me; I shall pass away like a shadow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Monsieur Belot of Notre-Dame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! I shall be something in your thought, in your life, shall I
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Porcine race; prizes--equal, to Messrs. Leherisse and Cullembourg,
sixty francs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/>Rodolphe was pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) felt it all warm and quivering
like a captive dove that wants to fly away; but, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was trying
to take it away or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) pressure; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made a
movement with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I thank you! You do not repulse me! You are good! You understand
that I am yours! Let me look at you; let me contemplate you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>A gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on the
table, and in the square below all the great caps of the peasant women
were uplifted by it like the wings of white butterflies fluttering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Use of oil-cakes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the president</b></font>)</div>continued the president. He (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) was hurrying on:
<div class="bookquote">``Flemish manure-flax-growing-drainage-long leases-domestic service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Rodolphe was no longer speaking. They looked at one another. A supreme
desire made their dry lips tremble, and wearily, without an effort,
their fingers intertwined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux, of Sassetot-la-Guerriere, for
fifty-four years of service at the same farm, a silver medal--value,
twenty-five francs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Catherine Leroux?''  (<font color='red'><b>the councillor</b></font>)</div>repeated the councillor.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not present herself, and one could hear voices whispering--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how stupid she (<font color='blue'><b>Leroux</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Leroux</b></font>) there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Tuvache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; here she (<font color='blue'><b>Leroux</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let her (<font color='blue'><b>Leroux</b></font>) come up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there came forward on the platform a little old woman with timid
bearing, who seemed to shrink within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor clothes. On her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
wore heavy wooden clogs, and from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hips hung a large blue apron. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
pale face framed in a borderless cap was more wrinkled than a withered
russet apple. And from the sleeves of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) red jacket looked out two
large hands with knotty joints, the dust of barns, the potash of washing
the grease of wools had so encrusted, roughened, hardened these that
they seemed dirty, although they had been rinsed in clear water; and
by dint of long service they remained half open, as if to bear humble
witness for themselves of so much suffering endured. Something of
monastic rigidity dignified her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. Nothing of sadness or of emotion
weakened that pale look. In her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) constant living with animals she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
caught their dumbness and their calm. It was the first time that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
found herself in the midst of so large a company, and inwardly scared by
the flags, the drums, the gentlemen in frock-coats, and the order of the
councillor, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood motionless, not knowing whether to advance or run
away, nor why the crowd was pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and the jury were smiling at
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>Thus stood before these radiant bourgeois this half-century of
servitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Approach, venerable Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux!''  (<font color='red'><b>the councillor Approach</b></font>)</div>said the
councillor, who had taken the list of prize-winners from the president;
and, looking at the piece of paper and the old woman by turns, he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>)
repeated in a fatherly tone--<div class="bookquote">``Approach! approach!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you deaf?''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Tuvache/Tuvache</b></font>)</div>said Tuvache, fidgeting in his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) armchair; and he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) began
shouting in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ear, <div class="bookquote">``Fifty-four years of service. A silver medal!
Twenty-five francs! For you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) medal, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at it, and a smile of beatitude
spread over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked away they could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
muttering <div class="bookquote">``I'll give it to our cure up home, to say some masses for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What fanaticism!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the chemist, leaning across to the notary.

<p/>The meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the speeches had
been read, each one fell back into his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) place again, and everything into
the old grooves; the masters bullied the servants, and these struck the
animals, indolent victors, going back to the stalls, a green-crown on
their horns.

<p/>The National Guards, however, had gone up to the first floor of the
town hall with buns spitted on their bayonets, and the drummer of the
battalion carried a basket with bottles. Madame Bovary took Rodolphe's
arm; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Guards</b></font>) home; they separated at her (<font color='blue'><b>Guards</b></font>) door; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) walked about
alone in the meadow while he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) waited for the time of the banquet.

<p/>The feast was long, noisy, ill served; the guests were so crowded that
they could hardly move their elbows; and the narrow planks used for
forms almost broke down under their weight. They ate hugely. Each one
stuffed himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) own account. Sweat stood on every brow, and a
whitish steam, like the vapour of a stream on an autumn morning, floated
above the table between the hanging lamps. Rodolphe, leaning against
the calico of the tent was thinking so earnestly of Emma that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) heard
nothing. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) on the grass the servants were piling up the dirty
plates, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) neighbours were talking; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) did not answer them; they filled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) glass, and there was silence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) thoughts in spite of the growing
noise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was dreaming of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had said, of the line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face, as in a magic mirror, shone on the plates of the shakos, the
folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gown fell along the walls, and days of love unrolled to all
infinity before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) in the vistas of the future.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) again in the evening during the fireworks, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband, Madame Homais, and the druggist, who was worrying about the
danger of stray rockets, and every moment he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) left the company to go and
give some advice to Binet.

<p/>The pyrotechnic pieces sent to Monsieur Tuvache had, through an excess
of caution, been shut up in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cellar, and so the damp powder would
not light, and the principal set piece, that was to represent a dragon
biting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tail, failed completely. Now and then a meagre Roman-candle
went off; then the gaping crowd sent up a shout that mingled with the
cry of the women, whose waists were being squeezed in the darkness. Emma
silently nestled against Charles's shoulder; then, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
watched the luminous rays of the rockets against the dark sky. Rodolphe
gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the light of the burning lanterns.

<p/>They went out one by one. The stars shone out. A few crops of rain began
to fall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knotted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fichu round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bare head.

<p/>At this moment the councillor's carriage came out from the inn.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) coachman, who was drunk, suddenly dozed off, and one could see from
the distance, above the hood, between the two lanterns, the mass of his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>)
body, that swayed from right to left with the giving of the traces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>said the druggist, <div class="bookquote">``one ought to proceed most rigorously
against drunkenness! I should like to see written up weekly at the door
of the town hall on a board ad hoc* the names of all those who during
the week got intoxicated on alcohol. Besides, with regard to statistics,
one would thus have, as it were, public records that one could refer to
in case of need. But excuse me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>*Specifically for that.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) once more ran off to the captain. The latter was going back to
see his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) lathe again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you would not do ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>Homais said to him (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to send one of your
men, or to go yourself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>answered the tax-collector. <div class="bookquote">``It's all right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be uneasy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>said the druggist, when he (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) friends.
<div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Binet has assured me that all precautions have been taken. No
sparks have fallen; the pumps are full. Let us go to rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ma foi! I want it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div>said Madame Homais, yawning at large. <div class="bookquote">``But never
mind; we've had a beautiful day for our fete.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/>Rodolphe repeated in a low voice, and with a tender look, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! very
beautiful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/>And having bowed to one another, they separated.

<p/>Two days later, in the <div class="bookquote">``Final de Rouen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>there was a long article on the
show. Homais had composed it with verve the very next morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why these festoons, these flowers, these garlands? Whither hurries this
crowd like the waves of a furious sea under the torrents of a tropical
sun pouring its heat upon our heads?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) spoke of the condition of the peasants. Certainly the Government
was doing much, but not enough. <div class="bookquote">``Courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) cried to it; <div class="bookquote">``a thousand
reforms are indispensable; let us accomplish them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then touching on
the entry of the councillor, he (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) did not forget <div class="bookquote">``the martial air of our
militia;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>nor <div class="bookquote">``our most merry village maidens;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>nor the <div class="bookquote">``bald-headed old
men like patriarchs who were there, and of whom some, the remnants of
our phalanxes, still felt their hearts beat at the manly sound of the
drums.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) cited himself among the first of the members of the jury,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) even called attention in a note to the fact that Monsieur Homais,
chemist, had sent a memoir on cider to the agricultural society.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) came to the distribution of the prizes, he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) painted the joy of
the prize-winners in dithyrambic strophes. ``The father embraced the son,
the brother the brother, the husband his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) consort. More than one showed
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) humble medal with pride; and no doubt when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) got home to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) good
housewife, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hung it up weeping on the modest walls of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About six o’clock a banquet prepared in the meadow of Monsieur Leigeard
brought together the principal personages of the fete. The greatest
cordiality reigned here. Divers toasts were proposed: Monsieur
Lieuvain, the King; Monsieur Tuvache, the Prefect; Monsieur Derozerays,
Agriculture; Monsieur Homais, Industry and the Fine Arts, those twin
sisters; Monsieur Leplichey, Progress. In the evening some brilliant
fireworks on a sudden illumined the air. One would have called it a
veritable kaleidoscope, a real operatic scene; and for a moment our
little locality might have thought itself transported into the midst of
a dream of the `Thousand and One Nights.' Let us state that no untoward
event disturbed this family meeting.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) added <div class="bookquote">``Only the absence
of the clergy was remarked. No doubt the priests understand progress in
another fashion. Just as you please, messieurs the followers of Loyola!''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter Nine

<p/>Six weeks passed. Rodolphe did not come again. At last one evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
appeared.

<p/>The day after the show he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had said to himself--<div class="bookquote">``We mustn't go back too
soon; that would be a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And at the end of a week he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had gone off hunting. After the hunting he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
had thought it was too late, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) reasoned thus--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If from the first day she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) loved me, she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) must from impatience to see me
again love me more. Let's go on with it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) calculation had been right when, on entering the
room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) saw Emma turn pale.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was alone. The day was drawing in. The small muslin curtain along
the windows deepened the twilight, and the gilding of the barometer, on
which the rays of the sun fell, shone in the looking-glass between the
meshes of the coral.

<p/>Rodolphe remained standing, and Emma hardly answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) first
conventional phrases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``have been busy. I have been ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seriously?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe, sitting down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side on a footstool, <div class="bookquote">``no; it
was because I did not want to come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you not guess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) again, but so hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, blushing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, drawing back a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) in a melancholy voice, <div class="bookquote">``that I was right not
to come back; for this name, this name that fills my whole soul, and
that escaped me, you forbid me to use! Madame Bovary! why all the
world calls you thus! Besides, it is not your name; it is the name of
another!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``of another!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think of you constantly. The memory of you drives me to despair.
Ah! forgive me! I will leave you! Farewell! I will go far away, so far
that you will never hear of me again; and yet--to-day--I know not what
force impelled me towards you. For one does not struggle against Heaven;
one cannot resist the smile of angels; one is carried away by that which
is beautiful, charming, adorable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the first time that Emma had heard such words spoken to herself,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pride, like one who reposes bathed in warmth, expanded softly
and fully at this glowing language.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I did not come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``if I could not see you, at least
I have gazed long on all that surrounds you. At night-every night-I
arose; I came hither; I watched your house, its glimmering in the moon,
the trees in the garden swaying before your window, and the little lamp,
a gleam shining through the window-panes in the darkness. Ah! you never
knew that there, so near you, so far from you, was a poor wretch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) with a sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are good!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I love you, that is all! You do not doubt that! Tell me--one
word--only one word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/>And Rodolphe imperceptibly glided from the footstool to the ground; but
a sound of wooden shoes was heard in the kitchen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) noticed the
door of the room was not closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind it would be of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) went on, rising, <div class="bookquote">``if you would humour
a whim of mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was to go over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) wanted to know it; and
Madame Bovary seeing no objection to this, they both rose, when Charles
came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>Rodolphe said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>).

<p/>The doctor, flattered at this unexpected title, launched out into
obsequious phrases. Of this the other took advantage to pull himself
together a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame was speaking to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) then said, <div class="bookquote">``about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had indeed a thousand anxieties; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife's
palpitations of the heart were beginning again. Then Rodolphe asked if
riding would not be good.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly! excellent! just the thing! There's an idea! You ought to
follow it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) objected that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had no horse, Monsieur Rodolphe offered
one. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) offer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) did not insist. Then to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) visit
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) ploughman, the man of the blood-letting, still suffered
from giddiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll call around,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! I'll send him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to you; we'll come; that will be more convenient
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! very good! I thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And as soon as they were alone, <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you accept Monsieur
Boulanger's kind offer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) assumed a sulky air, invented a thousand excuses, and finally
declared that perhaps it would look odd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what the deuce do I care for that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles, making a
pirouette. <div class="bookquote">``Health before everything! You are wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you think I can ride when I haven't got a habit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must order one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) answered.

<p/>The riding-habit decided her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>When the habit was ready, Charles wrote to Monsieur Boulanger that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wife was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) command, and that they counted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) good-nature.

<p/>The next day at noon Rodolphe appeared at Charles's door with two
saddle-horses. One had pink rosettes at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ears and a deerskin
side-saddle.

<p/>Rodolphe had put on high soft boots, saying to himself that no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had never seen anything like them. In fact, Emma was charmed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
appearance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) stood on the landing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) great velvet coat and white
corduroy breeches. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was ready; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>).

<p/>Justin escaped from the chemist's to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) start, and the chemist also
came out. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) was giving Monsieur Boulanger a little good advice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An accident happens so easily. Be careful! Your horses perhaps are
mettlesome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard a noise above her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); it was Felicite drumming on the windowpanes
to amuse little Berthe. The child blew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a kiss; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother answered
with a wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pleasant ride!''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>cried Monsieur Homais. <div class="bookquote">``Prudence! above all,
prudence!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) flourished his (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) newspaper as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) saw them disappear.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boulanger</b></font>) felt the ground, Emma's horse set off at a gallop.

<p/>Rodolphe galloped by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side. Now and then they exchanged a word. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
figure slightly bent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand well up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) right arm stretched out,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave herself up to the cadence of the movement that rocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saddle. At the bottom of the hill Rodolphe gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) horse its head;
they started together at a bound, then at the top suddenly the horses
stopped, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) large blue veil fell about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>It was early in October. There was fog over the land. Hazy clouds
hovered on the horizon between the outlines of the hills; others, rent
asunder, floated up and disappeared. Sometimes through a rift in the
clouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar the roots of
Yonville, with the gardens at the water's edge, the yards, the walls and
the church steeple. Emma half closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes to pick out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) house, and
never had this poor village where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lived appeared so small. From the
height on which they were the whole valley seemed an immense pale lake
sending off its vapour into the air. Clumps of trees here and there
stood out like black rocks, and the tall lines of the poplars that rose
above the mist were like a beach stirred by the wind.

<p/>By the side, on the turf between the pines, a brown light shimmered
in the warm atmosphere. The earth, ruddy like the powder of tobacco,
deadened the noise of their steps, and with the edge of their shoes the
horses as they walked kicked the fallen fir cones in front of them.

<p/>Rodolphe and Emma thus went along the skirt of the wood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned
away from time to time to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) look, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw only the pine
trunks in lines, whose monotonous succession made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a little giddy.
The horses were panting; the leather of the saddles creaked.

<p/>Just as they were entering the forest the sun shone out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God protects us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forward! forward!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) continued.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``tchk'd''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) tongue. The two beasts set off at a trot.

<p/>Long ferns by the roadside caught in Emma's stirrup.

<p/>Rodolphe leant forward and removed them as they rode along. At other
times, to turn aside the branches, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) passed close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and Emma felt
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) knee brushing against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leg. The sky was now blue, the leaves no
longer stirred. There were spaces full of heather in flower, and plots
of violets alternated with the confused patches of the trees that were
grey, fawn, or golden coloured, according to the nature of their leaves.
Often in the thicket was heard the fluttering of wings, or else the
hoarse, soft cry of the ravens flying off amidst the oaks.

<p/>They dismounted. Rodolphe fastened up the horses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked on in
front on the moss between the paths. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) long habit got in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way,
although she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) held it up by the skirt; and Rodolphe, walking behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
saw between the black cloth and the black shoe the fineness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) white
stocking, that seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) as if it were a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nakedness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped. <div class="bookquote">``I am tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, try again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``Courage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then some hundred paces farther on she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) again stopped, and through her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
veil, that fell sideways from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) man's hat over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hips, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face
appeared in a bluish transparency as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) were floating under azure
waves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where are we going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was breathing irregularly. Rodolphe looked round
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) moustache. They came to a larger space where the coppice
had been cut. They sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, and Rodolphe
began speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) did not begin by frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
with compliments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was calm, serious, melancholy.

<p/>Emma listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) with bowed head, and stirred the bits of wood on
the ground with the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) foot. But at the words, <div class="bookquote">``Are not our
destinies now one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``You know that well. It is impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rose
to go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) by the wrist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped. Then, having gazed
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) for a few moments with an amorous and humid look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said
hurriedly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! do not speak of it again! Where are the horses? Let us go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) made a gesture of anger and annoyance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) repeated:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the horses? Where are the horses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Then smiling a strange smile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) pupil fixed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) teeth set, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
advanced with outstretched arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recoiled trembling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stammered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you frighten me! You hurt me! Let me go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it must be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) went on, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) face changing; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) again became
respectful, caressing, timid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm. They went back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was the matter with you? Why? I do not understand. You were
mistaken, no doubt. In my soul you are as a Madonna on a pedestal, in
a place lofty, secure, immaculate. But I need you to live! I must have
your eyes, your voice, your thought! Be my friend, my sister, my angel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feebly tried to disengage
herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thus as they walked along.

<p/>But they heard the two horses browsing on the leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! one moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe. <div class="bookquote">``Do not let us go! Stay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) farther on to a small pool where duckweeds made a greenness
on the water. Faded water lilies lay motionless between the reeds.
At the noise of their steps in the grass, frogs jumped away to hide
themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am wrong! I am wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am mad to listen to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Emma! Emma!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Rodolphe!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman slowly, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>The cloth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) habit caught against the velvet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) coat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw
back her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) white neck, swelling with a sigh, and faltering, in tears, with
a long shudder and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave herself up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)--

<p/>The shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun passing between the
branches dazzled the eyes. Here and there around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), in the leaves
or on the ground, trembled luminous patches, as it hummingbirds flying
about had scattered their feathers. Silence was everywhere; something
sweet seemed to come forth from the trees; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, whose
beating had begun again, and the blood coursing through her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) flesh like a
stream of milk. Then far away, beyond the wood, on the other hills, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
heard a vague prolonged cry, a voice which lingered, and in silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
heard it mingling like music with the last pulsations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) throbbing
nerves. Rodolphe, a cigar between his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) lips, was mending with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
penknife one of the two broken bridles.

<p/>They returned to Yonville by the same road. On the mud they saw again
the traces of their horses side by side, the same thickets, the same
stones to the grass; nothing around them seemed changed; and yet for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
something had happened more stupendous than if the mountains had moved
in their places. Rodolphe now and again bent forward and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand
to kiss it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was charming on horseback--upright, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) slender waist, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knee
bent on the mane of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) horse, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face somewhat flushed by the fresh
air in the red of the evening.

<p/>On entering Yonville she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) horse prance in the road. People
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the windows.

<p/>At dinner her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked well, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pretended not to
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) inquired about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ride, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) remained sitting there
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) elbow at the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plate between the two lighted candles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I spent the afternoon at Monsieur Alexandre's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandre</b></font>) has an old cob,
still very fine, only a little broken-kneed, and that could be bought; I
am sure, for a hundred crowns.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``And thinking it might please
you, I have bespoken it--bought it. Have I done right? Do tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head in assent; then a quarter of an hour later--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going out to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing, nothing, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had got rid of Charles she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went and shut herself up
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room.

<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt stunned; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the trees, the paths, the ditches,
Rodolphe, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) again felt the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) arm, while the leaves
rustled and the reeds whistled.

<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw herself in the glass she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face. Never
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes been so large, so black, of so profound a depth. Something
subtle about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being transfigured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I have a lover!
a lover!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>delighting at the idea as if a second puberty had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
So at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to know those joys of love, that fever of happiness
of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had despaired! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was entering upon marvels where all
would be passion, ecstasy, delirium. An azure infinity encompassed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), the heights of sentiment sparkled under her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, and ordinary
existence appeared only afar off, down below in the shade, through the
interspaces of these heights.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recalled the heroines of the books that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had read, and the
lyric legion of these adulterous women began to sing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) memory with
the voice of sisters that charmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) became herself, as it were,
an actual part of these imaginings, and realised the love-dream of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
youth as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw herself in this type of amorous women whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
so envied. Besides, Emma felt a satisfaction of revenge. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not
suffered enough? But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) triumphed, and the love so long pent up
burst forth in full joyous bubblings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tasted it without remorse,
without anxiety, without trouble.

<p/>The day following passed with a new sweetness. They made vows to one
another She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sorrows. Rodolphe interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with
kisses; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) through half-closed eyes, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) to
call her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) again by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) name--to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) They were in the
forest, as yesterday, in the shed of some woodenshoe maker. The walls
were of straw, and the roof so low they had to stoop. They were seated
side by side on a bed of dry leaves.

<p/>From that day forth they wrote to one another regularly every evening.
Emma placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) letter at the end of the garden, by the river, in a
fissure of the wall. Rodolphe came to fetch it, and put another there,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) always found fault with as too short.

<p/>One morning, when Charles had gone out before day break, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was seized
with the fancy to see Rodolphe at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would go quickly to La
Huchette, stay there an hour, and be back again at Yonville while
everyone was still asleep. This idea made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pant with desire, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
soon found herself in the middle of the field, walking with rapid steps,
without looking behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>Day was just breaking. Emma from afar recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lover's house. Its
two dove-tailed weathercocks stood out black against the pale dawn.

<p/>Beyond the farmyard there was a detached building that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought must
be the chateau She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) entered--it was if the doors at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) approach had
opened wide of their own accord. A large straight staircase led up to
the corridor. Emma raised the latch of a door, and suddenly at the end
of the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw a man sleeping. It was Rodolphe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) uttered a cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You here? You here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``How did you manage to come? Ah! your
dress is damp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) neck.

<p/>This first piece of daring successful, now every time Charles went out
early Emma dressed quickly and slipped on tiptoe down the steps that led
to the waterside.

<p/>But when the plank for the cows was taken up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to go by the walls
alongside of the river; the bank was slippery; in order not to fall
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caught hold of the tufts of faded wallflowers. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went across
ploughed fields, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sank, stumbling; and clogging her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thin
shoes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) scarf, knotted round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, fluttered to the wind in the
meadows. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was afraid of the oxen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to run; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arrived out
of breath, with rosy cheeks, and breathing out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whole person a
fresh perfume of sap, of verdure, of the open air. At this hour Rodolphe
still slept. It was like a spring morning coming into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) room.

<p/>The yellow curtains along the windows let a heavy, whitish light enter
softly. Emma felt about, opening and closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, while the drops
of dew hanging from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair formed, as it were, a topaz aureole around
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face. Rodolphe, laughing, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
breast.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the tables,
combed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) comb, and looked at herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
shaving-glass. Often she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even put between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) teeth the big pipe that
lay on the table by the bed, amongst lemons and pieces of sugar near a
bottle of water.

<p/>It took them a good quarter of an hour to say goodbye. Then Emma cried.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have wished never to leave Rodolphe. Something stronger than
herself forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>); so much so, that one day, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) come
unexpectedly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) frowned as one put out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Are you ill? Tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) declared with a serious air that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visits were becoming
imprudent--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was compromising herself.



<p/>Chapter Ten

<p/>Gradually Rodolphe's fears took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). At first, love had
intoxicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had thought of nothing beyond. But now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
was indispensable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feared to lose anything of this, or
even that it should be disturbed. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) came back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) house she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
looked all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), anxiously watching every form that passed in the
horizon, and every village window from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could be seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
listened for steps, cries, the noise of the ploughs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped
short, white, and trembling more than the aspen leaves swaying overhead.

<p/>One morning as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was thus returning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suddenly thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the
long barrel of a carbine that seemed to be aimed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It stuck out
sideways from the end of a small tub half-buried in the grass on the
edge of a ditch. Emma, half-fainting with terror, nevertheless walked
on, and a man stepped out of the tub like a Jack-in-the-box. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
gaiters buckled up to the knees, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap pulled down over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes,
trembling lips, and a red nose. It was Captain Binet lying in ambush for
wild ducks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have called out long ago!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) exclaimed; <div class="bookquote">``When one sees a
gun, one should always give warning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The tax-collector was thus trying to hide the fright he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had had, for
a prefectorial order having prohibited duckhunting except in boats,
Monsieur Binet, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) respect for the laws, was infringing them,
and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) every moment expected to see the rural guard turn up. But
this anxiety whetted his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) pleasure, and, all alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) tub, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
congratulated himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) luck and on his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) cuteness. At sight of
Emma he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) seemed relieved from a great weight, and at once entered upon a
conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't warm; it's nipping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma answered nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you're out so early?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said stammering; <div class="bookquote">``I am just coming from the nurse where my
child is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! very good! very good! For myself, I am here, just as you see me,
since break of day; but the weather is so muggy, that unless one had the
bird at the mouth of the gun--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Monsieur Binet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), turning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
heel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) replied drily; and he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) went back into his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) tub.

<p/>Emma regretted having left the tax-collector so abruptly. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
would form unfavourable conjectures. The story about the nurse was the
worst possible excuse, everyone at Yonville knowing that the little
Bovary had been at home with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) parents for a year. Besides, no one
was living in this direction; this path led only to La Huchette. Binet,
then, would guess whence she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) would not keep silence; he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
would talk, that was certain. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) remained until evening racking her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
brain with every conceivable lying project, and had constantly before
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) eyes that imbecile with the game-bag.

<p/>Charles after dinner, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) gloomy, proposed, by way of
distraction, to take her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) to the chemist's, and the first person she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
caught sight of in the shop was the taxcollector again. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) was standing
in front of the counter, lit up by the gleams of the red bottle, and was
saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please give me half an ounce of vitriol.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Justin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>cried the druggist, <div class="bookquote">``bring us the sulphuric acid.''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>Then to
Emma, who was going up to Madame Homais' room, <div class="bookquote">``No, stay here; it isn't
worth while going up; she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is just coming down. Warm yourself at the
stove in the meantime. Excuse me. Good-day, doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for the chemist
much enjoyed pronouncing the word <div class="bookquote">``doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>as if addressing another by
it reflected on himself some of the grandeur that he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) found in it-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Now,
take care not to upset the mortars! You'd better fetch some chairs from
the little room; you know very well that the arm-chairs are not to be
taken out of the drawing-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And to put his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) arm-chair back in its place he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) was darting away from the
counter, when Binet asked him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) for half an ounce of sugar acid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sugar acid!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist contemptuously, <div class="bookquote">``don't know it; I'm
ignorant of it! But perhaps you want oxalic acid. It is oxalic acid,
isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>Binet explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) wanted a corrosive to make himself some
copperwater with which to remove rust from his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) hunting things.

<p/>Emma shuddered. The chemist began saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed the weather is not propitious on account of the damp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tax-collector</b></font>)</div>replied the tax-collector, with a sly look, <div class="bookquote">``there are
people who like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the tax-collector</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was stifling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And give me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Sugar</b></font>) never go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half an ounce of resin and turpentine, four ounces of yellow wax,
and three half ounces of animal charcoal, if you please, to clean the
varnished leather of my togs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>The druggist was beginning to cut the wax when Madame Homais appeared,
Irma in her (<font color='blue'><b>Irma</b></font>) arms, Napoleon by her (<font color='blue'><b>Irma</b></font>) side, and Athalie following. She (<font color='blue'><b>Irma</b></font>) sat
down on the velvet seat by the window, and the lad squatted down on a
footstool, while his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) eldest sister hovered round the jujube box near
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) papa. The latter was filling funnels and corking phials, sticking on
labels, making up parcels. Around him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) all were silent; only from time
to time, were heard the weights jingling in the balance, and a few low
words from the chemist giving directions to his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) pupil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how's the little woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div>suddenly asked Madame Homais.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>exclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband, who was writing down some figures in
his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) waste-book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went on in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma, pointing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) finger to the druggist.

<p/>But Binet, quite absorbed in looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) bill, had probably heard
nothing. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) went out. Then Emma, relieved, uttered a deep sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How hard you are breathing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div>said Madame Homais.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see, it's rather warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied.

<p/>So the next day they talked over how to arrange their rendezvous. Emma
wanted to bribe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) servant with a present, but it would be better to
find some safe house at Yonville. Rodolphe promised to look for one.

<p/>All through the winter, three or four times a week, in the dead of night
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) came to the garden. Emma had on purpose taken away the key of the
gate, which Charles thought lost.

<p/>To call her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), Rodolphe threw a sprinkle of sand at the shutters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
jumped up with a start; but sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had to wait, for Charles had a
mania for chatting by the fireside, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would not stop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was wild
with impatience; if her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes could have done it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have hurled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) out at the window. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would begin to undress, then take up
a book, and go on reading very quietly as if the book amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). But
Charles, who was in bed, called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to come too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now, Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Then, as the candles dazzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) turned to the wall and fell asleep.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) escaped, smiling, palpitating, undressed. Rodolphe had a large
cloak; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) wrapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in it, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) waist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) without a word to the end of the garden.

<p/>It was in the arbour, on the same seat of old sticks where formerly Leon
had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so amorously on the summer evenings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) never thought
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) now.

<p/>The stars shone through the leafless jasmine branches. Behind them they
heard the river flowing, and now and again on the bank the rustling
of the dry reeds. Masses of shadow here and there loomed out in the
darkness, and sometimes, vibrating with one movement, they rose up and
swayed like immense black waves pressing forward to engulf them. The
cold of the nights made them clasp closer; the sighs of their lips
seemed to them deeper; their eyes that they could hardly see, larger;
and in the midst of the silence low words were spoken that fell on
their souls sonorous, crystalline, and that reverberated in multiplied
vibrations.

<p/>When the night was rainy, they took refuge in the consulting-room
between the cart-shed and the stable. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lighted one of the kitchen
candles that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had hidden behind the books. Rodolphe settled down
there as if at home. The sight of the library, of the bureau, of the
whole apartment, in fine, excited his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) merriment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) could not
refrain from making jokes about Charles, which rather embarrassed Emma.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have liked to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) more serious, and even on occasions
more dramatic; as, for example, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard a noise of
approaching steps in the alley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Someone is coming!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) blew out the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you your pistols?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to defend yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>replied Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From your husband? Oh, poor devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>And Rodolphe finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) sentence
with a gesture that said, <div class="bookquote">``I could crush him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) with a flip of my finger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was wonder-stricken at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) bravery, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt in it a sort
of indecency and a naive coarseness that scandalised her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>Rodolphe reflected a good deal on the affair of the pistols. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
spoken seriously, it was very ridiculous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) thought, even odious; for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had no reason to hate the good Charles, not being what is called
devoured by jealousy; and on this subject Emma had taken a great vow
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not think in the best of taste.

<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was growing very sentimental. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had insisted on
exchanging miniatures; they had cut off handfuls of hair, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was asking for a ring--a real wedding-ring, in sign of an eternal union.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) often spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) of the evening chimes, of the voices of nature.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother--hers! and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother--his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)!
Rodolphe had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) twenty years ago. Emma none the less consoled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) with caressing words as one would have done a lost child, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
sometimes even said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), gazing at the moon--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure that above there together they approve of our love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so pretty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had possessed so few women of such
ingenuousness. This love without debauchery was a new experience for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), and, drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) lazy habits, caressed at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) pride
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) sensuality. Emma's enthusiasm, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) bourgeois good sense
disdained, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) heart of hearts charming, since it
was lavished on him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>). Then, sure of being loved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) no longer kept up
appearances, and insensibly his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) ways changed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had no longer, as formerly, words so gentle that they made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cry,
nor passionate caresses that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mad, so that their great love,
which engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life, seemed to lessen beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) like the water of
a stream absorbed into its channel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could see the bed of it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not believe it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) redoubled in tenderness, and Rodolphe
concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) indifference less and less.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) regretted having yielded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
did not wish, on the contrary, to enjoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) the more. The humiliation
of feeling herself weak was turning to rancour, tempered by their
voluptuous pleasures. It was not affection; it was like a continual
seduction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) subjugated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) almost feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>).

<p/>Appearances, nevertheless, were calmer than ever, Rodolphe having
succeeded in carrying out the adultery after his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) own fancy; and at the
end of six months, when the spring-time came, they were to one another
like a married couple, tranquilly keeping up a domestic flame.

<p/>It was the time of year when old Rouault sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) turkey in remembrance
of the setting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) leg. The present always arrived with a letter.
Emma cut the string that tied it to the basket, and read the following
lines:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Dear Children--I hope this will find you well, and that this one
will be as good as the others. For it seems to me a little more tender,
if I may venture to say so, and heavier. But next time, for a change,
I'll give you a turkeycock, unless you have a preference for some dabs;
and send me back the hamper, if you please, with the two old ones. I
have had an accident with my cart-sheds, whose covering flew off one
windy night among the trees. The harvest has not been overgood either.
Finally, I don't know when I shall come to see you. It is so difficult
now to leave the house since I am alone, my poor Emma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Here there was a break in the lines, as if the old fellow had dropped
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pen to dream a little while.

<p/>``For myself, I am very well, except for a cold I caught the other day at
the fair at Yvetot, where I had gone to hire a shepherd, having turned
away mine because he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was too dainty. How we are to be pitied with such
a lot of thieves! Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was also rude. I heard from a pedlar, who,
travelling through your part of the country this winter, had a tooth
drawn, that Bovary was as usual working hard. That doesn't surprise me;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) showed me his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) tooth; we had some coffee together. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) if
he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) had seen you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) said not, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) had seen two horses in the
stables, from which I conclude that business is looking up. So much
the better, my dear children, and may God send you every imaginable
happiness! It grieves me not yet to have seen my dear little
grand-daughter, Berthe Bovary. I have planted an Orleans plum-tree for
her (<font color='blue'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>) in the garden under your room, and I won't have it touched unless it
is to have jam made for her (<font color='blue'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>) by and bye, that I will keep in the cupboard
for her (<font color='blue'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>) comes.

<p/>``Good-bye, my dear children. I kiss you, my girl, you too, my
son-in-law, and the little one on both cheeks. I am, with best
compliments, your loving father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Theodore Rouault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) held the coarse paper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fingers for some minutes. The spelling
mistakes were interwoven one with the other, and Emma followed the
kindly thought that cackled right through it like a hen half hidden
in the hedge of thorns. The writing had been dried with ashes from
the hearth, for a little grey powder slipped from the letter on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
dress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) almost thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father bending over the hearth
to take up the tongs. How long since she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), sitting on
the footstool in the chimney-corner, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) used to burn the end of
a bit of wood in the great flame of the sea-sedges! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) remembered the
summer evenings all full of sunshine. The colts neighed when anyone
passed by, and galloped, galloped. Under her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) window there was a beehive,
and sometimes the bees wheeling round in the light struck against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
window like rebounding balls of gold. What happiness there had been
at that time, what freedom, what hope! What an abundance of illusions!
Nothing was left of them now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had got rid of them all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul's
life, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) successive conditions of life, maidenhood, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) marriage,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) love--thus constantly losing them all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life through, like
a traveller who leaves something of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) wealth at every inn along his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
road.

<p/>But what then, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so unhappy? What was the extraordinary
catastrophe that had transformed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, looking
round as if to seek the cause of that which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suffer.

<p/>An April ray was dancing on the china of the whatnot; the fire burned;
beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) slippers she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt the softness of the carpet; the day was
bright, the air warm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) child shouting with laughter.

<p/>In fact, the little girl was just then rolling on the lawn in the midst
of the grass that was being turned. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was lying flat on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stomach
at the top of a rick. The servant was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skirt.
Lestiboudois was raking by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side, and every time he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) came near she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
lent forward, beating the air with both her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, rushing to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How I love
you, my poor child! How I love you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then noticing that the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ears were rather dirty, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rang at
once for warm water, and washed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), changed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) linen, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stockings,
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoes, asked a thousand questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) health, as if on the
return from a long journey, and finally, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again and crying
a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back to the servant, who stood quite
thunderstricken at this excess of tenderness.

<p/>That evening Rodolphe found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more serious than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will pass over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) concluded; <div class="bookquote">``it's a whim:''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) missed three rendezvous running. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) did come, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) showed
herself cold and almost contemptuous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you're losing your time, my lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) pretended not to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) melancholy sighs, nor the
handkerchief she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took out.

<p/>Then Emma repented. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even asked herself why she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) detested Charles; if
it had not been better to have been able to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
no opportunities for such a revival of sentiment, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was much
embarrassed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) desire for sacrifice, when the druggist came just in
time to provide her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with an opportunity.



<p/>Chapter Eleven

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had recently read a eulogy on a new method for curing club-foot, and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was a partisan of progress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) conceived the patriotic idea that
Yonville, in order to keep to the fore, ought to have some operations
for strephopody or club-foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to Emma, <div class="bookquote">``what risk is there? See--''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enumerated
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fingers the advantages of the attempt-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``success, almost certain
relief and beautifying of the patient, celebrity acquired by the
operator. Why, for example, should not your husband relieve poor
Hippolyte of the `Lion d’Or'? Note that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not fail to tell about
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cure to all the travellers, and then''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Homais lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) voice and
looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``who is to prevent me from sending a short paragraph
on the subject to the paper? Eh! goodness me! an article gets about; it
is talked of; it ends by making a snowball! And who knows? who knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, Bovary might succeed. Nothing proved to Emma that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was not
clever; and what a satisfaction for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to have urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to a step by
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reputation and fortune would be increased! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only wished to
lean on something more solid than love.

<p/>Charles, urged by the druggist and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), allowed himself to be
persuaded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent to Rouen for Dr. Duval's volume, and every evening,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head between both hands, plunged into the reading of it.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was studying equinus, varus, and valgus, that is to say,
katastrephopody, endostrephopody, and exostrephopody -LRB-or better, the
various turnings of the foot downwards, inwards, and outwards, with the
hypostrephopody and anastrephopody-RRB-, otherwise torsion downwards and
upwards, Monsier Homais, with all sorts of arguments, was exhorting the
lad at the inn to submit to the operation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will scarcely feel, probably, a slight pain; it is a simple prick,
like a little blood-letting, less than the extraction of certain corns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hippolyte</b></font>)</div><p/>Hippolyte, reflecting, rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) stupid eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>continued the chemist, <div class="bookquote">``it doesn't concern me. It's for your
sake, for pure humanity! I should like to see you, my friend, rid of
your hideous caudication, together with that waddling of the lumbar
regions which, whatever you say, must considerably interfere with you in
the exercise of your calling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Homais represented to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) how much jollier and brisker he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would
feel afterwards, and even gave him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would be more
likely to please the women; and the stable-boy began to smile heavily.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) through his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) vanity:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you a man? Hang it! what would you have done if you had had to
go into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard? Ah! Hippolyte!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And Homais retired, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could not understand this
obstinacy, this blindness in refusing the benefactions of science.

<p/>The poor fellow gave way, for it was like a conspiracy. Binet, who never
interfered with other people's business, Madame Lefrancois, Artemise,
the neighbours, even the mayor, Monsieur Tuvache--everyone persuaded
him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>), lectured him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>), shamed him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>); but what finally decided him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) was that it
would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) nothing. Bovary even undertook to provide the machine
for the operation. This generosity was an idea of Emma's, and Charles
consented to it, thinking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heart of hearts that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife was an
angel.

<p/>So by the advice of the chemist, and after three fresh starts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had a
kind of box made by the carpenter, with the aid of the locksmith,
that weighed about eight pounds, and in which iron, wood, sheer-iron,
leather, screws, and nuts had not been spared.

<p/>But to know which of Hippolyte's tendons to cut, it was necessary first
of all to find out what kind of club-foot he (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) had.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) had a foot forming almost a straight line with the leg, which,
however, did not prevent it from being turned in, so that it was an
equinus together with something of a varus, or else a slight varus with
a strong tendency to equinus. But with this equinus, wide in foot like
a horse's hoof, with rugose skin, dry tendons, and large toes, on which
the black nails looked as if made of iron, the clubfoot ran about like
a deer from morn till night. He (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) was constantly to be seen on the Place,
jumping round the carts, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) limping foot forwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) seemed
even stronger on that leg than the other. By dint of hard service it had
acquired, as it were, moral qualities of patience and energy; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) was given some heavy work, he (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) stood on it in preference to its
fellow.

<p/>Now, as it was an equinus, it was necessary to cut the tendon of
Achilles, and, if need were, the anterior tibial muscle could be seen to
afterwards for getting rid of the varus; for the doctor did not dare to
risk both operations at once; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was even trembling already for fear of
injuring some important region that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not know.

<p/>Neither Ambrose Pare, applying for the first time since Celsus, after an
interval of fifteen centuries, a ligature to an artery, nor Dupuytren,
about to open an abscess in the brain, nor Gensoul when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) first took
away the superior maxilla, had hearts that trembled, hands that shook,
minds so strained as Monsieur Bovary when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) approached Hippolyte, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>)
tenotome between his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) fingers. And as at hospitals, near by on a table
lay a heap of lint, with waxed thread, many bandages--a pyramid of
bandages--every bandage to be found at the druggist's. It was Monsieur
Homais who since morning had been organising all these preparations,
as much to dazzle the multitude as to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) illusions. Charles
pierced the skin; a dry crackling was heard. The tendon was cut, the
operation over. Hippolyte could not get over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) surprise, but bent over
Bovary's hands to cover them with kisses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, be calm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>said the druggist; <div class="bookquote">``later on you will show your
gratitude to your benefactor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went down to tell the result to five or six inquirers who were
waiting in the yard, and who fancied that Hippolyte would reappear
walking properly. Then Charles, having buckled his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) patient into the
machine, went home, where Emma, all anxiety, awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at the door.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw herself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) neck; they sat down to table; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ate much,
and at dessert he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) even wanted to take a cup of coffee, a luxury he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) only
permitted himself on Sundays when there was company.

<p/>The evening was charming, full of prattle, of dreams together. They
talked about their future fortune, of the improvements to be made in
their house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw people's estimation of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) growing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) comforts
increasing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife always loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was happy to refresh
herself with a new sentiment, healthier, better, to feel at last some
tenderness for this poor fellow who adored her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The thought of Rodolphe
for one moment passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes turned again to
Charles; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) even noticed with surprise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not bad teeth.

<p/>They were in bed when Monsieur Homais, in spite of the servant, suddenly
entered the room, holding in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hand a sheet of paper just written. It
was the paragraph he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) intended for the <div class="bookquote">``Fanal de Rouen.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) brought it
for them to read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) read--

<p/>```Despite the prejudices that still invest a part of the face of Europe
like a net, the light nevertheless begins to penetrate our country
places. Thus on Tuesday our little town of Yonville found itself the
scene of a surgical operation which is at the same time an act of
loftiest philanthropy. Monsieur Bovary, one of our most distinguished
practitioners--'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that is too much! too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>practitioners</b></font>)</div>said Charles, choking with emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! not at all! What next!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>```--Performed an operation on a club-footed man.' I have not used the
scientific term, because you know in a newspaper everyone would not
perhaps understand. The masses must--'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>The masses</b></font>)</div>said Bovary; <div class="bookquote">``go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I proceed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist. ```Monsieur Bovary, one of our most
distinguished practitioners, performed an operation on a club-footed man
called Hippolyte Tautain, stableman for the last twenty-five years at
the hotel of the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>stableman</b></font>)</div>kept by Widow Lefrancois, at the Place
d’Armes. The novelty of the attempt, and the interest incident to the
subject, had attracted such a concourse of persons that there was
a veritable obstruction on the threshold of the establishment. The
operation, moreover, was performed as if by magic, and barely a
few drops of blood appeared on the skin, as though to say that the
rebellious tendon had at last given way beneath the efforts of art. The
patient, strangely enough--we affirm it as an eye-witness--complained
of no pain. His (<font color='blue'><b>eye-witness</b></font>) condition up to the present time leaves nothing to be
desired. Everything tends to show that his (<font color='blue'><b>eye-witness</b></font>) convelescence will be brief;
and who knows even if at our next village festivity we shall not see our
good Hippolyte figuring in the bacchic dance in the midst of a chorus
of joyous boon-companions, and thus proving to all eyes by his (<font color='blue'><b>eye-witness</b></font>) verve
and his (<font color='blue'><b>eye-witness</b></font>) capers his (<font color='blue'><b>eye-witness</b></font>) complete cure? Honour, then, to the generous savants!
Honour to those indefatigable spirits who consecrate their vigils to the
amelioration or to the alleviation of their kind! Honour, thrice honour!
Is it not time to cry that the blind shall see, the deaf hear, the lame
walk? But that which fanaticism formerly promised to its elect, science
now accomplishes for all men. We shall keep our readers informed as to
the successive phases of this remarkable cure.'''

<p/>This did not prevent Mere Lefrancois, from coming five days after,
scared, and crying out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help! he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) is dying! I am going crazy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mere Lefrancois</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles rushed to the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>and the chemist, who caught sight
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) passing along the Place hatless, abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) appeared
himself breathless, red, anxious, and asking everyone who was going up
the stairs--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter with our interesting strephopode?''

 (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>The strephopode was writhing in hideous convulsions, so that the machine
in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) leg was enclosed was knocked against the wall enough to
break it.

<p/>With many precautions, in order not to disturb the position of the limb,
the box was removed, and an awful sight presented itself. The outlines
of the foot disappeared in such a swelling that the entire skin seemed
about to burst, and it was covered with ecchymosis, caused by the famous
machine. Hippolyte had already complained of suffering from it. No
attention had been paid to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); they had to acknowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not
been altogether wrong, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was freed for a few hours. But, hardly had
the oedema gone down to some extent, than the two savants thought fit
to put back the limb in the apparatus, strapping it tighter to hasten
matters. At last, three days after, Hippolyte being unable to endure it
any longer, they once more removed the machine, and were much surprised
at the result they saw. The livid tumefaction spread over the leg, with
blisters here and there, whence there oozed a black liquid. Matters
were taking a serious turn. Hippolyte began to worry himself, and Mere
Lefrancois, had him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) installed in the little room near the kitchen, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) might at least have some distraction.

<p/>But the tax-collector, who dined there every day, complained bitterly of
such companionship. Then Hippolyte was removed to the billiard-room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) lay there moaning under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) heavy coverings, pale with long beard,
sunken eyes, and from time to time turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) perspiring head on the
dirty pillow, where the flies alighted. Madame Bovary went to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) linen for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) poultices; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) comforted, and encouraged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>). Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) did not want for company, especially on market-days,
when the peasants were knocking about the billiard-balls round him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>),
fenced with the cues, smoked, drank, sang, and brawled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>they said, clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) on the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! you're not
up to much, it seems, but it's your own fault. You should do this! do
that!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And then they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) stories of people who had all been cured
by other remedies than his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>). Then by way of consolation they added--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You give way too much! Get up! You coddle yourself like a king! All the
same, old chap, you don't smell nice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Gangrene, in fact, was spreading more and more. Bovary himself turned
sick at it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) came every hour, every moment. Hippolyte looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>)
with eyes full of terror, sobbing--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When shall I get well? Oh, save me! How unfortunate I am! How
unfortunate I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And the doctor left, always recommending him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to diet himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mere Lefrancois</b></font>)</div>said Mere Lefrancois, <div class="bookquote">``Haven't they
tortured you enough already? You'll grow still weaker. Here! swallow
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mere Lefrancois</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) some good beef-tea, a slice of mutton, a piece of
bacon, and sometimes small glasses of brandy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) had not the
strength to put to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) lips.

<p/>Abbe Bournisien, hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) was growing worse, asked to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) began by pitying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) sufferings, declaring at the same time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>)
ought to rejoice at them since it was the will of the Lord, and take
advantage of the occasion to reconcile himself to Heaven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the ecclesiastic in a paternal tone, <div class="bookquote">``you rather neglected
your duties; you were rarely seen at divine worship. How many years is
it since you approached the holy table? I understand that your work,
that the whirl of the world may have kept you from care for your
salvation. But now is the time to reflect. Yet don't despair. I have
known great sinners, who, about to appear before God -LRB-you are not yet
at this point I know-RRB-, had implored His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercy, and who certainly died in
the best frame of mind. Let us hope that, like them, you will set us a
good example. Thus, as a precaution, what is to prevent you from saying
morning and evening a `Hail Mary, full of grace,' and `Our Father which
art in heaven'? Yes, do that, for my sake, to oblige me. That won't cost
you anything. Will you promise me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The devil</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor devil promised. The cure came back day after day. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) chatted
with the landlady; and even told anecdotes interspersed with jokes and
puns that Hippolyte did not understand. Then, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
fell back upon matters of religion, putting on an appropriate expression
of face.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) zeal seemed successful, for the club-foot soon manifested a desire
to go on a pilgrimage to Bon-Secours if he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) were cured; to which Monsieur
Bournisien replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) saw no objection; two precautions were better
than one; it was no risk anyhow.

<p/>The druggist was indignant at what he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) called the manoeuvres of the
priest; they were prejudicial, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) said, to Hippolyte's convalescence,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) kept repeating to Madame Lefrancois, <div class="bookquote">``Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) alone! leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
alone! You perturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) morals with your mysticism.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lefrancois/Lefrancois</b></font>)</div>But the good woman
would no longer listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) was the cause of it all. From a spirit
of contradiction she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hung up near the bedside of the patient a basin
filled with holy-water and a branch of box.

<p/>Religion, however, seemed no more able to succour him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) than surgery, and
the invincible gangrene still spread from the extremities towards
the stomach. It was all very well to vary the potions and change the
poultices; the muscles each day rotted more and more; and at last
Charles replied by an affirmative nod of the head when Mere Lefrancois,
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not, as a forlorn hope, send for Monsieur Canivet
of Neufchatel, who was a celebrity.

<p/>A doctor of medicine, fifty years of age, enjoying a good position
and self-possessed, Charles's colleague did not refrain from laughing
disdainfully when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had uncovered the leg, mortified to the knee. Then
having flatly declared that it must be amputated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went off to the
chemist's to rail at the asses who could have reduced a poor man to such
a state. Shaking Monsieur Homais by the button of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted
out in the shop--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are the inventions of Paris! These are the ideas of those gentry
of the capital! It is like strabismus, chloroform, lithotrity, a heap of
monstrosities that the Government ought to prohibit. But they want to do
the clever, and they cram you with remedies without, troubling about
the consequences. We are not so clever, not we! We are not savants,
coxcombs, fops! We are practitioners; we cure people, and we should
not dream of operating on anyone who is in perfect health. Straighten
club-feet! As if one could straighten club-feet! It is as if one wished,
for example, to make a hunchback straight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Homais suffered as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened to this discourse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
discomfort beneath a courtier's smile; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed to humour Monsier
Canivet, whose prescriptions sometimes came as far as Yonville. So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
did not take up the defence of Bovary; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not even make a single
remark, and, renouncing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) principles, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sacrificed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dignity to the
more serious interests of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business.

<p/>This amputation of the thigh by Doctor Canivet was a great event in the
village. On that day all the inhabitants got up earlier, and the Grande
Rue, although full of people, had something lugubrious about it, as
if an execution had been expected. At the grocer's they discussed
Hippolyte's illness; the shops did no business, and Madame Tuvache, the
mayor's wife, did not stir from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) window, such was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) impatience to
see the operator arrive.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) came in his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) gig, which he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) drove himself. But the springs of the right
side having at length given way beneath the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) corpulence, it
happened that the carriage as it rolled along leaned over a little, and
on the other cushion near him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) could be seen a large box covered in red
sheep-leather, whose three brass clasps shone grandly.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) had entered like a whirlwind the porch of the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the
doctor, shouting very loud, ordered them to unharness his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) horse. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
went into the stable to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) was eating her (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) oats all right; for
on arriving at a patient's he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) first of all looked after his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) mare and his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
gig. People even said about this--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Monsieur Canivet's a character!''

 (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was the more esteemed for this imperturbable coolness. The
universe to the last man might have died, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have missed
the smallest of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) habits.

<p/>Homais presented himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I count on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``Are we ready? Come along!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>But the druggist, turning red, confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was too sensitive to
assist at such an operation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When one is a simple spectator,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the imagination, you know,
is impressed. And then I have such a nervous system!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interrupted Canivet; <div class="bookquote">``on the contrary, you seem to me inclined
to apoplexy. Besides, that doesn't astonish me, for you chemist fellows
are always poking about your kitchens, which must end by spoiling your
constitutions. Now just look at me. I get up every day at four o’clock;
I shave with cold water -LRB-and am never cold-RRB-. I don't wear flannels, and
I never catch cold; my carcass is good enough! I live now in one way,
now in another, like a philosopher, taking pot-luck; that is why I
am not squeamish like you, and it is as indifferent to me to carve a
Christian as the first fowl that turns up. Then, perhaps, you will say,
habit! habit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hippolyte</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, without any consideration for Hippolyte, who was sweating with
agony between his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sheets, these gentlemen entered into a conversation,
in which the druggist compared the coolness of a surgeon to that of a
general; and this comparison was pleasing to Canivet, who launched out
on the exigencies of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) art. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) looked upon, it as a sacred office,
although the ordinary practitioners dishonoured it. At last, coming back
to the patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) examined the bandages brought by Homais, the same
that had appeared for the club-foot, and asked for someone to hold the
limb for him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). Lestiboudois was sent for, and Monsieur Canivet having
turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) sleeves, passed into the billiard-room, while the druggist
stayed with Artemise and the landlady, both whiter than their aprons,
and with ears strained towards the door.

<p/>Bovary during this time did not dare to stir from his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) kept downstairs in the sitting-room by the side of the fireless
chimney, his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) breast, his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) hands clasped, his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) eyes staring.
<div class="bookquote">``What a mishap!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``what a mishap!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Perhaps, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had
made some slip. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) thought it over, but could hit upon nothing. But the
most famous surgeons also made mistakes; and that is what no one would
ever believe! People, on the contrary, would laugh, jeer! It would
spread as far as Forges, as Neufchatel, as Rouen, everywhere! Who could
say if his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) colleagues would not write against him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). Polemics would ensue;
he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) would have to answer in the papers. Hippolyte might even prosecute
him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) saw himself dishonoured, ruined, lost; and his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) imagination,
assailed by a world of hypotheses, tossed amongst them like an empty
cask borne by the sea and floating upon the waves.

<p/>Emma, opposite, watched him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not share his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) humiliation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt
another--that of having supposed such a man was worth anything. As if
twenty times already she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not sufficiently perceived his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mediocrity.

<p/>Charles was walking up and down the room; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) boots creaked on the
floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you fidget me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sat down again.

<p/>How was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), who was so intelligent--could have allowed
herself to be deceived again? and through what deplorable madness had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thus ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life by continual sacrifices? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recalled all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
instincts of luxury, all the privations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul, the sordidness of
marriage, of the household, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dream sinking into the mire like wounded
swallows; all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had longed for, all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had denied herself,
all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might have had! And for what? for what?

<p/>In the midst of the silence that hung over the village a heart-rending
cry rose on the air. Bovary turned white to fainting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knit her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
brows with a nervous gesture, then went on. And it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), for this
creature, for this man, who understood nothing, who felt nothing! For he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was there quite quiet, not even suspecting that the ridicule of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name
would henceforth sully hers as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had made efforts to love
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had repented with tears for having yielded to another!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was perhaps a valgus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>suddenly exclaimed Bovary, who was
meditating.

<p/>At the unexpected shock of this phrase falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought like a
leaden bullet on a silver plate, Emma, shuddering, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head in
order to find out what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant to say; and they looked at the other in
silence, almost amazed to see each other, so far sundered were they
by their inner thoughts. Charles gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with the dull look of
a drunken man, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) listened motionless to the last cries of the
sufferer, that followed each other in long-drawn modulations, broken by
sharp spasms like the far-off howling of some beast being slaughtered.
Emma bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wan lips, and rolling between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fingers a piece of coral
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had broken, fixed on Charles the burning glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes
like two arrows of fire about to dart forth. Everything in him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) irritated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) now; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dress, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whole person, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
existence, in fine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) repented of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) past virtue as of a crime, and
what still remained of it rumbled away beneath the furious blows of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
pride. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) revelled in all the evil ironies of triumphant adultery.
The memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lover came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with dazzling attractions; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whole soul into it, borne away towards this image with a fresh
enthusiasm; and Charles seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as much removed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life, as
absent forever, as impossible and annihilated, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been about
to die and were passing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>There was a sound of steps on the pavement. Charles looked up, and
through the lowered blinds he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw at the corner of the market in
the broad sunshine Dr. Canivet, who was wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brow with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
handkerchief. Homais, behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), was carrying a large red box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
hand, and both were going towards the chemist's.

<p/>Then with a feeling of sudden tenderness and discouragement Charles
turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, kiss me, my own!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, red with anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked, stupefied. <div class="bookquote">``Be calm; compose yourself.
You know well enough that I love you. Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cried with a terrible look.

<p/>And escaping from the room, Emma closed the door so violently that the
barometer fell from the wall and smashed on the floor.

<p/>Charles sank back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arm-chair overwhelmed, trying to discover
what could be wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), fancying some nervous illness, weeping,
and vaguely feeling something fatal and incomprehensible whirling round
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>When Rodolphe came to the garden that evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) mistress
waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) at the foot of the steps on the lowest stair. They threw
their arms round one another, and all their rancour melted like snow
beneath the warmth of that kiss.



<p/>Chapter Twelve

<p/>They began to love one another again. Often, even in the middle of the
day, Emma suddenly wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), then from the window made a sign to
Justin, who, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) apron off, quickly ran to La Huchette. Rodolphe
would come; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was bored, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband was odious, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life frightful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what can I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cried one day impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! if you would--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sitting on the floor between his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knees, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair loose, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) look
lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We would go and live elsewhere--somewhere!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are really mad!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said laughing. <div class="bookquote">``How could that be possible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) returned to the subject; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) pretended not to understand, and turned
the conversation.

<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) did not understand was all this worry about so simple an affair
as love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a motive, a reason, and, as it were, a pendant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
affection.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tenderness, in fact, grew each day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) repulsion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
husband. The more she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave up herself to the one, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) loathed
the other. Never had Charles seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so disagreeable, to have
such stodgy fingers, such vulgar ways, to be so dull as when they found
themselves together after her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meeting with Rodolphe. Then, while playing
the spouse and virtue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was burning at the thought of that head whose
black hair fell in a curl over the sunburnt brow, of that form at once
so strong and elegant, of that man, in a word, who had such experience
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reasoning, such passion in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desires. It was for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
filed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nails with the care of a chaser, and that there was never
enough cold-cream for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) skin, nor of patchouli for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) handkerchiefs.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) loaded herself with bracelets, rings, and necklaces. When he (<font color='blue'><b>chaser</b></font>)
was coming she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) filled the two large blue glass vases with roses, and
prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person like a courtesan expecting a prince.
The servant had to be constantly washing linen, and all day Felicite
did not stir from the kitchen, where little Justin, who often kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
company, watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at work.

<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) elbows on the long board on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was ironing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>)
greedily watched all these women's clothes spread about him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>), the dimity
petticoats, the fichus, the collars, and the drawers with running
strings, wide at the hips and growing narrower below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>asked the young fellow, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand over the
crinoline or the hooks and eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, haven't you ever seen anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felicite</b></font>)</div>Felicite answered laughing. <div class="bookquote">``As
if your mistress, Madame Homais, didn't wear the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I daresay! Madame Homais!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) added with a meditative air, <div class="bookquote">``As
if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) were a lady like madame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Felicite grew impatient of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hanging round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was six
years older than he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and Theodore, Monsieur Guillaumin's servant, was
beginning to pay court to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pot of starch. <div class="bookquote">``You'd better be
off and pound almonds; you are always dangling about women. Before you
meddle with such things, bad boy, wait till you've got a beard to your
chin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't be cross! I'll go and clean her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) boots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at once took down from the shelf Emma's boots, all coated with
mud, the mud of the rendezvous, that crumbled into powder beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
fingers, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) watched as it gently rose in a ray of sunlight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How afraid you are of spoiling them!''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>said the servant, who wasn't so
particular when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cleaned them herself, because as soon as the stuff
of the boots was no longer fresh madame handed them over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>Emma had a number in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cupboard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) squandered one after the
other, without Charles allowing himself the slightest observation. So
also he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) disbursed three hundred francs for a wooden leg that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought
proper to make a present of to Hippolyte. Its top was covered with cork,
and it had spring joints, a complicated mechanism, covered over by black
trousers ending in a patent-leather boot. But Hippolyte, not daring
to use such a handsome leg every day, begged Madame Bovary to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
another more convenient one. The doctor, of course, had again to defray
the expense of this purchase.

<p/>So little by little the stable-man took up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) work again. One saw him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
running about the village as before, and when Charles heard from afar
the sharp noise of the wooden leg, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at once went in another direction.

<p/>It was Monsieur Lheureux, the shopkeeper, who had undertaken the order;
this provided him (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) with an excuse for visiting Emma. He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) chatted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
about the new goods from Paris, about a thousand feminine trifles, made
himself very obliging, and never asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) money. Emma yielded to
this lazy mode of satisfying all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caprices. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to have
a very handsome ridding-whip that was at an umbrella-maker's at Rouen
to give to Rodolphe. The week after Monsieur Lheureux placed it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
table.

<p/>But the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a bill for two hundred and
seventy francs, not counting the centimes. Emma was much embarrassed;
all the drawers of the writing-table were empty; they owed over a
fortnight's wages to Lestiboudois, two quarters to the servant, for any
quantity of other things, and Bovary was impatiently expecting Monsieur
Derozeray's account, which he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was in the habit of paying every year
about Midsummer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) succeeded at first in putting off Lheureux. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) lost
patience; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was being sued; his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) capital was out, and unless he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) got some
in he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) should be forced to take back all the goods she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well, take them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only joking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``the only thing I regret is the whip.
My word! I'll ask monsieur to return it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I've got you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>thought Lheureux.

<p/>And, certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) discovery, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went out repeating to himself in an
undertone, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) usual low whistle--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! we shall see! we shall see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was thinking how to get out of this when the servant coming in
put on the mantelpiece a small roll of blue paper <div class="bookquote">``from Monsieur
Derozeray's.''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>Emma pounced upon and opened it. It contained fifteen
napoleons; it was the account. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard Charles on the stairs; threw
the gold to the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drawer, and took out the key.

<p/>Three days after Lheureux reappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have an arrangement to suggest to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If, instead of the
sum agreed on, you would take--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said placing fourteen napoleons in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand.

<p/>The tradesman was dumfounded. Then, to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) disappointment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was profuse in apologies and proffers of service, all of which Emma
declined; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) remained a few moments fingering in the pocket of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) apron the two five-franc pieces that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in change.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) promised herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would economise in order to pay back later on.
<div class="bookquote">``Pshaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) won't think about it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Besides the riding-whip with its silver-gilt handle, Rodolphe had
received a seal with the motto Amor nel cor* furthermore, a scarf for
a muffler, and, finally, a cigar-case exactly like the Viscount's, that
Charles had formerly picked up in the road, and that Emma had kept.
These presents, however, humiliated him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) refused several; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
insisted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ended by obeying, thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tyrannical and
overexacting.

<p/>*A loving heart.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had strange ideas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When midnight strikes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you must think of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), there were floods of
reproaches that always ended with the eternal question--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course I love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't loved any others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you think you'd got a virgin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) exclaimed laughing.

<p/>Emma cried, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), adorning his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) protestations with
puns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I love you! I love you so that I could not live
without you, do you see? There are times when I long to see you again,
when I am torn by all the anger of love. I ask myself, Where is
he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)? Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is talking to other women. They smile upon him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
approaches. Oh no; no one else pleases you. There are some more
beautiful, but I love you best. I know how to love best. I am your
servant, your concubine! You are my king, my idol! You are good, you are
beautiful, you are clever, you are strong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had so often heard these things said that they did not strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as
original. Emma was like all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mistresses; and the charm of novelty,
gradually falling away like a garment, laid bare the eternal monotony
of passion, that has always the same forms and the same language. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
did not distinguish, this man of so much experience, the difference of
sentiment beneath the sameness of expression. Because lips libertine
and venal had murmured such words to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) believed but little in the
candour of hers; exaggerated speeches hiding mediocre affections must be
discounted; as if the fullness of the soul did not sometimes overflow in
the emptiest metaphors, since no one can ever give the exact measure of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) needs, nor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) conceptions, nor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sorrows; and since human
speech is like a cracked tin kettle, on which we hammer out tunes to
make bears dance when we long to move the stars.

<p/>But with that superior critical judgment that belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) who, in no
matter what circumstance, holds back, Rodolphe saw other delights to be
got out of this love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) thought all modesty in the way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
quite sans facon.* He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) something supple and corrupt. Hers
was an idiotic sort of attachment, full of admiration for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), of
voluptuousness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), a beatitude that benumbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) soul sank
into this drunkenness, shrivelled up, drowned in it, like Clarence in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) butt of Malmsey.

<p/>*Off-handedly.


<p/>By the mere effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) love Madame Bovary's manners changed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looks grew bolder, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) speech more free; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) even committed the
impropriety of walking out with Monsieur Rodolphe, a cigarette in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
mouth, <div class="bookquote">``as if to defy the people.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>At last, those who still doubted
doubted no longer when one day they saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) getting out of the
<div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) waist squeezed into a waistcoat like a man; and Madame
Bovary senior, who, after a fearful scene with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) husband, had taken
refuge at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) son's, was not the least scandalised of the women-folk.
Many other things displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). First, Charles had not attended to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) advice about the forbidding of novels; then the <div class="bookquote">``ways of the house''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) allowed herself to make some remarks, and there were
quarrels, especially one on account of Felicite.

<p/>Madame Bovary senior, the evening before, passing along the passage,
had surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in company of a man--a man with a brown collar, about
forty years old, who, at the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) step, had quickly escaped
through the kitchen. Then Emma began to laugh, but the good lady grew
angry, declaring that unless morals were to be laughed at one ought to
look after those of one's servants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where were you brought up?''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughter-in-law</b></font>)</div>asked the daughter-in-law, with so
impertinent a look that Madame Bovary asked her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) were not perhaps
defending her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) own case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave the room!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman, springing up with a bound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma! Mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>cried Charles, trying to reconcile them.

<p/>But both had fled in their exasperation. Emma was stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feet as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) repeated--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! what manners! What a peasant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was beside herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stammered

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is an insolent, giddy-headed thing, or perhaps worse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was for leaving at once if the other did not apologise. So
Charles went back again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife and implored her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to give way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
knelt to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ended by saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! I'll go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And in fact she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother-in-law with the dignity
of a marchioness as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, madame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, having gone up again to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) threw herself flat on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
bed and cried there like a child, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face buried in the pillow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Rodolphe had agreed that in the event of anything extraordinary
occurring, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should fasten a small piece of white paper to the blind,
so that if by chance he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) happened to be in Yonville, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) could hurry to
the lane behind the house. Emma made the signal; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been waiting
three-quarters of an hour when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suddenly caught sight of Rodolphe at
the corner of the market. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt tempted to open the window and call
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had already disappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell back in despair.

<p/>Soon, however, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that someone was walking on the
pavement. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), no doubt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went downstairs, crossed the yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
was there outside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do take care!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! if you knew!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) everything, hurriedly, disjointedly,
exaggerating the facts, inventing many, and so prodigal of parentheses
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) understood nothing of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, my poor angel, courage! Be comforted! be patient!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have been patient; I have suffered for four years. A love like
ours ought to show itself in the face of heaven. They torture me! I can
bear it no longer! Save me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) clung to Rodolphe. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, full of tears, flashed like flames
beneath a wave; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breast heaved; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had never loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so much, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) head and said <div class="bookquote">``What is, it? What do you wish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take me away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``carry me off! Oh, I pray you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw herself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) mouth, as if to seize there the
unexpected consent if breathed forth in a kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>Rodolphe resumed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your little girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reflected a few moments, then replied--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! It can't be helped!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said to himself, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had run into the garden. Someone was calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>On the following days Madame Bovary senior was much surprised at the
change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) daughter-in-law. Emma, in fact, was showing herself more
docile, and even carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) deference so far as to ask for a recipe for
pickling gherkins.

<p/>Was it the better to deceive them both? Or did she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wish by a sort of
voluptuous stoicism to feel the more profoundly the bitterness of the
things she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was about to leave?

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) paid no heed to them; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lived as lost in the
anticipated delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) coming happiness.

<p/>It was an eternal subject for conversation with Rodolphe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leant on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) shoulder murmuring--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! when we are in the mail-coach! Do you think about it? Can it be? It
seems to me that the moment I feel the carriage start, it will be as if
we were rising in a balloon, as if we were setting out for the clouds.
Do you know that I count the hours? And you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Never had Madame Bovary been so beautiful as at this period; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
that indefinable beauty that results from joy, from enthusiasm, from
success, and that is only the harmony of temperament with circumstances.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) desires, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sorrows, the experience of pleasure, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ever-young
illusions, that had, as soil and rain and winds and the sun make flowers
grow, gradually developed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at length blossomed forth in all
the plenitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nature. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyelids seemed chiselled expressly for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) long amorous looks in which the pupil disappeared, while a strong
inspiration expanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) delicate nostrils and raised the fleshy corner
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips, shaded in the light by a little black down. One would have
thought that an artist apt in conception had arranged the curls of hair
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neck; they fell in a thick mass, negligently, and with the
changing chances of their adultery, that unbound them every day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
voice now took more mellow infections, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) figure also; something subtle
and penetrating escaped even from the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gown and from the
line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) foot. Charles, as when they were first married, thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
delicious and quite irresistible.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came home in the middle of the night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not dare to wake
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The porcelain night-light threw a round trembling gleam upon the
ceiling, and the drawn curtains of the little cot formed as it were a
white hut standing out in the shade, and by the bedside Charles looked
at them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) seemed to hear the light breathing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would
grow big now; every season would bring rapid progress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) already saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) coming from school as the day drew in, laughing, with ink-stains on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) jacket, and carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) basket on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have to
be sent to the boarding-school; that would cost much; how was it to
be done? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reflected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought of hiring a small farm in the
neighbourhood, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would superintend every morning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
patients. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would save up what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brought in; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would put it in the
savings-bank. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would buy shares somewhere, no matter where;
besides, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) practice would increase; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) counted upon that, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wanted Berthe to be well-educated, to be accomplished, to learn to play
the piano. Ah! how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would be later on when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was fifteen,
when, resembling her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), wear large straw hats
in the summer-time; from a distance they would be taken for two sisters.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to himself working in the evening by their side beneath
the light of the lamp; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would embroider him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) slippers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would look
after the house; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would fill all the home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) charm and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
gaiety. At last, they would think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) marriage; they would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
some good young fellow with a steady business; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) happy;
this would last for ever.

<p/>Emma was not asleep; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pretended to be; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) dozed off by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
side she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) awakened to other dreams.

<p/>To the gallop of four horses she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was carried away for a week towards a
new land, whence they would return no more. They went on and on, their
arms entwined, without a word. Often from the top of a mountain there
suddenly glimpsed some splendid city with domes, and bridges, and
ships, forests of citron trees, and cathedrals of white marble, on whose
pointed steeples were storks' nests. They went at a walking-pace because
of the great flag-stones, and on the ground there were bouquets of
flowers, offered you by women dressed in red bodices. They heard the
chiming of bells, the neighing of mules, together with the murmur of
guitars and the noise of fountains, whose rising spray refreshed heaps
of fruit arranged like a pyramid at the foot of pale statues that smiled
beneath playing waters. And then, one night they came to a fishing
village, where brown nets were drying in the wind along the cliffs and
in front of the huts. It was there that they would stay; they would live
in a low, flat-roofed house, shaded by a palm-tree, in the heart of a
gulf, by the sea. They would row in gondolas, swing in hammocks, and
their existence would be easy and large as their silk gowns, warm and
star-spangled as the nights they would contemplate. However, in the
immensity of this future that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) conjured up, nothing special stood
forth; the days, all magnificent, resembled each other like waves; and
it swayed in the horizon, infinite, harmonised, azure, and bathed in
sunshine. But the child began to cough in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) cot or Bovary snored
more loudly, and Emma did not fall asleep till morning, when the dawn
whitened the windows, and when little Justin was already in the square
taking down the shutters of the chemist's shop.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had sent for Monsieur Lheureux, and had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want a cloak--a large lined cloak with a deep collar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going on a journey?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but--never mind. I may count on you, may I not, and quickly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, I shall want,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``a trunk--not too heavy--handy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I understand. About three feet by a foot and a half, as they
are being made just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a travelling bag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>thought Lheureux, <div class="bookquote">``there's a row on here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Madame Bovary, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) watch from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) belt, <div class="bookquote">``take this;
you can pay yourself out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/>But the tradesman cried out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was wrong; they knew one another;
did he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)? What childishness!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) insisted, however, on his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) taking at least the chain, and Lheureux
had already put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) pocket and was going, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>)
back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will leave everything at your place. As to the cloak'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed
to be reflecting--<div class="bookquote">``do not bring it either; you can give me the maker's
address, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to have it ready for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the next month that they were to run away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to leave
Yonville as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was going on some business to Rouen. Rodolphe would
have booked the seats, procured the passports, and even have written to
Paris in order to have the whole mail-coach reserved for them as far as
Marseilles, where they would buy a carriage, and go on thence without
stopping to Genoa. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would take care to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) luggage to Lheureux
whence it would be taken direct to the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>so that no one
would have any suspicion. And in all this there never was any allusion
to the child. Rodolphe avoided speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) no longer
thought about it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) wished to have two more weeks before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) to arrange some affairs;
then at the end of a week he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) wanted two more; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was ill;
next he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) went on a journey. The month of August passed, and, after all
these delays, they decided that it was to be irrevocably fixed for the
4th September--a Monday.

<p/>At length the Saturday before arrived.

<p/>Rodolphe came in the evening earlier than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they walked round a garden-bed, and went to sit down near the
terrace on the kerb-stone of the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) strangely in a tender fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because you are going away?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``because you are
leaving what is dear to you--your life? Ah! I understand. I have nothing
in the world! you are all to me; so shall I be to you. I will be your
people, your country; I will tend, I will love you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How sweet you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said, seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said with a voluptuous laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Do you love me? Swear it
then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I love you--love you? I adore you, my love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The moon, full and purple-coloured, was rising right out of the earth
at the end of the meadow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rose quickly between the branches of the
poplars, that hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) here and there like a black curtain pierced with
holes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) appeared dazzling with whiteness in the empty heavens
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lit up, and now sailing more slowly along, let fall upon the
river a great stain that broke up into an infinity of stars; and the
silver sheen seemed to writhe through the very depths like a heedless
serpent covered with luminous scales; it also resembled some monster
candelabra all along which sparkled drops of diamonds running together.
The soft night was about them; masses of shadow filled the branches.
Emma, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes half closed, breathed in with deep sighs the fresh wind
that was blowing. They did not speak, lost as they were in the rush of
their reverie. The tenderness of the old days came back to their hearts,
full and silent as the flowing river, with the softness of the perfume
of the syringas, and threw across their memories shadows more immense
and more sombre than those of the still willows that lengthened out over
the grass. Often some night-animal, hedgehog or weasel, setting out on
the hunt, disturbed the lovers, or sometimes they heard a ripe peach
falling all alone from the espalier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! what a lovely night!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>said Rodolphe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; and, as if speaking to herself:
<div class="bookquote">``Yet, it will be good to travel. And yet, why should my heart be
so heavy? Is it dread of the unknown? The effect of habits left? Or
rather--? No; it is the excess of happiness. How weak I am, am I not?
Forgive me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is still time!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Reflect! perhaps you may repent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried impetuously. And coming closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``What ill
could come to me? There is no desert, no precipice, no ocean I would not
traverse with you. The longer we live together the more it will be like
an embrace, every day closer, more heart to heart. There will be
nothing to trouble us, no cares, no obstacle. We shall be alone, all to
ourselves eternally. Oh, speak! Answer me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>At regular intervals he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes--Yes--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) repeated in a childlike voice, despite the big
tears which were falling, <div class="bookquote">``Rodolphe! Rodolphe! Ah! Rodolphe! dear little
Rodolphe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Midnight struck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Midnight!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come, it is to-morrow. One day more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) rose to go; and as if the movement he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) made had been the signal for
their flight, Emma said, suddenly assuming a gay air--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have the passports?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are forgetting nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is at the Hotel de Provence, is it not, that you will wait for me at
midday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till to-morrow then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma in a last caress; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
go.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) did not turn round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), and, leaning over the water's
edge between the bulrushes--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was already on the other side of the river and walking fast across
the meadow.

<p/>After a few moments Rodolphe stopped; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) white
gown gradually fade away in the shade like a ghost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was seized with
such a beating of the heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) leant against a tree lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) should
fall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an imbecile I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said with a fearful oath. <div class="bookquote">``No matter! She (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>)
was a pretty mistress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>And immediately Emma's beauty, with all the pleasures of their love,
came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>). For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) softened; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) rebelled against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) exclaimed, gesticulating, <div class="bookquote">``I can't exile
myself--have a child on my hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was saying these things to give himself firmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And besides, the worry, the expense! Ah! no, no, no, no! a thousand
times no! That would be too stupid.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter Thirteen

<p/>No sooner was Rodolphe at home than he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) sat down quickly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) bureau
under the stag's head that hung as a trophy on the wall. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had
the pen between his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) fingers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) could think of nothing, so that, resting
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) elbows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) began to reflect. Emma seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) to have receded
into a far-off past, as if the resolution he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had taken had suddenly
placed a distance between them.

<p/>To get back something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) fetched from the cupboard at the
bedside an old Rheims biscuit-box, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) usually kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) letters
from women, and from it came an odour of dry dust and withered
roses. First he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) saw a handkerchief with pale little spots. It was a
handkerchief of hers. Once when they were walking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nose had bled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
had forgotten it. Near it, chipped at all the corners, was a miniature
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) by Emma: her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) toilette seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) pretentious, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
languishing look in the worst possible taste. Then, from looking at this
image and recalling the memory of its original, Emma's features little
by little grew confused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) remembrance, as if the living and the
painted face, rubbing one against the other, had effaced each other.
Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) read some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) letters; they were full of explanations
relating to their journey, short, technical, and urgent, like business
notes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) wanted to see the long ones again, those of old times. In
order to find them at the bottom of the box, Rodolphe disturbed all the
others, and mechanically began rummaging amidst this mass of papers and
things, finding pell-mell bouquets, garters, a black mask, pins, and
hair--hair! dark and fair, some even, catching in the hinges of the box,
broke when it was opened.

<p/>Thus dallying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) souvenirs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) examined the writing and the style
of the letters, as varied as their orthography. They were tender or
jovial, facetious, melancholy; there were some that asked for love,
others that asked for money. A word recalled faces to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), certain
gestures, the sound of a voice; sometimes, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) remembered
nothing at all.

<p/>In fact, these women, rushing at once into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) thoughts, cramped each
other and lessened, as reduced to a uniform level of love that equalised
them all. So taking handfuls of the mixed-up letters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) amused himself
for some moments with letting them fall in cascades from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) right into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) left hand. At last, bored and weary, Rodolphe took back the box to
the cupboard, saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``What a lot of rubbish!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>Which summed
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) opinion; for pleasures, like schoolboys in a school courtyard,
had so trampled upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) heart that no green thing grew there, and that
which passed through it, more heedless than children, did not even, like
them, leave a name carved upon the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``let's begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) wrote--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, Emma! courage! I would not bring misery into your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After all, that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>thought Rodolphe. <div class="bookquote">``I am acting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
interest; I am honest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you carefully weighed your resolution? Do you know to what an
abyss I was dragging you, poor angel? No, you do not, do you? You were
coming confident and fearless, believing in happiness in the future. Ah!
unhappy that we are--insensate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div><p/>Rodolphe stopped here to think of some good excuse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) all my fortune is lost? No! Besides, that would stop
nothing. It would all have to be begun over again later on. As if one
could make women like that listen to reason!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) reflected, then went
on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not forget you, oh believe it; and I shall ever have a profound
devotion for you; but some day, sooner or later, this ardour -LRB-such is
the fate of human things-RRB- would have grown less, no doubt. Lassitude
would have come to us, and who knows if I should not even have had the
atrocious pain of witnessing your remorse, of sharing it myself, since
I should have been its cause? The mere idea of the grief that would come
to you tortures me, Emma. Forget me! Why did I ever know you? Why were
you so beautiful? Is it my fault? O my God! No, no! Accuse only fate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a word that always tells,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, if you had been one of those frivolous women that one sees,
certainly I might, through egotism, have tried an experiment, in that
case without danger for you. But that delicious exaltation, at once your
charm and your torment, has prevented you from understanding, adorable
woman that you are, the falseness of our future position. Nor had I
reflected upon this at first, and I rested in the shade of that ideal
happiness as beneath that of the manchineel tree, without foreseeing the
consequences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll think I'm giving it up from avarice. Ah, well! so much
the worse; it must be stopped!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The world is cruel, Emma. Wherever we might have gone, it would have
persecuted us. You would have had to put up with indiscreet questions,
calumny, contempt, insult perhaps. Insult to you! Oh! And I, who would
place you on a throne! I who bear with me your memory as a talisman! For
I am going to punish myself by exile for all the ill I have done you.
I am going away. Whither I know not. I am mad. Adieu! Be good always.
Preserve the memory of the unfortunate who has lost you. Teach my name
to your child; let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) repeat it in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) prayers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The wicks of the candles flickered. Rodolphe got up to, shut the window,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had sat down again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's all right. Ah! and this for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) should come and hunt
me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be far away when you read these sad lines, for I have wished to
flee as quickly as possible to shun the temptation of seeing you again.
No weakness! I shall return, and perhaps later on we shall talk together
very coldly of our old love. Adieu!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And there was a last <div class="bookquote">``adieu''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>divided into two words! <div class="bookquote">``A Dieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
thought in very excellent taste.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now how am I to sign?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said to himself. ```Yours devotedly?' No!
`Your friend?' Yes, that's it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) re-read his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) considered it very good.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought with emotion. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll think me harder
than a rock. There ought to have been some tears on this; but I can't
cry; it isn't my fault.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>Then, having emptied some water into a glass,
Rodolphe dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) finger into it, and let a big drop fall on the
paper, that made a pale stain on the ink. Then looking for a seal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
came upon the one <div class="bookquote">``Amor nel cor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't at all fit in with the circumstances. Pshaw! never mind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) smoked three pipes and went to bed.

<p/>The next day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was up -LRB-at about two o’clock--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had slept late-RRB-,
Rodolphe had a basket of apricots picked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) letter at
the bottom under some vine leaves, and at once ordered Girard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>)
ploughman, to take it with care to Madame Bovary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) made use of this
means for corresponding with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), sending according to the season fruits
or game.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asks after me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that I have gone on
a journey. You must give the basket to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself, into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own hands.
Get along and take care!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Girard put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) new blouse, knotted his (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) handkerchief round the
apricots, and walking with great heavy steps in his (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) thick iron-bound
galoshes, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) way to Yonville.

<p/>Madame Bovary, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) got to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) house, was arranging a bundle of linen
on the kitchen-table with Felicite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said the ploughboy, <div class="bookquote">``is something for you--from the master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was seized with apprehension, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) sought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) pocket for
some coppers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) looked at the peasant with haggard eyes, while he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>)
himself looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) with amazement, not understanding how such a
present could so move anyone. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) went out. Felicite remained.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) could bear it no longer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) ran into the sitting room as if to take
the apricots there, overturned the basket, tore away the leaves, found
the letter, opened it, and, as if some fearful fire were behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>),
Emma flew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room terrified.

<p/>Charles was there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard nothing, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on quickly up the stairs, breathless, distraught, dumb, and
ever holding this horrible piece of paper, that crackled between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
fingers like a plate of sheet-iron. On the second floor she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped
before the attic door, which was closed.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to calm herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recalled the letter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must finish
it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not dare to. And where? How? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would be seen! <div class="bookquote">``Ah, no!
here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma pushed open the door and went in.

<p/>The slates threw straight down a heavy heat that gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) temples,
stifled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dragged herself to the closed garret-window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drew
back the bolt, and the dazzling light burst in with a leap.

<p/>Opposite, beyond the roofs, stretched the open country till it was lost
to sight. Down below, underneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), the village square was empty; the
stones of the pavement glittered, the weathercocks on the houses were
motionless. At the corner of the street, from a lower storey, rose a
kind of humming with strident modulations. It was Binet turning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leant against the embrasure of the window, and reread the letter
with angry sneers. But the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention upon it, the
more confused were her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ideas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) again, heard him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), encircled
him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms, and throbs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, that beat against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breast
like blows of a sledge-hammer, grew faster and faster, with uneven
intervals. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with the wish that the earth might
crumble into pieces. Why not end it all? What restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
free. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) advanced, looking at the paving-stones, saying to herself,
<div class="bookquote">``Come! come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>The luminous ray that came straight up from below drew the weight of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) body towards the abyss. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that the ground of the
oscillating square went up the walls and that the floor dipped on
end like a tossing boat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was right at the edge, almost hanging,
surrounded by vast space. The blue of the heavens suffused her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), the air
was whirling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hollow head; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had but to yield, to let herself
be taken; and the humming of the lathe never ceased, like an angry voice
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma! Emma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>cried Charles.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wherever are you? Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had just escaped from death almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) faint
with terror. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shivered at the touch of a
hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sleeve; it was Felicite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master is waiting for you, madame; the soup is on the table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to go down to sit at table.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to eat. The food choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unfolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) napkin as
if to examine the darns, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) really thought of applying herself to
this work, counting the threads in the linen. Suddenly the remembrance
of the letter returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). How had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lost it? Where could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) find
it? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt such weariness of spirit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not even invent
a pretext for leaving the table. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) became a coward; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
afraid of Charles; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew all, that was certain! Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pronounced
these words in a strange manner:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not likely to see Monsieur Rodolphe soon again, it seems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, shuddering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) replied, rather astonished at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) abrupt tone. <div class="bookquote">``Why,
Girard, whom I met just now at the door of the Cafe Francais. He (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) has
gone on a journey, or is to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What surprises you in that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) absents himself like that from time
to time for a change, and, ma foi, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>)'s right, when one has a
fortune and is a bachelor. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>) has jolly times, has our friend.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Girard</b></font>)'s a bit of a rake. Monsieur Langlois told me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stopped for propriety's sake because the servant came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) put
back into the basket the apricots scattered on the sideboard. Charles,
without noticing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife's colour, had them brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), took one,
and bit into it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! perfect!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``just taste!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the basket, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do just smell! What an odour!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) remarked, passing it under her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nose
several times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am choking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cried, leaping up. But by an effort of will the
spasm passed; then--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is nothing! It is nervousness. Sit down
and go on eating.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dreaded lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should begin questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should not be left alone.

<p/>Charles, to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), sat down again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spat the stones of the
apricots into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands, afterwards putting them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) plate.

<p/>Suddenly a blue tilbury passed across the square at a rapid trot. Emma
uttered a cry and fell back rigid to the ground.

<p/>In fact, Rodolphe, after many reflections, had decided to set out for
Rouen. Now, as from La Huchette to Buchy there is no other way than by
Yonville, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had to go through the village, and Emma had recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>)
by the rays of the lanterns, which like lightning flashed through the
twilight.

<p/>The chemist, at the tumult which broke out in the house ran thither. The
table with all the plates was upset; sauce, meat, knives, the salt, and
cruet-stand were strewn over the room; Charles was calling for help;
Berthe, scared, was crying; and Felicite, whose hands trembled, was
unlacing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mistress, whose whole body shivered convulsively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll run to my laboratory for some aromatic vinegar,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>said the
druggist.

<p/>Then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes on smelling the bottle--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sure of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) remarked; <div class="bookquote">``that would wake any dead person for
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles; <div class="bookquote">``collect yourself; it is your Charles, who
loves you. Do you know me? See! here is your little girl! Oh, kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>The child stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother to cling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neck. But
turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, Emma said in a broken voice <div class="bookquote">``No, no! no one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fainted again. They carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lay there stretched
at full length, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips apart, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyelids closed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands open,
motionless, and white as a waxen image. Two streams of tears flowed from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes and fell slowly upon the pillow.

<p/>Charles, standing up, was at the back of the alcove, and the chemist,
near him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>), maintained that meditative silence that is becoming on the
serious occasions of life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be uneasy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) said, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) elbow; <div class="bookquote">``I think the paroxysm
is past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is resting a little now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>answered Charles, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
sleep. <div class="bookquote">``Poor girl! poor girl! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gone off now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Homais asked how the accident had come about. Charles answered that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been taken ill suddenly while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was eating some apricots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Extraordinary!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>continued the chemist. <div class="bookquote">``But it might be that the
apricots had brought on the syncope. Some natures are so sensitive to
certain smells; and it would even be a very fine question to study both
in its pathological and physiological relation. The priests know the
importance of it, they who have introduced aromatics into all their
ceremonies. It is to stupefy the senses and to bring on ecstasies--a
thing, moreover, very easy in persons of the weaker sex, who are more
delicate than the other. Some are cited who faint at the smell of burnt
hartshorn, of new bread--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care; you'll wake her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And not only,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>the druggist went on, <div class="bookquote">``are human beings subject to such
anomalies, but animals also. Thus you are not ignorant of the singularly
aphrodisiac effect produced by the Nepeta cataria, vulgarly called
catmint, on the feline race; and, on the other hand, to quote an example
whose authenticity I can answer for. Bridaux -LRB-one of my old comrades, at
present established in the Rue Malpalu-RRB- possesses a dog that falls into
convulsions as soon as you hold out a snuff-box to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) often even
makes the experiment before his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) friends at his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) summer-house at Guillaume
Wood. Would anyone believe that a simple sternutation could produce such
ravages on a quadrupedal organism? It is extremely curious, is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles, who was not listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This shows us,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went on the other, smiling with benign
self-sufficiency, <div class="bookquote">``the innumerable irregularities of the nervous system.
With regard to madame, she (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) has always seemed to me, I confess, very
susceptible. And so I should by no means recommend to you, my dear
friend, any of those so-called remedies that, under the pretence
of attacking the symptoms, attack the constitution. No; no useless
physicking! Diet, that is all; sedatives, emollients, dulcification.
Then, don't you think that perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) imagination should be worked
upon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way? How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that is it. Such is indeed the question. `That is the question,' as
I lately read in a newspaper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>But Emma, awaking, cried out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The letter! the letter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>They thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was delirious; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was by midnight. Brain-fever had
set in.

<p/>For forty-three days Charles did not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gave up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
patients; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) no longer went to bed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was constantly feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pulse,
putting on sinapisms and cold-water compresses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent Justin as far as
Neufchatel for ice; the ice melted on the way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) called Monsieur Canivet into consultation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent for Dr. Lariviere,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) old master, from Rouen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was in despair. What alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) most was
Emma's prostration, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not speak, did not listen, did not even
seem to suffer, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) body and soul were both resting together after
all their troubles.

<p/>About the middle of October she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could sit up in bed supported by
pillows. Charles wept when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first bread-and-jelly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
strength returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) got up for a few hours of an afternoon,
and one day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tried to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
arm, for a walk round the garden. The sand of the paths was disappearing
beneath the dead leaves; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked slowly, dragging along her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) slippers,
and leaning against Charles's shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) smiled all the time.

<p/>They went thus to the bottom of the garden near the terrace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drew
herself up slowly, shading her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand to look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked
far off, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, but on the horizon were only great
bonfires of grass smoking on the hills.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will tire yourself, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary. And, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
gently to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) go into the arbour, <div class="bookquote">``Sit down on this seat; you'll be
comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no; not there!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said in a faltering voice.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was seized with giddiness, and from that evening her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) illness
recommenced, with a more uncertain character, it is true, and more
complex symptoms. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suffered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, then in the chest, the
head, the limbs; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had vomitings, in which Charles thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw the
first signs of cancer.

<p/>And besides this, the poor fellow was worried about money matters.



<p/>Chapter Fourteen

<p/>To begin with, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not know how he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could pay Monsieur Homais for all
the physic supplied by him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and though, as a medical man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
obliged to pay for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nevertheless blushed a little at such an
obligation. Then the expenses of the household, now that the servant was
mistress, became terrible. Bills rained in upon the house; the tradesmen
grumbled; Monsieur Lheureux especially harassed him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). In fact, at
the height of Emma's illness, the latter, taking advantage of the
circumstances to make his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) bill larger, had hurriedly brought the cloak,
the travelling-bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other
things. It was very well for Charles to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not want them. The
tradesman answered arrogantly that these articles had been ordered, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) would not take them back; besides, it would vex madame in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
convalescence; the doctor had better think it over; in short, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was
resolved to sue him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) rather than give up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) rights and take back his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
goods. Charles subsequently ordered them to be sent back to the shop.
Felicite forgot; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had other things to attend to; then thought no more
about them. Monsieur Lheureux returned to the charge, and, by turns
threatening and whining, so managed that Bovary ended by signing a
bill at six months. But hardly had he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) signed this bill than a bold idea
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>): it was to borrow a thousand francs from Lheureux.
So, with an embarrassed air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked if it were possible to get them,
adding that it would be for a year, at any interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wished. Lheureux
ran off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shop, brought back the money, and dictated another bill,
by which Bovary undertook to pay to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) order on the 1st of September
next the sum of one thousand and seventy francs, which, with the hundred
and eighty already agreed to, made just twelve hundred and fifty, thus
lending at six per cent in addition to one-fourth for commission: and
the things bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in a good third at the least, this ought in
twelve months to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a profit of a hundred and thirty francs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
hoped that the business would not stop there; that the bills would not
be paid; that they would be renewed; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) poor little money,
having thriven at the doctor's as at a hospital, would come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
one day considerably more plump, and fat enough to burst his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bag.

<p/>Everything, moreover, succeeded with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was adjudicator for a
supply of cider to the hospital at Neufchatel; Monsieur Guillaumin
promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) some shares in the turf-pits of Gaumesnil, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dreamt of
establishing a new diligence service between Arcueil and Rouen, which
no doubt would not be long in ruining the ramshackle van of the <div class="bookquote">``Lion
d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and that, travelling faster, at a cheaper rate, and carrying more
luggage, would thus put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands the whole commerce of Yonville.

<p/>Charles several times asked himself by what means he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should next year be
able to pay back so much money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reflected, imagined expedients, such
as applying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father or selling something. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father would be
deaf, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had nothing to sell. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) foresaw such worries that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) quickly dismissed so disagreeable a subject of meditation from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reproached himself with forgetting Emma, as if, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
thoughts belonging to this woman, it was robbing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of something not to
be constantly thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>The winter was severe, Madame Bovary's convalescence slow. When it
was fine they wheeled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm-chair to the window that overlooked the
square, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now had an antipathy to the garden, and the blinds on
that side were always down. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished the horse to be sold; what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
formerly liked now displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). All her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ideas seemed to be limited to
the care of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stayed in bed taking little meals, rang for the
servant to inquire about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gruel or to chat with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The snow on
the market-roof threw a white, still light into the room; then the rain
began to fall; and Emma waited daily with a mind full of eagerness for
the inevitable return of some trifling events which nevertheless had no
relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The most important was the arrival of the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in the evening. Then the landlady shouted out, and other voices
answered, while Hippolyte's lantern, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) fetched the boxes from the
boot, was like a star in the darkness. At mid-day Charles came in;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went out again; next she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) took some beef-tea, and towards five
o’clock, as the day drew in, the children coming back from school,
dragging their wooden shoes along the pavement, knocked the clapper of
the shutters with their rulers one after the other.

<p/>It was at this hour that Monsieur Bournisien came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
inquired after her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) health, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) news, exhorted her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to religion, in a
coaxing little prattle that was not without its charm. The mere thought
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cassock comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).

<p/>One day, when at the height of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) illness, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had thought herself
dying, and had asked for the communion; and, while they were making the
preparations in her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) room for the sacrament, while they were turning the
night table covered with syrups into an altar, and while Felicite was
strewing dahlia flowers on the floor, Emma felt some power passing
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that freed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pains, from all perception, from
all feeling. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) body, relieved, no longer thought; another life was
beginning; it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being, mounting toward God, would
be annihilated in that love like a burning incense that melts into
vapour. The bed-clothes were sprinkled with holy water, the priest drew
from the holy pyx the white wafer; and it was fainting with a celestial
joy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips to accept the body of the Saviour
presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The curtains of the alcove floated gently round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
like clouds, and the rays of the two tapers burning on the night-table
seemed to shine like dazzling halos. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head fall back,
fancying she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard in space the music of seraphic harps, and perceived
in an azure sky, on a golden throne in the midst of saints holding green
palms, God the Father, resplendent with majesty, who with a sign sent to
earth angels with wings of fire to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) away in their arms.

<p/>This splendid vision dwelt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) memory as the most beautiful thing
that it was possible to dream, so that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) strove to recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
sensation. That still lasted, however, but in a less exclusive fashion
and with a deeper sweetness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul, tortured by pride, at length
found rest in Christian humility, and, tasting the joy of weakness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
saw within herself the destruction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will, that must have left a
wide entrance for the inroads of heavenly grace. There existed, then,
in the place of happiness, still greater joys--another love beyond all
loves, without pause and without end, one that would grow eternally! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
saw amid the illusions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hope a state of purity floating above the
earth mingling with heaven, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aspired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to become
a saint. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bought chaplets and wore amulets; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished to have in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
room, by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bed, a reliquary set in emeralds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might
kiss it every evening.

<p/>The cure marvelled at this humour, although Emma's religion, he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) thought,
might, from its fervour, end by touching on heresy, extravagance. But
not being much versed in these matters, as soon as they went beyond a
certain limit he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) wrote to Monsieur Boulard, bookseller to Monsignor,
to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``something good for a lady who was very clever.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The
bookseller, with as much indifference as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) had been sending off
hardware to niggers, packed up, pellmell, everything that was then the
fashion in the pious book trade. There were little manuals in questions
and answers, pamphlets of aggressive tone after the manner of Monsieur
de Maistre, and certain novels in rose-coloured bindings and with
a honied style, manufactured by troubadour seminarists or penitent
blue-stockings. There were the <div class="bookquote">``Think of it; the Man of the World at
Mary's Feet, by Monsieur de ***, decorated with many Orders'' (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>; <div class="bookquote">``The
Errors of Voltaire, for the Use of the Young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>etc..

<p/>Madame Bovary's mind was not yet sufficiently clear to apply herself
seriously to anything; moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) began this reading in too much
hurry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) grew provoked at the doctrines of religion; the arrogance
of the polemic writings displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) by their inveteracy in attacking
people she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) did not know; and the secular stories, relieved with
religion, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) written in such ignorance of the world, that
they insensibly estranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) from the truths for whose proof she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) was
looking. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) persevered; and when the volume slipped
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) fancied herself seized with the finest Catholic
melancholy that an ethereal soul could conceive.

<p/>As for the memory of Rodolphe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) had thrust it back to the bottom of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) heart, and it remained there more solemn and more motionless than
a king's mummy in a catacomb. An exhalation escaped from this embalmed
love, that, penetrating through everything, perfumed with tenderness the
immaculate atmosphere in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) longed to live. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) knelt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>)
Gothic prie-Dieu, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) addressed to the Lord the same suave words that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) had murmured formerly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) lover in the outpourings of adultery.
It was to make faith come; but no delights descended from the heavens,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) arose with tired limbs and with a vague feeling of a gigantic
dupery.

<p/>This searching after faith, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) thought, was only one merit the more,
and in the pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) devoutness Emma compared herself to those grand
ladies of long ago whose glory she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had dreamed of over a portrait of La
Valliere, and who, trailing with so much majesty the lace-trimmed trains
of their long gowns, retired into solitudes to shed at the feet of
Christ all the tears of hearts that life had wounded.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) gave herself up to excessive charity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) sewed clothes for the
poor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) sent wood to women in childbed; and Charles one day, on coming
home, found three good-for-nothings in the kitchen seated at the table
eating soup. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) little girl, whom during her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) illness her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>)
husband had sent back to the nurse, brought home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) wanted to teach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) to read; even when Berthe cried, she (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) was not vexed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) had made
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) mind to resignation, to universal indulgence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) language about
everything was full of ideal expressions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) child, <div class="bookquote">``Is
your stomach-ache better, my angel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Bovary senior found nothing to censure except perhaps this mania
of knitting jackets for orphans instead of mending her (<font color='blue'><b>Valliere</b></font>) own house-linen;
but, harassed with domestic quarrels, the good woman took pleasure in
this quiet house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) even stayed there till after Easter, to escape
the sarcasms of old Bovary, who never failed on Good Friday to order
chitterlings.

<p/>Besides the companionship of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother-in-law, who strengthened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a
little by the rectitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) judgment and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grave ways, Emma almost
every day had other visitors. These were Madame Langlois, Madame Caron,
Madame Dubreuil, Madame Tuvache, and regularly from two to five o’clock
the excellent Madame Homais, who, for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) part, had never believed any
of the tittle-tattle about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbour. The little Homais also came to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); Justin accompanied them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) went up with them to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bedroom,
and remained standing near the door, motionless and mute. Often even
Madame Bovary; taking no heed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>), began her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) toilette. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began by
taking out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comb, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head with a quick movement, and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) for the first time saw all this mass of hair that fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees
unrolling in black ringlets, it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>), poor child! like a sudden
entrance into something new and strange, whose splendour terrified him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>).

<p/>Emma, no doubt, did not notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) silent attentions or his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) timidity.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no suspicion that the love vanished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life was there,
palpitating by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side, beneath that coarse holland shirt, in that
youthful heart open to the emanations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) beauty. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
now enveloped all things with such indifference, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had words so
affectionate with looks so haughty, such contradictory ways, that one
could no longer distinguish egotism from charity, or corruption from
virtue. One evening, for example, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was angry with the servant, who
had asked to go out, and stammered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to find some pretext.
Then suddenly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you love him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/>And without waiting for any answer from Felicite, who was blushing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``There! run along; enjoy yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In the beginning of spring she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the garden turned up from end to end,
despite Bovary's remonstrances. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at last
manifest a wish of any kind. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grew stronger she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) displayed more
wilfulness. First, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found occasion to expel Mere Rollet, the nurse,
who during her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convalescence had contracted the habit of coming too
often to the kitchen with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) two nurslings and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) boarder, better
off for teeth than a cannibal. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) got rid of the Homais family,
successively dismissed all the other visitors, and even frequented
church less assiduously, to the great approval of the druggist, who said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in a friendly way--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were going in a bit for the cassock!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>As formerly, Monsieur Bournisien dropped in every day when he (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) came out
after catechism class. He (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) preferred staying out of doors to taking the
air <div class="bookquote">``in the grove,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) called the arbour. This was the time when
Charles came home. They were hot; some sweet cider was brought out, and
they drank together to madame's complete restoration.

<p/>Binet was there; that is to say, a little lower down against the terrace
wall, fishing for crayfish. Bovary invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to have a drink, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
thoroughly understood the uncorking of the stone bottles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, throwing a satisfied glance all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), even to
the very extremity of the landscape, <div class="bookquote">``hold the bottle perpendicularly on
the table, and after the strings are cut, press up the cork with
little thrusts, gently, gently, as indeed they do seltzer-water at
restaurants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But during his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) demonstration the cider often spurted right into their
faces, and then the ecclesiastic, with a thick laugh, never missed this
joke--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Its goodness strikes the eye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was, in fact, a good fellow and one day he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was not even scandalised
at the chemist, who advised Charles to give madame some distraction
by taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to the theatre at Rouen to hear the illustrious tenor,
Lagardy. Homais, surprised at this silence, wanted to know his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) opinion,
and the priest declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) considered music less dangerous for
morals than literature.

<p/>But the chemist took up the defence of letters. The theatre, he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)
contended, served for railing at prejudices, and, beneath a mask of
pleasure, taught virtue.

<p/>```Castigat ridendo mores,' * Monsieur Bournisien! Thus consider the
greater part of Voltaire's tragedies; they are cleverly strewn with
philosophical reflections, that made them a vast school of morals and
diplomacy for the people.''

<p/>*It corrects customs through laughter.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Binet/Monsieur Binet</b></font>)</div>said Binet, <div class="bookquote">``once saw a piece called the `Gamin de Paris,' in which
there was the character of an old general that is really hit off to a
T. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sets down a young swell who had seduced a working girl, who at the
ending--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Binet/Monsieur Binet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>continued Homais, <div class="bookquote">``there is bad literature as there is bad
pharmacy, but to condemn in a lump the most important of the fine arts
seems to me a stupidity, a Gothic idea, worthy of the abominable times
that imprisoned Galileo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>objected the cure, <div class="bookquote">``that there are good works,
good authors. However, if it were only those persons of different sexes
united in a bewitching apartment, decorated rouge, those lights, those
effeminate voices, all this must, in the long-run, engender a
certain mental libertinage, give rise to immodest thoughts and impure
temptations. Such, at any rate, is the opinion of all the Fathers.
Finally,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) added, suddenly assuming a mystic tone of voice while
he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) rolled a pinch of snuff between his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``if the Church has
condemned the theatre, she (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) must be right; we must submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>)
decrees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>asked the druggist, <div class="bookquote">``should she (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) excommunicate actors? For
formerly they openly took part in religious ceremonies. Yes, in the
middle of the chancel they acted; they performed a kind of farce called
`Mysteries,' which often offended against the laws of decency.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>The ecclesiastic contented himself with uttering a groan, and the
chemist went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like it is in the Bible; there there are, you know, more than one
piquant detail, matters really libidinous!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>And on a gesture of irritation from Monsieur Bournisien--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you'll admit that it is not a book to place in the hands of a young
girl, and I should be sorry if Athalie--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Bournisien/Bournisien</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is the Protestants, and not we,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the other impatiently,
<div class="bookquote">``who recommend the Bible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said Homais. <div class="bookquote">``I am surprised that in our days, in this
century of enlightenment, anyone should still persist in proscribing an
intellectual relaxation that is inoffensive, moralising, and sometimes
even hygienic; is it not, doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor carelessly, either because, sharing the
same ideas, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wished to offend no one, or else because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had not any
ideas.

<p/>The conversation seemed at an end when the chemist thought fit to shoot
a Parthian arrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've known priests who put on ordinary clothes to go and see dancers
kicking about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the cure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I've known some!''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>And separating the words of his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) sentence, Homais
repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I--have--known--some!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they were wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Bournisien/Bournisien</b></font>)</div>said Bournisien, resigned to anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove! they go in for more than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the druggist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>replied the ecclesiastic, with such angry eyes that the druggist
was intimidated by them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only mean to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) replied in less brutal a tone, <div class="bookquote">``that toleration
is the surest way to draw people to religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true! that is true!''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>agreed the good fellow, sitting down again
on his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) chair. But he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) stayed only a few moments.

<p/>Then, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) had gone, Monsieur Homais said to the doctor--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I call a cock-fight. I beat him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), did you see, in a
way!--Now take my advice. Take madame to the theatre, if it were only
for once in your life, to enrage one of these ravens, hang it! If anyone
could take my place, I would accompany you myself. Be quick about it.
Lagardy is only going to give one performance; he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s engaged to go to
England at a high salary. From what I hear, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s a regular dog; he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s
rolling in money; he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s taking three mistresses and a cook along with
him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). All these great artists burn the candle at both ends; they require
a dissolute life, that suits the imagination to some extent. But they
die at the hospital, because they haven't the sense when young to lay
by. Well, a pleasant dinner! Goodbye till to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea of the theatre quickly germinated in Bovary's head, for he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) at
once communicated it to his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) wife, who at first refused, alleging the
fatigue, the worry, the expense; but, for a wonder, Charles did not give
in, so sure was he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) that this recreation would be good for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw
nothing to prevent it: his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother had sent them three hundred francs
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had no longer expected; the current debts were not very large,
and the falling in of Lheureux's bills was still so far off that
there was no need to think about them. Besides, imagining that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was refusing from delicacy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) insisted the more; so that by dint of
worrying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at last made up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind, and the next day at eight
o’clock they set out in the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The druggist, whom nothing whatever kept at Yonville, but who thought
himself bound not to budge from it, sighed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw them go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, a pleasant journey!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said to them; <div class="bookquote">``happy mortals that you
are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then addressing himself to Emma, who was wearing a blue silk gown with
four flounces--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are as lovely as a Venus. You'll cut a figure at Rouen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>The diligence stopped at the <div class="bookquote">``Croix-Rouge''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in the Place Beauvoisine. It
was the inn that is in every provincial faubourg, with large stables
and small bedrooms, where one sees in the middle of the court chickens
pilfering the oats under the muddy gigs of the commercial travellers--a
good old house, with worm-eaten balconies that creak in the wind on
winter nights, always full of people, noise, and feeding, whose black
tables are sticky with coffee and brandy, the thick windows made yellow
by the flies, the damp napkins stained with cheap wine, and that always
smells of the village, like ploughboys dressed in Sundayclothes, has
a cafe on the street, and towards the countryside a kitchen-garden.
Charles at once set out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) muddled up the stage-boxes with the gallery,
the pit with the boxes; asked for explanations, did not understand them;
was sent from the box-office to the acting-manager; came back to the
inn, returned to the theatre, and thus several times traversed the whole
length of the town from the theatre to the boulevard.

<p/>Madame Bovary bought a bonnet, gloves, and a bouquet. The doctor was
much afraid of missing the beginning, and, without having had time to
swallow a plate of soup, they presented themselves at the doors of the
theatre, which were still closed.




<p/>Chapter Fifteen

<p/>The crowd was waiting against the wall, symmetrically enclosed between
the balustrades. At the corner of the neighbouring streets huge bills
repeated in quaint letters <div class="bookquote">``Lucie de Lammermoor-Lagardy-Opera-etc.''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>The
weather was fine, the people were hot, perspiration trickled amid the
curls, and handkerchiefs taken from pockets were mopping red foreheads;
and now and then a warm wind that blew from the river gently stirred the
border of the tick awnings hanging from the doors of the public-houses.
A little lower down, however, one was refreshed by a current of icy air
that smelt of tallow, leather, and oil. This was an exhalation from
the Rue des Charrettes, full of large black warehouses where they made
casks.

<p/>For fear of seeming ridiculous, Emma before going in wished to have a
little stroll in the harbour, and Bovary prudently kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) tickets in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) hand, in the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) trousers, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>) pressed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Bovary</b></font>)
stomach.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart began to beat as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reached the vestibule. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
involuntarily smiled with vanity on seeing the crowd rushing to the
right by the other corridor while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went up the staircase to the
reserved seats. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was as pleased as a child to push with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) finger
the large tapestried door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breathed in with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might the
dusty smell of the lobbies, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) box she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bent
forward with the air of a duchess.

<p/>The theatre was beginning to fill; opera-glasses were taken from their
cases, and the subscribers, catching sight of one another, were bowing.
They came to seek relaxation in the fine arts after the anxieties of
business; but <div class="bookquote">``business''  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>was not forgotten; they still talked cottons,
spirits of wine, or indigo. The heads of old men were to be seen,
inexpressive and peaceful, with their hair and complexions looking like
silver medals tarnished by steam of lead. The young beaux were strutting
about in the pit, showing in the opening of their waistcoats their pink
or applegreen cravats, and Madame Bovary from above admired them leaning
on their canes with golden knobs in the open palm of their yellow
gloves.

<p/>Now the lights of the orchestra were lit, the lustre, let down from the
ceiling, throwing by the glimmering of its facets a sudden gaiety over
the theatre; then the musicians came in one after the other; and
first there was the protracted hubbub of the basses grumbling, violins
squeaking, cornets trumpeting, flutes and flageolets fifing. But three
knocks were heard on the stage, a rolling of drums began, the brass
instruments played some chords, and the curtain rising, discovered a
country-scene.

<p/>It was the cross-roads of a wood, with a fountain shaded by an oak to
the left. Peasants and lords with plaids on their shoulders were singing
a hunting-song together; then a captain suddenly came on, who evoked
the spirit of evil by lifting both his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) arms to heaven. Another appeared;
they went away, and the hunters started afresh. She (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) felt herself
transported to the reading of her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) youth, into the midst of Walter Scott.
She (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) seemed to hear through the mist the sound of the Scotch bagpipes
re-echoing over the heather. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) remembrance of the novel helping
her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to understand the libretto, she (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) followed the story phrase by phrase,
while vague thoughts that came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) dispersed at once again with
the bursts of music. She (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) gave herself up to the lullaby of the melodies,
and felt all her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) being vibrate as if the violin bows were drawn over her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
nerves. She (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had not eyes enough to look at the costumes, the scenery,
the actors, the painted trees that shook when anyone walked, and the
velvet caps, cloaks, swords--all those imaginary things that floated
amid the harmony as in the atmosphere of another world. But a young
woman stepped forward, throwing a purse to a squire in green. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
left alone, and the flute was heard like the murmur of a fountain or the
warbling of birds. Lucie attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cavatina in G major bravely. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
plained of love; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) longed for wings. Emma, too, fleeing from life,
would have liked to fly away in an embrace. Suddenly Edgar-Lagardy
appeared.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had that splendid pallor that gives something of the majesty of
marble to the ardent races of the South. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) vigorous form was tightly
clad in a brown-coloured doublet; a small chiselled poniard hung against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) left thigh, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) cast round laughing looks showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) white
teeth. They said that a Polish princess having heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) sing one night
on the beach at Biarritz, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) mended boats, had fallen in love
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had ruined herself for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) for
other women, and this sentimental celebrity did not fail to enhance his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>)
artistic reputation. The diplomatic mummer took care always to slip into
his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) advertisements some poetic phrase on the fascination of his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>)
person and the susceptibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) soul. A fine organ, imperturbable
coolness, more temperament than intelligence, more power of emphasis
than of real singing, made up the charm of this admirable charlatan
nature, in which there was something of the hairdresser and the
toreador.

<p/>From the first scene he (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) evoked enthusiasm. He (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) pressed Lucy in his (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) arms,
he (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) came back, he (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) seemed desperate; he (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) had outbursts of
rage, then elegiac gurglings of infinite sweetness, and the notes
escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) bare neck full of sobs and kisses. Emma leant forward
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>), clutching the velvet of the box with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nails. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
filling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart with these melodious lamentations that were drawn
out to the accompaniment of the double-basses, like the cries of the
drowning in the tumult of a tempest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recognised all the intoxication
and the anguish that had almost killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The voice of a prima donna
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be but echoes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) conscience, and this illusion that
charmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as some very thing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own life. But no one on earth had
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with such love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not wept like Edgar that last moonlit
night when they said, <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow! to-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edgar</b></font>)</div>The theatre rang with
cheers; they recommenced the entire movement; the lovers spoke of
the flowers on their tomb, of vows, exile, fate, hopes; and when they
uttered the final adieu, Emma gave a sharp cry that mingled with the
vibrations of the last chords.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>asked Bovary, <div class="bookquote">``does that gentleman persecute her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) lover!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) vows vengeance on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) family, while the other one who came on
before said, `I love Lucie and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) loves me!' Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) went off with
her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) father arm in arm. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) certainly is her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) father, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--the
ugly little man with a cock's feather in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Despite Emma's explanations, as soon as the recitative duet began
in which Gilbert lays bare his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) abominable machinations to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) master
Ashton, Charles, seeing the false troth-ring that is to deceive Lucie,
thought it was a love-gift sent by Edgar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) confessed, moreover, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) did not understand the story because of the music, which interfered
very much with the words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``Do be quiet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) went on, leaning against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``I like
to understand things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet! be quiet!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried impatiently.

<p/>Lucie advanced, half supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) women, a wreath of orange blossoms
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair, and paler than the white satin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gown. Emma dreamed
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) marriage day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw herself at home again amid the corn in the
little path as they walked to the church. Oh, why had not she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), like
this woman, resisted, implored? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), on the contrary, had been joyous,
without seeing the abyss into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was throwing herself. Ah! if
in the freshness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) beauty, before the soiling of marriage and the
disillusions of adultery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have anchored her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life upon some
great, strong heart, then virtue, tenderness, voluptuousness, and duty
blending, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would never have fallen from so high a happiness. But that
happiness, no doubt, was a lie invented for the despair of all desire.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) now knew the smallness of the passions that art exaggerated. So,
striving to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, Emma determined now to see in this
reproduction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sorrows only a plastic fantasy, well enough to
please the eye, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even smiled internally with disdainful pity when
at the back of the stage under the velvet hangings a man appeared in a
black cloak.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) large Spanish hat fell at a gesture he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made, and immediately the
instruments and the singers began the sextet. Edgar, flashing with fury,
dominated all the others with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) clearer voice; Ashton hurled homicidal
provocations at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) in deep notes; Lucie uttered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shrill plaint,
Arthur at one side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) modulated tones in the middle register, and the
bass of the minister pealed forth like an organ, while the voices of the
women repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) words took them up in chorus delightfully. They were
all in a row gesticulating, and anger, vengeance, jealousy, terror, and
stupefaction breathed forth at once from their half-opened mouths. The
outraged lover brandished his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) naked sword; his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) guipure ruffle rose with
jerks to the movements of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) chest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) walked from right to left
with long strides, clanking against the boards the silver-gilt spurs of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) soft boots, widening out at the ankles. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) thought must have an
inexhaustible love to lavish it upon the crowd with such effusion.
All her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) small fault-findings faded before the poetry of the part
that absorbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>); and, drawn towards this man by the illusion of the
character, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) tried to imagine to herself his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) life--that life resonant,
extraordinary, splendid, and that might have been hers if fate had
willed it. They would have known one another, loved one another. With
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), through all the kingdoms of Europe she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would have travelled from
capital to capital, sharing his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) fatigues and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) pride, picking up the
flowers thrown to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), herself embroidering his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) costumes. Then each
evening, at the back of a box, behind the golden trellis-work she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would
have drunk in eagerly the expansions of this soul that would have sung
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) alone; from the stage, even as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) acted, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would have looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). But the mad idea seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>); it was
certain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) longed to run to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) arms, to take refuge in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) strength,
as in the incarnation of love itself, and to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), to cry out,
<div class="bookquote">``Take me away! carry me with you! let us go! Thine, thine! all my ardour
and all my dreams!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The curtain fell.

<p/>The smell of the gas mingled with that of the breaths, the waving of the
fans, made the air more suffocating. Emma wanted to go out; the
crowd filled the corridors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm-chair with
palpitations that choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Charles, fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would faint, ran
to the refreshment-room to get a glass of barley-water.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had great difficulty in getting back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) seat, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) elbows were
jerked at every step because of the glass he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) even spilt three-fourths on the shoulders of a Rouen lady in short
sleeves, who feeling the cold liquid running down to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loins, uttered
cries like a peacock, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were being assassinated. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband,
who was a millowner, railed at the clumsy fellow, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handkerchief wiping up the stains from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handsome cherry-coloured
taffeta gown, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) angrily muttered about indemnity, costs, reimbursement.
At last Charles reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife, saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), quite out of breath--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ma foi! I thought I should have had to stay there. There is such a
crowd--SUCH a crowd!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) added--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just guess whom I met up there! Monsieur Leon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Himself! He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)'s coming along to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) respects.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) finished
these words the ex-clerk of Yonville entered the box.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand with the ease of a gentleman; and Madame Bovary
extended hers, without doubt obeying the attraction of a stronger will.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not felt it since that spring evening when the rain fell upon
the green leaves, and they had said good-bye standing at the window.
But soon recalling herself to the necessities of the situation, with an
effort she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shook off the torpor of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) memories, and began stammering a
few hurried words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, good-day! What! you here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from the pit, for the third act was beginning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are at Rouen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And since when?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn them out! turn them out!''  (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>People were looking at them. They were
silent.

<p/>But from that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) listened no more; and the chorus of the guests,
the scene between Ashton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) servant, the grand duet in D major, all
were for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as far off as if the instruments had grown less sonorous
and the characters more remote. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remembered the games at cards at the
druggist's, and the walk to the nurse's, the reading in the arbour,
the tete-a-tete by the fireside--all that poor love, so calm and so
protracted, so discreet, so tender, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had nevertheless
forgotten. And why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) come back? What combination of circumstances
had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) back into her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) life? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) was standing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), leaning
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) shoulder against the wall of the box; now and again she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) felt
herself shuddering beneath the hot breath from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) nostrils falling upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does this amuse you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>), bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) so closely that the end
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) moustache brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) replied carelessly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me, no, not much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) proposed that they should leave the theatre and go and take an
ice somewhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not yet; let us stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hair's undone; this is
going to be tragic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>But the mad scene did not at all interest Emma, and the acting of the
singer seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) exaggerated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) screams too loud,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), turning to Charles, who was listening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) replied, undecided between the frankness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
pleasure and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife's opinion.

<p/>Then with a sigh Leon said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The heat is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unbearable! Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel unwell?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Bovary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am stifling; let us go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur Leon put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) long lace shawl carefully about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shoulders, and
all three went off to sit down in the harbour, in the open air, outside
the windows of a cafe.

<p/>First they spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) illness, although Emma interrupted Charles
from time to time, for fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, of boring Monsieur Leon; and the
latter told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had come to spend two years at Rouen in a large
office, in order to get practice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) profession, which was different
in Normandy and Paris. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) inquired after Berthe, the Homais, Mere
Lefrancois, and as they had, in the husband's presence, nothing more to
say to one another, the conversation soon came to an end.

<p/>People coming out of the theatre passed along the pavement, humming or
shouting at the top of their voices, <div class="bookquote">``O bel ange, ma Lucie!*''  (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>Then Leon,
playing the dilettante, began to talk music. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had seen Tambourini,
Rubini, Persiani, Grisi, and, compared with them, Lagardy, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
grand outbursts, was nowhere.

<p/>*Oh beautiful angel, my Lucie.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>interrupted Charles, who was slowly sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) rum-sherbet,
<div class="bookquote">``they say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) is quite admirable in the last act. I regret leaving
before the end, because it was beginning to amuse me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) will soon give another performance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>But Charles replied that they were going back next day. <div class="bookquote">``Unless,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
added, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``you would like to stay alone, kitten?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>And changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tactics at this unexpected opportunity that presented
itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hopes, the young man sang the praises of Lagardy in the
last number. It was really superb, sublime. Then Charles insisted--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would get back on Sunday. Come, make up your mind. You are wrong if
you feel that this is doing you the least good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>The tables round them, however, were emptying; a waiter came and stood
discreetly near them. Charles, who understood, took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) purse; the
clerk held back his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arm, and did not forget to leave two more pieces of
silver that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made chink on the marble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am really sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary, <div class="bookquote">``about the money which you are--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/>The other made a careless gesture full of cordiality, and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hat
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is settled, isn't it? To-morrow at six o’clock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles explained once more that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not absent himself longer, but
that nothing prevented Emma--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stammered, with a strange smile, <div class="bookquote">``I am not sure--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you must think it over. We'll see. Night brings counsel.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then to
Leon, who was walking along with them, <div class="bookquote">``Now that you are in our part of
the world, I hope you'll come and ask us for some dinner now and then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div><p/>The clerk declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) would not fail to do so, being obliged, moreover,
to go to Yonville on some business for his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) office. And they parted
before the Saint-Herbland Passage just as the clock in the cathedral
struck half-past eleven.




<p/>Part III



<p/>Chapter One

<p/>Monsieur Leon, while studying law, had gone pretty often to the
dancing-rooms, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was even a great success amongst the grisettes,
who thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had a distinguished air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was the best-mannered of the
students; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hair neither too long nor too short, didn't spend
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) quarter's money on the first day of the month, and kept on good
terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) professors. As for excesses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had always abstained from
them, as much from cowardice as from refinement.

<p/>Often when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) stayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) room to read, or else when sitting of an
evening under the lime-trees of the Luxembourg, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) Code fall to
the ground, and the memory of Emma came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>). But gradually this
feeling grew weaker, and other desires gathered over it, although it
still persisted through them all. For Leon did not lose all hope; there
was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), as it were, a vague promise floating in the future, like a
golden fruit suspended from some fantastic tree.

<p/>Then, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) again after three years of absence his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) passion
reawakened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) must, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) thought, at last make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mind to possess
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) timidity had worn off by contact with his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) gay
companions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) returned to the provinces despising everyone who had
not with varnished shoes trodden the asphalt of the boulevards. By
the side of a Parisienne in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) laces, in the drawing-room of some
illustrious physician, a person driving his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) carriage and wearing many
orders, the poor clerk would no doubt have trembled like a child; but
here, at Rouen, on the harbour, with the wife of this small doctor
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) felt at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ease, sure beforehand he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would shine. Self-possession
depends on its environment. We don't speak on the first floor as on the
fourth; and the wealthy woman seems to have, about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to guard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
virtue, all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) banknotes, like a cuirass in the lining of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) corset.

<p/>On leaving the Bovarys the night before, Leon had followed them
through the streets at a distance; then having seen them stop at the
<div class="bookquote">``Croix-Rouge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) heel, and spent the night meditating a
plan.

<p/>So the next day about five o’clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) walked into the kitchen of the
inn, with a choking sensation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) throat, pale cheeks, and that
resolution of cowards that stops at nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The gentleman isn't in,''  (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div>answered a servant.

<p/>This seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) a good omen. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went upstairs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not disturbed at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) approach; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) apologised
for having neglected to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) where they were staying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I divined it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) pretended he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had been guided towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by chance, by, instinct. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
began to smile; and at once, to repair his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) folly, Leon told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) morning in looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in all the hotels in the town
one after the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you have made up your mind to stay?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I am wrong. One ought not to accustom oneself to
impossible pleasures when there are a thousand demands upon one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can imagine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! no; for you, you are a man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>But men too had had their trials, and the conversation went off into
certain philosophical reflections. Emma expatiated much on the misery of
earthly affections, and the eternal isolation in which the heart remains
entombed.

<p/>To show off, or from a naive imitation of this melancholy which called
forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), the young man declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had been awfully bored during
the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) studies. The law irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), other vocations
attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mother never ceased worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) in every one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) letters. As they talked they explained more and more fully the
motives of their sadness, working themselves up in their progressive
confidence. But they sometimes stopped short of the complete exposition
of their thought, and then sought to invent a phrase that might express
it all the same. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not confess her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passion for another; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) did not
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) no longer remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) suppers with girls after masked
balls; and no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not recollect the rendezvous of old when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
ran across the fields in the morning to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lover's house. The noises
of the town hardly reached them, and the room seemed small, as if
on purpose to hem in their solitude more closely. Emma, in a dimity
dressing-gown, leant her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head against the back of the old arm-chair; the
yellow wall-paper formed, as it were, a golden background behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bare head was mirrored in the glass with the white parting in
the middle, and the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ears peeping out from the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But pardon me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is wrong of me. I weary you with my
eternal complaints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, never, never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on, raising to the ceiling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) beautiful eyes,
in which a tear was trembling, <div class="bookquote">``all that I had dreamed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I! Oh, I too have suffered! Often I went out; I went away. I
dragged myself along the quays, seeking distraction amid the din of the
crowd without being able to banish the heaviness that weighed upon me.
In an engraver's shop on the boulevard there is an Italian print of one
of the Muses. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is draped in a tunic, and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is looking at the
moon, with forget-me-nots in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) flowing hair. Something drove me there
continually; I stayed there hours together.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then in a trembling voice,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) resembled you a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Bovary turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might not see the
irrepressible smile she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt rising to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Often,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I wrote you letters that I tore up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sometimes fancied that some chance would bring you. I thought I
recognised you at street-corners, and I ran after all the carriages
through whose windows I saw a shawl fluttering, a veil like yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed resolved to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) go on speaking without interruption.
Crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms and bending down her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at the rosettes
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) slippers, and at intervals made little movements inside the satin
of them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) toes.

<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the most wretched thing, is it not--is to drag out, as I do, a
useless existence. If our pains were only of some use to someone, we
should find consolation in the thought of the sacrifice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) started off in praise of virtue, duty, and silent immolation, having
himself an incredible longing for self-sacrifice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not
satisfy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should much like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to be a nurse at a hospital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! men have none of these holy missions, and I see nowhere any
calling--unless perhaps that of a doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>With a slight shrug of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulders, Emma interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to speak of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) illness, which had almost killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). What a pity! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should not be
suffering now! Leon at once envied the calm of the tomb, and one evening
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had even made his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) will, asking to be buried in that beautiful rug
with velvet stripes he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). For this was how they
would have wished to be, each setting up an ideal to which they were now
adapting their past life. Besides, speech is a rolling-mill that always
thins out the sentiment.

<p/>But at this invention of the rug she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Because I loved you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>And congratulating
himself at having surmounted the difficulty, Leon watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face out
of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>It was like the sky when a gust of wind drives the clouds across. The
mass of sad thoughts that darkened them seemed to be lifted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
blue eyes; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whole face shone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) waited. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always suspected it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they went over all the trifling events of that far-off existence,
whose joys and sorrows they had just summed up in one word. They
recalled the arbour with clematis, the dresses she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had worn, the
furniture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room, the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And our poor cactuses, where are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The cold killed them this winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! how I have thought of them, do you know? I often saw them again as
of yore, when on the summer mornings the sun beat down upon your blinds,
and I saw your two bare arms passing out amongst the flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>).

<p/>Leon swiftly pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) lips to it. Then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had taken a deep
breath--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At that time you were to me I know not what incomprehensible force that
took captive my life. Once, for instance, I went to see you; but you, no
doubt, do not remember it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were downstairs in the ante-room, ready to go out, standing on
the last stair; you were wearing a bonnet with small blue flowers; and
without any invitation from you, in spite of myself, I went with you.
Every moment, however, I grew more and more conscious of my folly, and
I went on walking by you, not daring to follow you completely, and
unwilling to leave you. When you went into a shop, I waited in the
street, and I watched you through the window taking off your gloves and
counting the change on the counter. Then you rang at Madame Tuvache's;
you were let in, and I stood like an idiot in front of the great heavy
door that had closed after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Bovary, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), wondered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so old. All
these things reappearing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to widen out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life; it was
like some sentimental immensity to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) returned; and from time to
time she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said in a low voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes half closed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is true--true--true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They heard eight strike on the different clocks of the Beauvoisine
quarter, which is full of schools, churches, and large empty hotels.
They no longer spoke, but they felt as they looked upon each other a
buzzing in their heads, as if something sonorous had escaped from the
fixed eyes of each of them. They were hand in hand now, and the past,
the future, reminiscences and dreams, all were confounded in the
sweetness of this ecstasy. Night was darkening over the walls, on which
still shone, half hidden in the shade, the coarse colours of four bills
representing four scenes from the <div class="bookquote">``Tour de Nesle,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a motto in
Spanish and French at the bottom. Through the sash-window a patch of
dark sky was seen between the pointed roofs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) rose to light two wax-candles on the drawers, then she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sat down
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) replied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was thinking how to resume the interrupted conversation, when she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it that no one until now has ever expressed such sentiments to
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The clerk said that ideal natures were difficult to understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) from
the first moment had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) despaired when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) thought of the
happiness that would have been theirs, if thanks to fortune, meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
earlier, they had been indissolubly bound to one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have sometimes thought of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a dream!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>murmured Leon. And fingering gently the blue binding of
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) long white sash, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``And who prevents us from beginning now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``I am too old; you are too young. Forget
me! Others will love you; you will love them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a child you are! Come, let us be sensible. I wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) the impossibility of their love, and that they must
remain, as formerly, on the simple terms of a fraternal friendship.

<p/>Was she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) speaking thus seriously? No doubt Emma did not herself know,
quite absorbed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was by the charm of the seduction, and the
necessity of defending herself from it; and contemplating the young
man with a moved look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gently repulsed the timid caresses that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
trembling hands attempted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! forgive me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, drawing back.

<p/>Emma was seized with a vague fear at this shyness, more dangerous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
than the boldness of Rodolphe when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) advanced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) open-armed. No man
had ever seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so beautiful. An exquisite candour emanated from
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long fine eyelashes, that curled upwards.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheek, with the soft skin reddened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, with desire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
person, and Emma felt an invincible longing to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips to it.
Then, leaning towards the clock as if to see the time--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! how late it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``how we do chatter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understood the hint and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has even made me forget the theatre. And poor Bovary has left me
here especially for that. Monsieur Lormeaux, of the Rue Grand-Pont, was
to take me and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And the opportunity was lost, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to leave the next day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to tell you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something--important--serious. Oh, no! Besides, you will not go; it is
impossible. If you should--listen to me. Then you have not understood
me; you have not guessed--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you speak plainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you can jest. Enough! enough! Oh, for pity's sake, let me see you
once--only once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped; then, as if thinking better of it, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, not here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to reflect; then abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow at eleven
o’clock in the cathedral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) cried, seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) disengaged.

<p/>And as they were both standing up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and Emma with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head
bent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) stooped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and pressed long kisses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mad! Ah! you are mad!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, with sounding little laughs,
while the kisses multiplied.

<p/>Then bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) seemed to beg the consent of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes. They fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) full of an icy dignity.

<p/>Leon stepped back to go out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) stopped on the threshold; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
whispered with a trembling voice, <div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered with a nod, and disappeared like a bird into the next room.

<p/>In the evening Emma wrote the clerk an interminable letter, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
cancelled the rendezvous; all was over; they must not, for the sake of
their happiness, meet again. But when the letter was finished, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
did not know Leon's address, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was puzzled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning, at the open window, and humming on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) balcony, Leon
himself varnished his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) pumps with several coatings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) put on white
trousers, fine socks, a green coat, emptied all the scent he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) handkerchief, then having had his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hair curled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) uncurled it again,
in order to give it a more natural elegance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is still too early,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) thought, looking at the hairdresser's
cuckoo-clock, that pointed to the hour of nine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) read an old fashion
journal, went out, smoked a cigar, walked up three streets, thought it
was time, and went slowly towards the porch of Notre Dame.

<p/>It was a beautiful summer morning. Silver plate sparkled in the
jeweller's windows, and the light falling obliquely on the cathedral
made mirrors of the corners of the grey stones; a flock of birds
fluttered in the grey sky round the trefoil bell-turrets; the square,
resounding with cries, was fragrant with the flowers that bordered its
pavement, roses, jasmines, pinks, narcissi, and tube-roses, unevenly
spaced out between moist grasses, catmint, and chickweed for the birds;
the fountains gurgled in the centre, and under large umbrellas, amidst
melons, piled up in heaps, flower-women, bare-headed, were twisting
paper round bunches of violets.

<p/>The young man took one. It was the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had bought flowers
for a woman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smelt them, swelled with pride, as if
this homage that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant for another had recoiled upon himself.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was afraid of being seen; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolutely entered the church. The
beadle, who was just then standing on the threshold in the middle of the
left doorway, under the <div class="bookquote">``Dancing Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>The beadle rapier</b></font>)</div>with feather cap, and rapier
dangling against his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) calves, came in, more majestic than a cardinal, and
as shining as a saint on a holy pyx.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) came towards Leon, and, with that smile of wheedling benignity
assumed by ecclesiastics when they question children--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The gentleman, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? The gentleman
would like to see the curiosities of the church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) first went round the lower aisles. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went out to look at
the Place. Emma was not coming yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went up again to the choir.

<p/>The nave was reflected in the full fonts with the beginning of the
arches and some portions of the glass windows. But the reflections of
the paintings, broken by the marble rim, were continued farther on upon
the flag-stones, like a many-coloured carpet. The broad daylight from
without streamed into the church in three enormous rays from the three
opened portals. From time to time at the upper end a sacristan passed,
making the oblique genuflexion of devout persons in a hurry. The crystal
lustres hung motionless. In the choir a silver lamp was burning, and
from the side chapels and dark places of the church sometimes rose
sounds like sighs, with the clang of a closing grating, its echo
reverberating under the lofty vault.

<p/>Leon with solemn steps walked along by the walls. Life had never seemed
so good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>) would come directly, charming, agitated, looking
back at the glances that followed her (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>), and with her (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>) flounced dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>)
gold eyeglass, her (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>) thin shoes, with all sorts of elegant trifles that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
had never enjoyed, and with the ineffable seduction of yielding virtue.
The church like a huge boudoir spread around her (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>); the arches bent down
to gather in the shade the confession of her (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>) love; the windows shone
resplendent to illumine her (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>) face, and the censers would burn that she (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>)
might appear like an angel amid the fumes of the sweet-smelling odours.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>sacristan</b></font>) did not come. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) sat down on a chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) eyes fell upon a
blue stained window representing boatmen carrying baskets. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) looked at
it long, attentively, and he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) counted the scales of the fishes and the
button-holes of the doublets, while his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) thoughts wandered off towards
Emma.

<p/>The beadle, standing aloof, was inwardly angry at this individual who
took the liberty of admiring the cathedral by himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>)
to be conducting himself in a monstrous fashion, to be robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) in a
sort, and almost committing sacrilege.

<p/>But a rustle of silk on the flags, the tip of a bonnet, a lined
cloak--it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)! Leon rose and ran to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>Emma was pale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, holding out a paper to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) abruptly withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand to enter the chapel of the Virgin,
where, kneeling on a chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to pray.

<p/>The young man was irritated at this bigot fancy; then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nevertheless
experienced a certain charm in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), in the middle of a
rendezvous, thus lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) devotions, like an Andalusian marchioness;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew bored, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed never coming to an end.

<p/>Emma prayed, or rather strove to pray, hoping that some sudden
resolution might descend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from heaven; and to draw down divine
aid she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) filled full her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes with the splendours of the tabernacle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
breathed in the perfumes of the full-blown flowers in the large vases,
and listened to the stillness of the church, that only heightened the
tumult of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rose, and they were about to leave, when the beadle came forward,
hurriedly saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? Madame would like to
see the curiosities of the church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>cried the clerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>). For she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) clung with her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) expiring virtue to the
Virgin, the sculptures, the tombs--anything.

<p/>Then, in order to proceed <div class="bookquote">``by rule,''  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>the beadle conducted them right to
the entrance near the square, where, pointing out with his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) cane a large
circle of block-stones without inscription or carving--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) said majestically, <div class="bookquote">``is the circumference of the beautiful
bell of Ambroise. It weighed forty thousand pounds. There was not its
equal in all Europe. The workman who cast it died of the joy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon.

<p/>The old fellow started off again; then, having got back to the chapel of
the Virgin, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) stretched forth his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arm with an all-embracing gesture
of demonstration, and, prouder than a country squire showing you his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
espaliers, went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This simple stone covers Pierre de Breze, lord of Varenne and of
Brissac, grand marshal of Poitou, and governor of Normandy, who died at
the battle of Montlhery on the 16th of July, 1465.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Leon bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) lips, fuming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And on the right, this gentleman all encased in iron, on the
prancing horse, is his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grandson, Louis de Breze, lord of Breval and of
Montchauvet, Count de Maulevrier, Baron de Mauny, chamberlain to the
king, Knight of the Order, and also governor of Normandy; died on the
23rd of July, 1531--a Sunday, as the inscription specifies; and below,
this figure, about to descend into the tomb, portrays the same person.
It is not possible, is it, to see a more perfect representation of
annihilation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Bovary put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) eyeglasses. Leon, motionless, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>),
no longer even attempting to speak a single word, to make a gesture,
so discouraged was he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) at this two-fold obstinacy of gossip and
indifference.

<p/>The everlasting guide went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Near him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), this kneeling woman who weeps is his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) spouse, Diane de
Poitiers, Countess de Breze, Duchess de Valentinois, born in 1499, died
in 1566, and to the left, the one with the child is the Holy Virgin. Now
turn to this side; here are the tombs of the Ambroise. They were both
cardinals and archbishops of Rouen. That one was minister under Louis
XII. He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) did a great deal for the cathedral. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) will he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) left thirty
thousand gold crowns for the poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And without stopping, still talking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) pushed them into a chapel
full of balustrades, some put away, and disclosed a kind of block that
certainly might once have been an ill-made statue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) said with a groan, <div class="bookquote">``it adorned the tomb of Richard Coeur de
Lion, King of England and Duke of Normandy. It was the Calvinists, sir,
who reduced it to this condition. They had buried it for spite in the
earth, under the episcopal seat of Monsignor. See! this is the door by
which Monsignor passes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsignor</b></font>) house. Let us pass on quickly to see the
gargoyle windows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Leon hastily took some silver from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) pocket and seized Emma's
arm. The beadle stood dumfounded, not able to understand this untimely
munificence when there were still so many things for the stranger to
see. So calling him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) back, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) cried--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir! sir! The steeple! the steeple!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wrong, sir! It is four hundred and forty feet high, nine less
than the great pyramid of Egypt. It is all cast; it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div><p/>Leon was fleeing, for it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) love, that for nearly
two hours now had become petrified in the church like the stones, would
vanish like a vapour through that sort of truncated funnel, of oblong
cage, of open chimney that rises so grotesquely from the cathedral like
the extravagant attempt of some fantastic brazier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where are we going?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said.

<p/>Making no answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) walked on with a rapid step; and Madame Bovary
was already, dipping her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) finger in the holy water when behind them they
heard a panting breath interrupted by the regular sound of a cane. Leon
turned back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) recognised the beadle, holding under his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) arms and balancing
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) stomach some twenty large sewn volumes. They were works
<div class="bookquote">``which treated of the cathedral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Idiot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>growled Leon, rushing out of the church.

<p/>A lad was playing about the close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and get me a cab!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child bounded off like a ball by the Rue Quatre-Vents; then they
were alone a few minutes, face to face, and a little embarrassed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Leon! Really--I don't know--if I ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) whispered. Then with a
more serious air, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, it is very improper--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>replied the clerk. <div class="bookquote">``It is done at Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And that, as an irresistible argument, decided her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).

<p/>Still the cab did not come. Leon was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) might go back into the
church. At last the cab appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At all events, go out by the north porch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>cried the beadle, who was
left alone on the threshold, <div class="bookquote">``so as to see the Resurrection, the Last
Judgment, Paradise, King David, and the Condemned in Hell-flames.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>asked the coachman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>said Leon, forcing Emma into the cab.

<p/>And the lumbering machine set out. It went down the Rue Grand-Pont,
crossed the Place des Arts, the Quai Napoleon, the Pont Neuf, and
stopped short before the statue of Pierre Corneille.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a voice that came from within.

<p/>The cab went on again, and as soon as it reached the Carrefour
Lafayette, set off down-hill, and entered the station at a gallop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, straight on!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the same voice.

<p/>The cab came out by the gate, and soon having reached the Cours, trotted
quietly beneath the elm-trees. The coachman wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) brow, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>)
leather hat between his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) knees, and drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) carriage beyond the side
alley by the meadow to the margin of the waters.

<p/>It went along by the river, along the towing-path paved with sharp
pebbles, and for a long while in the direction of Oyssel, beyond the
isles.

<p/>But suddenly it turned with a dash across Quatremares, Sotteville, La
Grande-Chaussee, the Rue d’Elbeuf, and made its third halt in front of
the Jardin des Plantes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get on, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the voice more furiously.

<p/>And at once resuming its course, it passed by Saint-Sever, by the
Quai'des Curandiers, the Quai aux Meules, once more over the bridge, by
the Place du Champ de Mars, and behind the hospital gardens, where old
men in black coats were walking in the sun along the terrace all green
with ivy. It went up the Boulevard Bouvreuil, along the Boulevard
Cauchoise, then the whole of Mont-Riboudet to the Deville hills.

<p/>It came back; and then, without any fixed plan or direction, wandered
about at hazard. The cab was seen at Saint-Pol, at Lescure, at Mont
Gargan, at La Rougue-Marc and Place du Gaillardbois; in the Rue
Maladrerie, Rue Dinanderie, before Saint-Romain, Saint-Vivien,
Saint-Maclou, Saint-Nicaise--in front of the Customs, at the <div class="bookquote">``Vieille
Tour,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``Trois Pipes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the Monumental Cemetery. From time to time
the coachman, on his (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>) box cast despairing eyes at the public-houses.
He (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>) could not understand what furious desire for locomotion urged these
individuals never to wish to stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>) tried to now and then, and at
once exclamations of anger burst forth behind him (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>) lashed his (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>)
perspiring jades afresh, but indifferent to their jolting, running up
against things here and there, not caring if he (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>) did, demoralised, and
almost weeping with thirst, fatigue, and depression.

<p/>And on the harbour, in the midst of the drays and casks, and in the
streets, at the corners, the good folk opened large wonder-stricken
eyes at this sight, so extraordinary in the provinces, a cab with blinds
drawn, and which appeared thus constantly shut more closely than a tomb,
and tossing about like a vessel.

<p/>Once in the middle of the day, in the open country, just as the sun
beat most fiercely against the old plated lanterns, a bared hand passed
beneath the small blinds of yellow canvas, and threw out some scraps
of paper that scattered in the wind, and farther off lighted like white
butterflies on a field of red clover all in bloom.

<p/>At about six o’clock the carriage stopped in a back street of the
Beauvoisine Quarter, and a woman got out, who walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) veil down,
and without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head.



<p/>Chapter Two

<p/>On reaching the inn, Madame Bovary was surprised not to see the
diligence. Hivert, who had waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fifty-three minutes, had at
last started.

<p/>Yet nothing forced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to go; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) word that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
return that same evening. Moreover, Charles expected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
heart she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt already that cowardly docility that is for some women at
once the chastisement and atonement of adultery.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) packed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) box quickly, paid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bill, took a cab in the yard,
hurrying on the driver, urging him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) on, every moment inquiring about
the time and the miles traversed. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) succeeded in catching up the
<div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as it neared the first houses of Quincampoix.

<p/>Hardly was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) corner than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, and opened
them at the foot of the hill, when from afar she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) recognised Felicite,
who was on the lookout in front of the farrier's shop. Hivert pulled
in his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) horses and, the servant, climbing up to the window, said
mysteriously--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame, you must go at once to Monsieur Homais. It's for something
important.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>The village was silent as usual. At the corner of the streets were small
pink heaps that smoked in the air, for this was the time for jam-making,
and everyone at Yonville prepared his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) supply on the same day. But in
front of the chemist's shop one might admire a far larger heap, and that
surpassed the others with the superiority that a laboratory must have
over ordinary stores, a general need over individual fancy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) went in. The large arm-chair was upset, and even the <div class="bookquote">``Fanal de
Rouen''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>lay on the ground, outspread between two pestles. She (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) pushed open
the lobby door, and in the middle of the kitchen, amid brown jars full
of picked currants, of powdered sugar and lump sugar, of the scales on
the table, and of the pans on the fire, she (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) saw all the Homais, small
and large, with aprons reaching to their chins, and with forks in their
hands. Justin was standing up with bowed head, and the chemist was
screaming--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you to go and fetch it in the Capharnaum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it? What is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>replied the druggist. <div class="bookquote">``We are making preserves; they are
simmering; but they were about to boil over, because there is too
much juice, and I ordered another pan. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), from indolence, from
laziness, went and took, hanging on its nail in my laboratory, the key
of the Capharnaum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>It was thus the druggist called a small room under the leads, full of
the utensils and the goods of his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) trade. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) often spent long hours there
alone, labelling, decanting, and doing up again; and he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) looked upon
it not as a simple store, but as a veritable sanctuary, whence there
afterwards issued, elaborated by his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) hands, all sorts of pills, boluses,
infusions, lotions, and potions, that would bear far and wide his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)
celebrity. No one in the world set foot there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) respected it so,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) swept it himself. Finally, if the pharmacy, open to all comers,
was the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) displayed his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) pride, the Capharnaum was the refuge
where, egoistically concentrating himself, Homais delighted in the
exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) predilections, so that Justin's thoughtlessness seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) a monstrous piece of irreverence, and, redder than the currants,
he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) repeated--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, from the Capharnaum! The key that locks up the acids and caustic
alkalies! To go and get a spare pan! a pan with a lid! and that I
shall perhaps never use! Everything is of importance in the delicate
operations of our art! But, devil take it! one must make distinctions,
and not employ for almost domestic purposes that which is meant for
pharmaceutical! It is as if one were to carve a fowl with a scalpel; as
if a magistrate--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now be calm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div>said Madame Homais.

<p/>And Athalie, pulling at his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) coat, cried <div class="bookquote">``Papa! papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Athalie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, let me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>went on the druggist <div class="bookquote">``let me alone, hang it! My
word! One might as well set up for a grocer. That's it! go it! respect
nothing! break, smash, let loose the leeches, burn the mallow-paste,
pickle the gherkins in the window jars, tear up the bandages!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you had--''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Presently! Do you know to what you exposed yourself? Didn't you see
anything in the corner, on the left, on the third shelf? Speak, answer,
articulate something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--don't--know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>stammered the young fellow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you don't know! Well, then, I do know! You saw a bottle of blue
glass, sealed with yellow wax, that contains a white powder, on which I
have even written `Dangerous!' And do you know what is in it? Arsenic!
And you go and touch it! You take a pan that was next to it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next to it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div>cried Madame Homais, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Arsenic! You
might have poisoned us all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>And the children began howling as if they already had frightful pains in
their entrails.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or poison a patient!''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>continued the druggist. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to see me
in the prisoner's dock with criminals, in a court of justice? To see
me dragged to the scaffold? Don't you know what care I take in managing
things, although I am so thoroughly used to it? Often I am horrified
myself when I think of my responsibility; for the Government persecutes
us, and the absurd legislation that rules us is a veritable Damocles'
sword over our heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma no longer dreamed of asking what they wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) for, and the
druggist went on in breathless phrases--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is your return for all the kindness we have shown you! That is how
you recompense me for the really paternal care that I lavish on you! For
without me where would you be? What would you be doing? Who provides
you with food, education, clothes, and all the means of figuring one day
with honour in the ranks of society? But you must pull hard at the oar
if you're to do that, and get, as, people say, callosities upon your
hands. Fabricando fit faber, age quod agis.*''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>* The worker lives by working, do what he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) will.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) was so exasperated he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) quoted Latin. He (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) would have quoted Chinese
or Greenlandish had he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) known those two languages, for he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) was in one
of those crises in which the whole soul shows indistinctly what it
contains, like the ocean, which, in the storm, opens itself from the
seaweeds on its shores down to the sands of its abysses.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am beginning to repent terribly of having taken you up! I should
certainly have done better to have left you to rot in your poverty and
the dirt in which you were born. Oh, you'll never be fit for anything
but to herd animals with horns! You have no aptitude for science! You
hardly know how to stick on a label! And there you are, dwelling with me
snug as a parson, living in clover, taking your ease!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Emma, turning to Madame Homais, <div class="bookquote">``I was told to come here--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div>interrupted the good woman, with a sad air, <div class="bookquote">``how am I to
tell you? It is a misfortune!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not finish, the druggist was thundering--<div class="bookquote">``Empty it! Clean it!
Take it back! Be quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>And seizing Justin by the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) blouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) shook a book out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) pocket. The lad stooped, but Homais was the quicker, and, having
picked up the volume, contemplated it with staring eyes and open mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``CONJUGAL--LOVE!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) said, slowly separating the two words. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! very
good! very good! very pretty! And illustrations! Oh, this is too much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Homais came forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, do not touch it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The children</b></font>)</div><p/>The children wanted to look at the pictures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) said imperiously; and they went out.

<p/>First he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) walked up and down with the open volume in his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) hand, rolling
his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) eyes, choking, tumid, apoplectic. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) came straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>)
pupil, and, planting himself in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) with crossed arms--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you every vice, then, little wretch? Take care! you are on a
downward path. Did not you reflect that this infamous book might fall
in the hands of my children, kindle a spark in their minds, tarnish the
purity of Athalie, corrupt Napoleon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) is already formed like a man.
Are you quite sure, anyhow, that they have not read it? Can you certify
to me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But really, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``you wished to tell me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes! madame. Your father-in-law is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, Monsieur Bovary senior had expired the evening before suddenly
from an attack of apoplexy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) got up from table, and by way of
greater precaution, on account of Emma's sensibility, Charles had begged
Homais to break the horrible news to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gradually. Homais had thought
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) speech; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had rounded, polished it, made it rhythmical; it was
a masterpiece of prudence and transitions, of subtle turns and delicacy;
but anger had got the better of rhetoric.

<p/>Emma, giving up all chance of hearing any details, left the pharmacy;
for Monsieur Homais had taken up the thread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) vituperations.
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was growing calmer, and was now grumbling in a paternal tone
whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fanned himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) skull-cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that I entirely disapprove of the work. Its author was a
doctor! There are certain scientific points in it that it is not ill a
man should know, and I would even venture to say that a man must know.
But later--later! At any rate, not till you are man yourself and your
temperament is formed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>When Emma knocked at the door. Charles, who was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), came
forward with open arms and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gently to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). But at the contact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lips
the memory of the other seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
face shuddering.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know, I know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the letter in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother told the event without any
sentimental hypocrisy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only regretted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband had not received
the consolations of religion, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had died at Daudeville, in the
street, at the door of a cafe after a patriotic dinner with some
ex-officers.

<p/>Emma gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back the letter; then at dinner, for appearance's sake,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affected a certain repugnance. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to try, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
resolutely began eating, while Charles opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat motionless in a
dejected attitude.

<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a long look full of
distress. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``I should have liked to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was silent. At last, understanding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must say something, <div class="bookquote">``How
old was your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty-eight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And that was all.

<p/>A quarter of an hour after he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``My poor mother! what will become
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made a gesture that signified she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not know. Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so
taciturn, Charles imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) much affected, and forced himself to say
nothing, not to reawaken this sorrow which moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). And, shaking off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/>When the cloth was removed, Bovary did not rise, nor did Emma; and as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), the monotony of the spectacle drove little by little
all pity from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) paltry, weak, a cipher--in
a word, a poor thing in every way. How to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)? What an
interminable evening! Something stupefying like the fumes of opium
seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>They heard in the passage the sharp noise of a wooden leg on the boards.
It was Hippolyte bringing back Emma's luggage. In order to put it down
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) described painfully a quarter of a circle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stump.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't even remember any more about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, looking at
the poor devil, whose coarse red hair was wet with perspiration.

<p/>Bovary was searching at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) purse for a centime, and
without appearing to understand all there was of humiliation for him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
in the mere presence of this man, who stood there like a personified
reproach to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) incurable incapacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo! you've a pretty bouquet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, noticing Leon's violets on
the chimney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied indifferently; <div class="bookquote">``it's a bouquet I bought just now from
a beggar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles picked up the flowers, and freshening his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes, red with tears,
against them, smelt them delicately.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took them quickly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand and put them in a glass of water.

<p/>The next day Madame Bovary senior arrived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) son wept much.
Emma, on the pretext of giving orders, disappeared. The following day
they had a talk over the mourning. They went and sat down with their
workboxes by the waterside under the arbour.

<p/>Charles was thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father, and was surprised to feel so much
affection for this man, whom till then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared little
about. Madame Bovary senior was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband. The worst
days of the past seemed enviable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). All was forgotten beneath the
instinctive regret of such a long habit, and from time to time whilst
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sewed, a big tear rolled along her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nose and hung suspended there a
moment. Emma was thinking that it was scarcely forty-eight hours since
they had been together, far from the world, all in a frenzy of joy, and
not having eyes enough to gaze upon each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to recall the
slightest details of that past day. But the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband and
mother-in-law worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have liked to hear nothing, to see
nothing, so as not to disturb the meditation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) love, that, do what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would, became lost in external sensations.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was unpicking the lining of a dress, and the strips were scattered
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Madame Bovary senior was plying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) scissor without looking
up, and Charles, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) list slippers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) old brown surtout that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
used as a dressing-gown, sat with both hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pockets, and did not
speak either; near them Berthe, in a little white pinafore, was raking
sand in the walks with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spade. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Monsieur Lheureux,
the linendraper, come in through the gate.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) services <div class="bookquote">``under the sad circumstances.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Emma
answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could do without. The shopkeeper was not
to be beaten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I should like to have a private talk
with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``It's about that affair--you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles crimsoned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! certainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>And in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
confusion, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you, my darling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rose; and Charles said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
mother, <div class="bookquote">``It is nothing particular. No doubt, some household trifle.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
did not want her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to know the story of the bill, fearing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reproaches.

<p/>As soon as they were alone, Monsieur Lheureux in sufficiently clear
terms began to congratulate Emma on the inheritance, then to talk of
indifferent matters, of the espaliers, of the harvest, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own
health, which was always so-so, always having ups and downs. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
had to work devilish hard, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) didn't make enough, in spite of
all people said, to find butter for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bread.

<p/>Emma let him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) talk on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had bored herself so prodigiously the last two
days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you're quite well again?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``Ma foi! I saw your
husband in a sad state. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s a good fellow, though we did have a little
misunderstanding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked what misunderstanding, for Charles had said nothing of the
dispute about the goods supplied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you know well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>cried Lheureux. <div class="bookquote">``It was about your little
fancies--the travelling trunks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
back, smiling and whistling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looked straight at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in an unbearable
manner. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) suspect anything?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was lost in all kinds of apprehensions. At last, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went
on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We made it up, all the same, and I've come again to propose another
arrangement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This was to renew the bill Bovary had signed. The doctor, of course,
would do as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pleased; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was not to trouble himself, especially just
now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would have a lot of worry. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would do better to give
it over to someone else--to you, for example. With a power of attorney
it could be easily managed, and then we -LRB-you and I-RRB- would have our
little business transactions together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was silent. Then, passing to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) trade,
Lheureux declared that madame must require something. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
a black barege, twelve yards, just enough to make a gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The one you've on is good enough for the house, but you want another
for calls. I saw that the very moment that I came in. I've the eye of an
American!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not send the stuff; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brought it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) came again to measure
it; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) came again on other pretexts, always trying to make himself
agreeable, useful, <div class="bookquote">``enfeoffing himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as Homais would have said, and
always dropping some hint to Emma about the power of attorney. He (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) never
mentioned the bill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not think of it. Charles, at the beginning
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convalescence, had certainly said something about it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
but so many emotions had passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) no longer
remembered it. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took care not to talk of any money
questions. Madame Bovary seemed surprised at this, and attributed the
change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ways to the religious sentiments she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had contracted during
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) illness.

<p/>But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was gone, Emma greatly astounded Bovary by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
practical good sense. It would be necessary to make inquiries, to look
into mortgages, and see if there were any occasion for a sale by auction
or a liquidation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quoted technical terms casually, pronounced the
grand words of order, the future, foresight, and constantly exaggerated
the difficulties of settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's affairs so much, that at last
one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the rough draft of a power of attorney to manage
and administer his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) business, arrange all loans, sign and endorse all
bills, pay all sums, etc.. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had profited by Lheureux's lessons.
Charles naively asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) where this paper came from.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Guillaumin'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and with the utmost coolness she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
trust him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) overmuch. Notaries have such a bad reputation. Perhaps we
ought to consult--we only know--no one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless Leon--''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>replied Charles, who was reflecting. But it was
difficult to explain matters by letter. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) offered to make the
journey, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) insisted. It was quite a contest of
mutual consideration. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried with affected waywardness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How good you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forehead.

<p/>The next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) set out in the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to go to Rouen to
consult Monsieur Leon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stayed there three days.



<p/>Chapter Three

<p/>They were three full, exquisite days--a true honeymoon. They were at
the Hotel-de-Boulogne, on the harbour; and they lived there, with drawn
blinds and closed doors, with flowers on the floor, and iced syrups were
brought them early in the morning.

<p/>Towards evening they took a covered boat and went to dine on one of the
islands. It was the time when one hears by the side of the dockyard the
caulking-mallets sounding against the hull of vessels. The smoke of
the tar rose up between the trees; there were large fatty drops on the
water, undulating in the purple colour of the sun, like floating plaques
of Florentine bronze.

<p/>They rowed down in the midst of moored boats, whose long oblique cables
grazed lightly against the bottom of the boat. The din of the town
gradually grew distant; the rolling of carriages, the tumult of voices,
the yelping of dogs on the decks of vessels. She (<font color='blue'><b>Florentine</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Florentine</b></font>) bonnet,
and they landed on their island.

<p/>They sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern, at whose door hung
black nets. They ate fried smelts, cream and cherries. They lay down
upon the grass; they kissed behind the poplars; and they would fain,
like two Robinsons, have lived for ever in this little place, which
seemed to them in their beatitude the most magnificent on earth. It was
not the first time that they had seen trees, a blue sky, meadows; that
they had heard the water flowing and the wind blowing in the leaves;
but, no doubt, they had never admired all this, as if Nature had
not existed before, or had only begun to be beautiful since the
gratification of their desires.

<p/>At night they returned. The boat glided along the shores of the islands.
They sat at the bottom, both hidden by the shade, in silence. The square
oars rang in the iron thwarts, and, in the stillness, seemed to mark
time, like the beating of a metronome, while at the stern the rudder
that trailed behind never ceased its gentle splash against the water.

<p/>Once the moon rose; they did not fail to make fine phrases, finding the
orb melancholy and full of poetry. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) even began to sing--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One night, do you remember, we were sailing,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>etc..

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) musical but weak voice died away along the waves, and the winds
carried off the trills that Leon heard pass like the flapping of wings
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), leaning against the partition of the shallop,
through one of whose raised blinds the moon streamed in. Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) black
dress, whose drapery spread out like a fan, made her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) seem more slender,
taller. Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head was raised, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hands clasped, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) eyes turned towards
heaven. At times the shadow of the willows hid her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) completely; then she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
reappeared suddenly, like a vision in the moonlight.

<p/>Leon, on the floor by her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) side, found under his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hand a ribbon of scarlet
silk. The boatman looked at it, and at last said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it belongs to the party I took out the other day. A lot
of jolly folk, gentlemen and ladies, with cakes, champagne,
cornets--everything in style! There was one especially, a tall handsome
man with small moustaches, who was that funny! And they all kept saying,
`Now tell us something, Adolphe--Dolpe,' I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boatman</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) shivered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in pain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>asked Leon, coming closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's nothing! No doubt, it is only the night air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who doesn't want for women, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div>softly added the sailor,
thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was paying the stranger a compliment.

<p/>Then, spitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) took the oars again.

<p/>Yet they had to part. The adieux were sad. He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was to send his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) letters to
Mere Rollet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) such precise instructions about a double
envelope that he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) admired greatly her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) amorous astuteness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you can assure me it is all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said with her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) last kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) thought afterwards as he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) came back through the streets
alone, <div class="bookquote">``is she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so very anxious to get this power of attorney?''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter Four

<p/>Leon soon put on an air of superiority before his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) comrades, avoided
their company, and completely neglected his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) work.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) letters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) re-read them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) called
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) to mind with all the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) desires and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) memories.
Instead of lessening with absence, this longing to see her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) again grew,
so that at last on Saturday morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) office.

<p/>When, from the summit of the hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) saw in the valley below the
church-spire with its tin flag swinging in the wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) felt that
delight mingled with triumphant vanity and egoistic tenderness that
millionaires must experience when they come back to their native
village.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went rambling round her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) house. A light was burning in the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
watched for her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) shadow behind the curtains, but nothing appeared.

<p/>Mere Lefrancois, when she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>), uttered many exclamations. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``had grown and was thinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>while Artemise, on the contrary,
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) stouter and darker.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) dined in the little room as of yore, but alone, without the
tax-gatherer; for Binet, tired of waiting for the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Binet/Monsieur Binet</b></font>)</div>had
definitely put forward his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) meal one hour, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) dined punctually at
five, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) declared usually the rickety old concern <div class="bookquote">``was late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Leon, however, made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mind, and knocked at the doctor's door.
Madame was in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) room, and did not come down for a quarter of an hour.
The doctor seemed delighted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) never stirred out that
evening, nor all the next day.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) alone in the evening, very late, behind the garden in the
lane; in the lane, as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had the other one! It was a stormy night, and
they talked under an umbrella by lightning flashes.

<p/>Their separation was becoming intolerable. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather die!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said
Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was writhing in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) arms, weeping. <div class="bookquote">``Adieu! adieu! When shall I
see you again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They came back again to embrace once more, and it was then that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to find soon, by no matter what means, a regular
opportunity for seeing one another in freedom at least once a week. Emma
never doubted she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should be able to do this. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was full of
hope. Some money was coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>On the strength of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bought a pair of yellow curtains with large
stripes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room, whose cheapness Monsieur Lheureux had commended;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dreamed of getting a carpet, and Lheureux, declaring that it wasn't
<div class="bookquote">``drinking the sea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>politely undertook to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could
no longer do without his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) services. Twenty times a day she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at once put by his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) business without a murmur. People could not
understand either why Mere Rollet breakfasted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) every day, and
even paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) private visits.

<p/>It was about this time, that is to say, the beginning of winter, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed seized with great musical fervour.

<p/>One evening when Charles was listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began the same piece
four times over, each time with much vexation, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), not noticing
any difference, cried--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo! very goodl You are wrong to stop. Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; it is execrable! My fingers are quite rusty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to play him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) something again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; to please you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>And Charles confessed she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had gone off a little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) played wrong notes
and blundered; then, stopping short--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it is no use. I ought to take some lessons; but--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips
and added, <div class="bookquote">``Twenty francs a lesson, that's too dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so it is--rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles, giggling stupidly. <div class="bookquote">``But it seems
to me that one might be able to do it for less; for there are artists of
no reputation, and who are often better than the celebrities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Find them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/>The next day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came home he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shyly, and at last could
no longer keep back the words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How obstinate you are sometimes! I went to Barfucheres to-day. Well,
Madame Liegard assured me that her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) three young ladies who are at
La Misericorde have lessons at fifty sous apiece, and that from an
excellent mistress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulders and did not open her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) piano again. But when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) passed by it -LRB-if Bovary were there-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sighed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my poor piano!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And when anyone came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not fail to inform them she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had given up music, and could not begin again now for important reasons.
Then people commiserated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity! she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had so much talent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>They even spoke to Bovary about it. They put him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to shame, and
especially the chemist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wrong. One should never let any of the faculties of nature lie
fallow. Besides, just think, my good friend, that by inducing madame to
study; you are economising on the subsequent musical education of
your child. For my own part, I think that mothers ought themselves to
instruct their children. That is an idea of Rousseau's, still rather
new perhaps, but that will end by triumphing, I am certain of it, like
mothers nursing their own children and vaccination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>So Charles returned once more to this question of the piano. Emma
replied bitterly that it would be better to sell it. This poor piano,
that had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) vanity so much satisfaction--to see it go was to
Bovary like the indefinable suicide of a part of herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you liked,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``a lesson from time to time, that wouldn't
after all be very ruinous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But lessons,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``are only of use when followed up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And thus it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) set about obtaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband's permission to go
to town once a week to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lover. At the end of a month she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was even
considered to have made considerable progress.



<p/>Chapter Five

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on Thursdays. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) got up and dressed silently, in order not to
awaken Charles, who would have made remarks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) getting ready too
early. Next she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked up and down, went to the windows, and looked out
at the Place. The early dawn was broadening between the pillars of the
market, and the chemist's shop, with the shutters still up, showed in
the pale light of the dawn the large letters of his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) signboard.

<p/>When the clock pointed to a quarter past seven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went off to the
<div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>whose door Artemise opened yawning. The girl then made
up the coals covered by the cinders, and Emma remained alone in the
kitchen. Now and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went out. Hivert was leisurely harnessing his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)
horses, listening, moreover, to Mere Lefrancois, who, passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head
and nightcap through a grating, was charging him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) with commissions and
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) explanations that would have confused anyone else. Emma kept
beating the soles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) boots against the pavement of the yard.

<p/>At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) had eaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) soup, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) cloak, lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) pipe,
and grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) whip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) calmly installed himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) seat.

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>passengers</b></font>)</div>started at a slow trot, and for about a mile stopped
here and there to pick up passengers who waited for it, standing at the
border of the road, in front of their yard gates.

<p/>Those who had secured seats the evening before kept it waiting; some
even were still in bed in their houses. Hivert called, shouted, swore;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) got down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) seat and went and knocked loudly at the doors.
The wind blew through the cracked windows.

<p/>The four seats, however, filled up. The carriage rolled off; rows of
apple-trees followed one upon another, and the road between its two long
ditches, full of yellow water, rose, constantly narrowing towards the
horizon.

<p/>Emma knew it from end to end; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew that after a meadow there was
a sign-post, next an elm, a barn, or the hut of a lime-kiln tender.
Sometimes even, in the hope of getting some surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) never lost the clear perception of the distance to be traversed.

<p/>At last the brick houses began to follow one another more closely, the
earth resounded beneath the wheels, the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>glided between the
gardens, where through an opening one saw statues, a periwinkle plant,
clipped yews, and a swing. Then on a sudden the town appeared. Sloping
down like an amphitheatre, and drowned in the fog, it widened out
beyond the bridges confusedly. Then the open country spread away with
a monotonous movement till it touched in the distance the vague line of
the pale sky. Seen thus from above, the whole landscape looked immovable
as a picture; the anchored ships were massed in one corner, the river
curved round the foot of the green hills, and the isles, oblique in
shape, lay on the water, like large, motionless, black fishes. The
factory chimneys belched forth immense brown fumes that were blown away
at the top. One heard the rumbling of the foundries, together with the
clear chimes of the churches that stood out in the mist. The leafless
trees on the boulevards made violet thickets in the midst of the
houses, and the roofs, all shining with the rain, threw back unequal
reflections, according to the height of the quarters in which they were.
Sometimes a gust of wind drove the clouds towards the Saint Catherine
hills, like aerial waves that broke silently against a cliff.

<p/>A giddiness seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to detach itself from this mass of existence,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart swelled as if the hundred and twenty thousand souls that
palpitated there had all at once sent into it the vapour of the passions
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fancied theirs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) love grew in the presence of this vastness, and
expanded with tumult to the vague murmurings that rose towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
poured it out upon the square, on the walks, on the streets, and the
old Norman city outspread before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes as an enormous capital, as a
Babylon into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was entering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) leant with both hands against
the window, drinking in the breeze; the three horses galloped, the
stones grated in the mud, the diligence rocked, and Hivert, from afar,
hailed the carts on the road, while the bourgeois who had spent the
night at the Guillaume woods came quietly down the hill in their little
family carriages.

<p/>They stopped at the barrier; Emma undid her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) overshoes, put on other
gloves, rearranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shawl, and some twenty paces farther she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) got down
from the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The town was then awakening. Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up the
shop-fronts, and women with baskets against their hips, at intervals
uttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked with
downcast eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with pleasure under her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
lowered black veil.

<p/>For fear of being seen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not usually take the most direct road.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plunged into dark alleys, and, all perspiring, reached the bottom
of the Rue Nationale, near the fountain that stands there. It is the
quarter for theatres, public-houses, and whores. Often a cart would
pass near her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), bearing some shaking scenery. Waiters in aprons were
sprinkling sand on the flagstones between green shrubs. It all smelt of
absinthe, cigars, and oysters.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned down a street; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) curling hair that
escaped from beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hat.

<p/>Leon walked along the pavement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) to the hotel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went
up, opened the door, entered--What an embrace!

<p/>Then, after the kisses, the words gushed forth. They told each other the
sorrows of the week, the presentiments, the anxiety for the letters; but
now everything was forgotten; they gazed into each other's faces with
voluptuous laughs, and tender names.

<p/>The bed was large, of mahogany, in the shape of a boat. The curtains
were in red levantine, that hung from the ceiling and bulged out too
much towards the bell-shaped bedside; and nothing in the world was so
lovely as her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) brown head and white skin standing out against this purple
colour, when, with a movement of shame, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bare arms,
hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hands.

<p/>The warm room, with its discreet carpet, its gay ornaments, and its
calm light, seemed made for the intimacies of passion. The curtain-rods,
ending in arrows, their brass pegs, and the great balls of the fire-dogs
shone suddenly when the sun came in. On the chimney between the
candelabra there were two of those pink shells in which one hears the
murmur of the sea if one holds them to the ear.

<p/>How they loved that dear room, so full of gaiety, despite its rather
faded splendour! They always found the furniture in the same place, and
sometimes hairpins, that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had forgotten the Thursday before, under
the pedestal of the clock. They lunched by the fireside on a little
round table, inlaid with rosewood. Emma carved, put bits on his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) plate
with all sorts of coquettish ways, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) laughed with a sonorous and
libertine laugh when the froth of the champagne ran over from the
glass to the rings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fingers. They were so completely lost in
the possession of each other that they thought themselves in their
own house, and that they would live there till death, like two spouses
eternally young. They said <div class="bookquote">``our room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``our carpet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even said <div class="bookquote">``my
slippers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>a gift of Leon's, a whim she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had had. They were pink satin,
bordered with swansdown. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) knees, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leg, then too
short, hung in the air, and the dainty shoe, that had no back to it, was
held only by the toes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bare foot.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) for the first time enjoyed the inexpressible delicacy of feminine
refinements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had never met this grace of language, this reserve of
clothing, these poses of the weary dove. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) admired the exaltation of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul and the lace on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) petticoat. Besides, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not <div class="bookquote">``a lady''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and a married woman--a real mistress, in fine?

<p/>By the diversity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) humour, in turn mystical or mirthful, talkative,
taciturn, passionate, careless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) awakened in him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) a thousand desires,
called up instincts or memories. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was the mistress of all the novels,
the heroine of all the dramas, the vague <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>the heroine</b></font>)</div>of all the volumes
of verse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) found again on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulder the amber colouring of the
<div class="bookquote">``Odalisque Bathing'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the long waist of feudal chatelaines, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resembled the <div class="bookquote">``Pale Woman of Barcelona.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But above all she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was the
Angel!

<p/>Often looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) soul, escaping towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), spread like a wave about the outline of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, and descended
drawn down into the whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) knelt on the ground
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and with both elbows on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knees looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a
smile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) face upturned.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), and murmured, as if choking with intoxication--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do not move! do not speak! look at me! Something so sweet comes
from your eyes that helps me so much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``child.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Child, do you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not listen for his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) answer in the haste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips that
fastened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>On the clock there was a bronze cupid, who smirked as he (<font color='blue'><b>cupid</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>cupid</b></font>) arm
beneath a golden garland. They had laughed at it many a time, but when
they had to part everything seemed serious to them.

<p/>Motionless in front of each other, they kept repeating, <div class="bookquote">``Till Thursday,
till Thursday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>cupid</b></font>) head between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands, kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>cupid</b></font>) hurriedly on
the forehead, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Adieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and rushed down the stairs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to a hairdresser's in the Rue de la Comedie to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair
arranged. Night fell; the gas was lighted in the shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard the
bell at the theatre calling the mummers to the performance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw,
passing opposite, men with white faces and women in faded gowns going in
at the stage-door.

<p/>It was hot in the room, small, and too low where the stove was hissing
in the midst of wigs and pomades. The smell of the tongs, together with
the greasy hands that handled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, soon stunned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dozed
a little in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wrapper. Often, as he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair, the man offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
tickets for a masked ball.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went up the streets; reached the Croix-Rouge,
put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) overshoes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had hidden in the morning under the seat,
and sank into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) place among the impatient passengers. Some got out
at the foot of the hill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) remained alone in the carriage. At every
turning all the lights of the town were seen more and more completely,
making a great luminous vapour about the dim houses. Emma knelt on the
cushions and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes wandered over the dazzling light. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sobbed;
called on Leon, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) tender words and kisses lost in the wind.

<p/>On the hillside a poor devil wandered about with his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) stick in the midst
of the diligences. A mass of rags covered his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) shoulders, and an old
staved-in beaver, turned out like a basin, hid his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) face; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
took it off he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) discovered in the place of eyelids empty and bloody
orbits. The flesh hung in red shreds, and there flowed from it liquids
that congealed into green scale down to the nose, whose black nostrils
sniffed convulsively. To speak to you he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head with an
idiotic laugh; then his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) bluish eyeballs, rolling constantly, at the
temples beat against the edge of the open wound. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sang a little song
as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) followed the carriages--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maids an the warmth of a summer day Dream of love, and of love always''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And all the rest was about birds and sunshine and green leaves.

<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) appeared suddenly behind Emma, bareheaded, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drew
back with a cry. Hivert made fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would advise him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to get a
booth at the Saint Romain fair, or else ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>), laughing, how his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) young
woman was.

<p/>Often they had started when, with a sudden movement, his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) hat entered the
diligence through the small window, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) clung with his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) other arm
to the footboard, between the wheels splashing mud. His (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) voice, feeble
at first and quavering, grew sharp; it resounded in the night like the
indistinct moan of a vague distress; and through the ringing of the
bells, the murmur of the trees, and the rumbling of the empty vehicle,
it had a far-off sound that disturbed Emma. It went to the bottom of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul, like a whirlwind in an abyss, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) away into the
distances of a boundless melancholy. But Hivert, noticing a weight
behind, gave the blind man sharp cuts with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whip. The thong lashed
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wounds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell back into the mud with a yell. Then the
passengers in the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>the passengers reflection</b></font>)</div>ended by falling asleep, some with open
mouths, others with lowered chins, leaning against their neighbour's
shoulder, or with their arm passed through the strap, oscillating
regularly with the jolting of the carriage; and the reflection of the
lantern swinging without, on the crupper of the wheeler; penetrating
into the interior through the chocolate calico curtains, threw
sanguineous shadows over all these motionless people. Emma, drunk with
grief, shivered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) clothes, feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feet grow colder and colder,
and death in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul.

<p/>Charles at home was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>was always late
on Thursdays. Madame arrived at last, and scarcely kissed the child. The
dinner was not ready. No matter! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) excused the servant. This girl now
seemed allowed to do just as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked.

<p/>Often her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband, noting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pallor, asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were unwell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``you seem so strange this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's nothing! nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There were even days when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no sooner come in than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) room; and Justin, happening to be there, moved about noiselessly,
quicker at helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) than the best of maids. He (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) put the matches
ready, the candlestick, a book, arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nightgown, turned back the
bedclothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that will do. Now you can go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) stood there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) hands hanging down and his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) eyes wide open, as if
enmeshed in the innumerable threads of a sudden reverie.

<p/>The following day was frightful, and those that came after still more
unbearable, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) impatience to once again seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) happiness;
an ardent lust, inflamed by the images of past experience, and that
burst forth freely on the seventh day beneath Leon's caresses. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
ardours were hidden beneath outbursts of wonder and gratitude. Emma
tasted this love in a discreet, absorbed fashion, maintained it by all
the artifices of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tenderness, and trembled a little lest it should be
lost later on.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) often said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sweet, melancholy voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you too, you will leave me! You will marry! You will be like all
the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``What others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, like all men,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied. Then added, repulsing him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) with a
languid movement--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are all evil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>One day, as they were talking philosophically of earthly disillusions,
to experiment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) jealousy, or yielding, perhaps, to an over-strong
need to pour out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) that formerly, before him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had loved someone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on quickly, protesting by the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) child
that <div class="bookquote">``nothing had passed between them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), but none the less questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to find out
what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was a ship's captain, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Was this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a
higher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man
who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage?

<p/>The clerk then felt the lowliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) longed for
epaulettes, crosses, titles. All that would please her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gathered that
from her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) spendthrift habits.

<p/>Emma nevertheless concealed many of these extravagant fancies, such as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wish to have a blue tilbury to drive into Rouen, drawn by an English
horse and driven by a groom in top-boots. It was Justin who had inspired
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with this whim, by begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) service as
valet-de-chambre*, and if the privation of it did not lessen the
pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arrival at each rendezvous, it certainly augmented the
bitterness of the return.

<p/>* Manservant.


<p/>Often, when they talked together of Paris, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ended by murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
how happy we should be there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we not happy?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>gently answered the young man passing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am mad. Kiss me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more charming than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pistachio-creams, and played him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waltzes after dinner. So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought
himself the most fortunate of men and Emma was without uneasiness, when,
one evening suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Mademoiselle Lempereur, isn't it, who gives you lessons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>Charles went on, <div class="bookquote">``at Madame Liegeard's. I
spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) about you, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>This was like a thunderclap. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied quite naturally--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) forgot my name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">``there are several Demoiselles Lempereur
at Rouen who are music-mistresses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then quickly--<div class="bookquote">``But I have my receipts here. See!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to the writing-table, ransacked all the drawers, rummaged
the papers, and at last lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head so completely that Charles
earnestly begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not to take so much trouble about those wretched
receipts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I will find them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/>And, in fact, on the following Friday, as Charles was putting on one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) boots in the dark cabinet where his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) clothes were kept, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) felt
a piece of paper between the leather and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took it out and
read--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Received, for three months' lessons and several pieces of music, the
sum of sixty-three francs.--Felicie Lempereur, professor of music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How the devil did it get into my boots?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``have fallen from the old box of bills that is
on the edge of the shelf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From that moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) existence was but one long tissue of lies, in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) love as in veils to hide it. It was a want, a mania,
a pleasure carried to such an extent that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the day
before walked on the right side of a road, one might know she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had taken
the left.

<p/>One morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had gone, as usual, rather lightly clothed, it
suddenly began to snow, and as Charles was watching the weather from the
window, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) caught sight of Monsieur Bournisien in the chaise of Monsieur
Tuvache, who was driving him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to Rouen. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went down to give the
priest a thick shawl that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was to hand over to Emma as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
reached the <div class="bookquote">``Croix-Rouge.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) got to the inn, Monsieur Bournisien
asked for the wife of the Yonville doctor. The landlady replied that
she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) very rarely came to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) establishment. So that evening, when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
recognised Madame Bovary in the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>the cure told her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
dilemma, without, however, appearing to attach much importance to it,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) began praising a preacher who was doing wonders at the Cathedral,
and whom all the ladies were rushing to hear.

<p/>Still, if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not ask for any explanation, others, later on, might
prove less discreet. So she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) thought well to get down each time at the
<div class="bookquote">``Croix-Rouge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>so that the good folk of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) village who saw her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) on the
stairs should suspect nothing.

<p/>One day, however, Monsieur Lheureux met her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) coming out of the Hotel
de Boulogne on Leon's arm; and she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was frightened, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) would
gossip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was not such a fool. But three days after he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
room, shut the door, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I must have some money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) declared she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) could not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) any. Lheureux burst into
lamentations and reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) of all the kindnesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).

<p/>In fact, of the two bills signed by Charles, Emma up to the present had
paid only one. As to the second, the shopkeeper, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) request, had
consented to replace it by another, which again had been renewed for a
long date. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) pocket a list of goods not paid for; to
wit, the curtains, the carpet, the material for the armchairs, several
dresses, and divers articles of dress, the bills for which amounted to
about two thousand francs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you haven't any ready money, you have an estate.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>)
reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of a miserable little hovel situated at Barneville, near
Aumale, that brought in almost nothing. It had formerly been part of a
small farm sold by Monsieur Bovary senior; for Lheureux knew everything,
even to the number of acres and the names of the neighbours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were in your place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I should clear myself of my debts,
and have money left over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pointed out the difficulty of getting a purchaser. He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) held out the
hope of finding one; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should manage to sell it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you your power of attorney?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) replied.

<p/>The phrase came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) like a breath of fresh air. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me the bill,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it isn't worth while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>answered Lheureux.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) came back the following week and boasted of having, after much
trouble, at last discovered a certain Langlois, who, for a long time,
had had an eye on the property, but without mentioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) price.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind the price!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried.

<p/>But they would, on the contrary, have to wait, to sound the fellow.
The thing was worth a journey, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not undertake it, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
offered to go to the place to have an interview with Langlois. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>)
return he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) announced that the purchaser proposed four thousand francs.

<p/>Emma was radiant at this news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Frankly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that's a good price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drew half the sum at once, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was about to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) account
the shopkeeper said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It really grieves me, on my word! to see you depriving yourself all at
once of such a big sum as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shopkeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at the bank-notes, and dreaming of the unlimited number
of rendezvous represented by those two thousand francs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stammered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! what!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) went on, laughing good-naturedly, <div class="bookquote">``one puts anything one likes
on receipts. Don't you think I know what household affairs are?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fixedly, while in his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) held two long papers that he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>)
slid between his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) nails. At last, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) pocket-book, he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) spread out
on the table four bills to order, each for a thousand francs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sign these,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and keep it all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried out, scandalised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I give you the surplus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>replied Monsieur Lheureux impudently,
<div class="bookquote">``is that not helping you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div><p/>And taking a pen he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) wrote at the bottom of the account, <div class="bookquote">``Received of
Madame Bovary four thousand francs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now who can trouble you, since in six months you'll draw the arrears
for your cottage, and I don't make the last bill due till after you've
been paid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma grew rather confused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) calculations, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ears tingled
as if gold pieces, bursting from their bags, rang all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) on
the floor. At last Lheureux explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) had a very good friend,
Vincart, a broker at Rouen, who would discount these four bills. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) himself would hand over to madame the remainder after the actual debt
was paid.

<p/>But instead of two thousand francs he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) brought only eighteen hundred, for
the friend Vincart -LRB-which was only fair-RRB- had deducted two hundred francs
for commission and discount. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) carelessly asked for a receipt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You understand--in business--sometimes. And with the date, if you
please, with the date.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>A horizon of realisable whims opened out before Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was prudent
enough to lay by a thousand crowns, with which the first three bills
were paid when they fell due; but the fourth, by chance, came to the
house on a Thursday, and Charles, quite upset, patiently awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wife's return for an explanation.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) about this bill, it was only to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) such
domestic worries; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knees, caressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), cooed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a long enumeration of all the indispensable things that had been got
on credit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, you must confess, considering the quantity, it isn't too dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wit's end, soon had recourse to the eternal Lheureux,
who swore he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would arrange matters if the doctor would sign him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) two
bills, one of which was for seven hundred francs, payable in three
months. In order to arrange for this he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother a pathetic
letter. Instead of sending a reply she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came herself; and when Emma
wanted to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had got anything out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
replied; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) wants to see the account.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The next morning at
daybreak Emma ran to Lheureux to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to make out another account for
not more than a thousand francs, for to show the one for four thousand
it would be necessary to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had paid two-thirds, and confess,
consequently, the sale of the estate--a negotiation admirably carried
out by the shopkeeper, and which, in fact, was only actually known later
on.

<p/>Despite the low price of each article, Madame Bovary senior, of course,
thought the expenditure extravagant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you do without a carpet? Why have recovered the arm-chairs? In
my time there was a single arm-chair in a house, for elderly persons--at
any rate it was so at my mother's, who was a good woman, I can tell you.
Everybody can't be rich! No fortune can hold out against waste! I should
be ashamed to coddle myself as you do! And yet I am old. I need looking
after. And there! there! fitting up gowns! fallals! What! silk for
lining at two francs, when you can get jaconet for ten sous, or even for
eight, that would do well enough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma, lying on a lounge, replied as quietly as possible--<div class="bookquote">``Ah! Madame,
enough! enough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>The other went on lecturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), predicting they would end in the
workhouse. But it was Bovary's fault. Luckily he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) had promised to destroy
that power of attorney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) swore he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>went on the good woman.

<p/>Emma opened the window, called Charles, and the poor fellow was obliged
to confess the promise torn from him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Emma disappeared, then came back quickly, and majestically handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a
thick piece of paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw the power of attorney
into the fire.

<p/>Emma began to laugh, a strident, piercing, continuous laugh; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had an
attack of hysterics.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>cried Charles. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! you really are wrong! You come here
and make scenes with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother, shrugging her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulders, declared it was <div class="bookquote">``all put on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>But Charles, rebelling for the first time, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife's part, so that
Madame Bovary, senior, said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went the very next day,
and on the threshold, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was trying to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) replied--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! You love her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) better than me, and you are right. It is natural.
For the rest, so much the worse! You will see. Good day--for I am not
likely to come soon again, as you say, to make scenes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles nevertheless was very crestfallen before Emma, who did not hide
the resentment she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) still felt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) want of confidence, and it needed
many prayers before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would consent to have another power of attorney.
He (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) even accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to Monsieur Guillaumin to have a second one,
just like the other, drawn up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the notary; <div class="bookquote">``a man of science can't be worried with
the practical details of life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>And Charles felt relieved by this comfortable reflection, which gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
weakness the flattering appearance of higher pre-occupation.

<p/>And what an outburst the next Thursday at the hotel in their room with
Leon! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) laughed, cried, sang, sent for sherbets, wanted to smoke
cigarettes, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) wild and extravagant, but adorable, superb.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) did not know what recreation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whole being drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more and
more to plunge into the pleasures of life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was becoming irritable,
greedy, voluptuous; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked about the streets with him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) carrying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head high, without fear, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, of compromising herself.
At times, however, Emma shuddered at the sudden thought of meeting
Rodolphe, for it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that, although they were separated
forever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not completely free from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) subjugation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>).

<p/>One night she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not return to Yonville at all. Charles lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head
with anxiety, and little Berthe would not go to bed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mamma,
and sobbed enough to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart. Justin had gone out searching the
road at random. Monsieur Homais even had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) pharmacy.

<p/>At last, at eleven o’clock, able to bear it no longer, Charles
harnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) chaise, jumped in, whipped up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) horse, and reached the
<div class="bookquote">``Croix-Rouge''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>about two o’clock in the morning. No one there! He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought
that the clerk had perhaps seen her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>); but where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) live? Happily,
Charles remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) employer's address, and rushed off there.

<p/>Day was breaking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could distinguish the escutcheons over the
door, and knocked. Someone, without opening the door, shouted out the
required information, adding a few insults to those who disturb people
in the middle of the night.

<p/>The house inhabited by the clerk had neither bell, knocker, nor porter.
Charles knocked loudly at the shutters with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands. A policeman
happened to pass by. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was frightened, and went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``no doubt they kept her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to dinner at Monsieur
Lormeaux'.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But the Lormeaux no longer lived at Rouen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) probably stayed to look after Madame Dubreuil. Why, Madame Dubreuil
has been dead these ten months! Where can she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>An idea occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). At a cafe he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked for a Directory, and
hurriedly looked for the name of Mademoiselle Lempereur, who lived at
No. 74 Rue de la Renelle-des-Maroquiniers.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was turning into the street, Emma herself appeared at the other
end of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) threw himself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rather than embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), crying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What kept you yesterday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it? Where? How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forehead and answered, <div class="bookquote">``At Mademoiselle
Lempereur's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sure of it! I was going there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it isn't worth while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went out just now; but for
the future don't worry. I do not feel free, you see, if I know that the
least delay upsets you like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a sort of permission that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave herself, so as to get
perfect freedom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) escapades. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) profited by it freely, fully.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was seized with the desire to see Leon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) set out upon any
pretext; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was not expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) on that day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to fetch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) office.

<p/>It was a great delight at first, but soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) no longer concealed the
truth, which was, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) master complained very much about these
interruptions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw! come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) slipped out.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) to dress all in black, and grow a pointed beard, to
look like the portraits of Louis XIII. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) lodgings;
thought them poor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) blushed at them, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not notice this, then
advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) to buy some curtains like hers, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) objected to the
expense--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! ah! you care for your money,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said laughing.

<p/>Each time Leon had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had done since their
last meeting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) for some verses--some verses <div class="bookquote">``for herself,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>a <div class="bookquote">``love poem''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in honour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) never succeeded in getting a
rhyme for the second verse; and at last ended by copying a sonnet in
a <div class="bookquote">``Keepsake.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This was less from vanity than from the one desire of
pleasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) did not question her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ideas; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) accepted all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tastes;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was rather becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mistress than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had tender words
and kisses that thrilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) soul. Where could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) have learnt this
corruption almost incorporeal in the strength of its profanity and
dissimulation?



<p/>Chapter Six

<p/>During the journeys he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) made to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), Leon had often dined at the
chemist's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) felt obliged from politeness to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) in turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>Monsieur Homais replied; <div class="bookquote">``besides, I must invigorate
my mind, for I am getting rusty here. We'll go to the theatre, to the
restaurant; we'll make a night of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Homais</b></font>)</div>tenderly murmured Madame Homais, alarmed at the vague
perils he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was preparing to brave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what? Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living
here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy? But there! that is
the way with women! They are jealous of science, and then are opposed to
our taking the most legitimate distractions. No matter! Count upon
me. One of these days I shall turn up at Rouen, and we'll go the pace
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>The druggist would formerly have taken good care not to use such an
expression, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was cultivating a gay Parisian style, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
thought in the best taste; and, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) neighbour, Madame Bovary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
questioned the clerk curiously about the customs of the capital; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
even talked slang to dazzle the bourgeois, saying bender, crummy, dandy,
macaroni, the cheese, cut my stick and <div class="bookquote">``I'll hook it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bourgeois</b></font>)</div>for <div class="bookquote">``I am going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bourgeois</b></font>)</div><p/>So one Thursday Emma was surprised to meet Monsieur Homais in the
kitchen of the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>wearing a traveller's costume, that is to
say, wrapped in an old cloak which no one knew he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had, while he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) carried
a valise in one hand and the foot-warmer of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) establishment in the
other. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had confided his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) intentions to no one, for fear of causing the
public anxiety by his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) absence.

<p/>The idea of seeing again the place where his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) youth had been spent no
doubt excited him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), for during the whole journey he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) never ceased talking,
and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) jumped quickly out of the diligence
to go in search of Leon. In vain the clerk tried to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>).
Monsieur Homais dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) off to the large Cafe de la Normandie,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) entered majestically, not raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) hat, thinking it very
provincial to uncover in any public place.

<p/>Emma waited for Leon three quarters of an hour. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ran to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) office; and, lost in all sorts of conjectures, accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) of
indifference, and reproaching herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) weakness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spent the
afternoon, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face pressed against the window-panes.

<p/>At two o’clock they were still at a table opposite each other. The large
room was emptying; the stove-pipe, in the shape of a palm-tree, spread
its gilt leaves over the white ceiling, and near them, outside the
window, in the bright sunshine, a little fountain gurgled in a white
basin, where; in the midst of watercress and asparagus, three torpid
lobsters stretched across to some quails that lay heaped up in a pile on
their sides.

<p/>Homais was enjoying himself. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was even more intoxicated with
the luxury than the rich fare, the Pommard wine all the same rather
excited his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) faculties; and when the omelette au rhum* appeared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began
propounding immoral theories about women. What seduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) above all
else was chic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) admired an elegant toilette in a well-furnished
apartment, and as to bodily qualities, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) didn't dislike a young girl.

<p/>* In rum.


<p/>Leon watched the clock in despair. The druggist went on drinking,
eating, and talking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be very lonely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) said suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``here at Rouen. To be sure
your lady-love doesn't live far away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And the other blushed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now, be frank. Can you deny that at Yonville--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man stammered something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At Madame Bovary's, you're not making love to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The servant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not joking; but vanity getting the better of all prudence, Leon,
in spite of himself protested. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) only liked dark women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I approve of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist; <div class="bookquote">``they have more passion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>And whispering into his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) friend's ear, he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) pointed out the symptoms by
which one could find out if a woman had passion. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) even launched into
an ethnographic digression: the German was vapourish, the French woman
licentious, the Italian passionate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And negresses?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>asked the clerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are an artistic taste!''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said Homais. <div class="bookquote">``Waiter! two cups of coffee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div>at last asked Leon impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ja!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But before leaving he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) wanted to see the proprietor of the establishment
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) a few compliments. Then the young man, to be alone, alleged
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some business engagement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I will escort you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said Homais.

<p/>And all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was walking through the streets with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children; of their future, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business; told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in what a decayed condition it had formerly been, and to what a
degree of perfection he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had raised it.

<p/>Arrived in front of the Hotel de Boulogne, Leon left him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) abruptly, ran
up the stairs, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mistress in great excitement. At mention of
the chemist she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) flew into a passion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), however, piled up good reasons;
it wasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) fault; didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) know Homais--did she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
would prefer his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) company? But she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) turned away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) back, and,
sinking on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) knees, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) waist with his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) arms in a languorous
pose, full of concupiscence and supplication.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was standing up, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) large flashing eyes looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) seriously,
almost terribly. Then tears obscured them, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) red eyelids were lowered,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hands, and Leon was pressing them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) lips when a
servant appeared to tell the gentleman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will come back?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a trick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist, when he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) saw Leon. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to
interrupt this visit, that seemed to me to annoy you. Let's go and have
a glass of garus at Bridoux'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leon/Monsieur Leon/Monsieur Leon Dupuis</b></font>)</div><p/>Leon vowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) must get back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) office. Then the druggist joked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) about quill-drivers and the law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave Cujas and Barthole alone a bit. Who the devil prevents you? Be a
man! Let's go to Bridoux'. You'll see his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) dog. It's very interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>And as the clerk still insisted--

<p/>``I'll go with you. I'll read a paper while I wait for you, or turn over
the leaves of a `Code.'''

<p/>Leon, bewildered by Emma's anger, Monsieur Homais' chatter, and,
perhaps, by the heaviness of the luncheon, was undecided, and, as it
were, fascinated by the chemist, who kept repeating--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go to Bridoux'. It's just by here, in the Rue Malpalu.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, through cowardice, through stupidity, through that indefinable
feeling that drags us into the most distasteful acts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) allowed
himself to be led off to Bridoux', whom they found in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) small yard,
superintending three workmen, who panted as they turned the large
wheel of a machine for making seltzer-water. Homais gave them some good
advice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) embraced Bridoux; they took some garus. Twenty times Leon
tried to escape, but the other seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) by the arm saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Presently! I'm coming! We'll go to the `Fanal de Rouen' to see the
fellows there. I'll introduce you to Thornassin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) managed to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), and rushed straight to the hotel.
Emma was no longer there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had just gone in a fit of anger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
detested him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) now. This failing to keep their rendezvous seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) an
insult, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to rake up other reasons to separate herself from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was incapable of heroism, weak, banal, more spiritless than a
woman, avaricious too, and cowardly.

<p/>Then, growing calmer, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at length discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had, no doubt,
calumniated him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>). But the disparaging of those we love always alienates
us from them to some extent. We must not touch our idols; the gilt
sticks to our fingers.

<p/>They gradually came to talking more frequently of matters outside their
love, and in the letters that Emma wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke of flowers,
verses, the moon and the stars, naive resources of a waning passion
striving to keep itself alive by all external aids. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was constantly
promising herself a profound felicity on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) next journey. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) confessed to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt nothing extraordinary. This
disappointment quickly gave way to a new hope, and Emma returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
more inflamed, more eager than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) undressed brutally, tearing off
the thin laces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) corset that nestled around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hips like a gliding
snake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on tiptoe, barefooted, to see once more that the
door was closed, then, pale, serious, and, without speaking, with one
movement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw herself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) breast with a long shudder.

<p/>Yet there was upon that brow covered with cold drops, on those quivering
lips, in those wild eyes, in the strain of those arms, something vague
and dreary that seemed to Leon to glide between them subtly as if to
separate them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) did not dare to question her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so skilled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must
have passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) thought, through every experience of suffering and of
pleasure. What had once charmed now frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) a little. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
rebelled against his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) absorption, daily more marked, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) personality.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) begrudged Emma this constant victory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) even strove not to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>);
then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) heard the creaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) boots, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) turned coward, like
drunkards at the sight of strong drinks.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not fail, in truth, to lavish all sorts of attentions upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>),
from the delicacies of food to the coquettries of dress and languishing
looks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brought roses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breast from Yonville, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) face; was anxious about his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) health, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) advice as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
conduct; and, in order the more surely to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hold on him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), hoping
perhaps that heaven would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) part, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tied a medal of the
Virgin round his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) inquired like a virtuous mother about his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
companions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't see them; don't go out; think only of ourselves; love me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have liked to be able to watch over his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) life; and the idea
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of having him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) followed in the streets. Near the hotel
there was always a kind of loafer who accosted travellers, and who would
not refuse. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pride revolted at this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! so much the worse. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) deceive me! What does it matter to me?
As If I cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>One day, when they had parted early and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was returning alone along
the boulevard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the walls of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convent; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat down on a
form in the shade of the elm-trees. How calm that time had been! How she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
longed for the ineffable sentiments of love that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had tried to figure
to herself out of books! The first month of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) marriage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rides in
the wood, the viscount that waltzed, and Lagardy singing, all repassed
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes. And Leon suddenly appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as far off as the
others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet I love him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to herself.

<p/>No matter! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not happy--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) never had been. Whence came this
insufficiency in life--this instantaneous turning to decay of everything
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leant? But if there were somewhere a being strong and
beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement,
a poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing
out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not find
him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)? Ah! how impossible! Besides, nothing was worth the trouble of
seeking it; everything was a lie. Every smile hid a yawn of boredom,
every joy a curse, all pleasure satiety, and the sweetest kisses left
upon your lips only the unattainable desire for a greater delight.

<p/>A metallic clang droned through the air, and four strokes were heard
from the convent-clock. Four o’clock! And it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
been there on that form an eternity. But an infinity of passions may be
contained in a minute, like a crowd in a small space.

<p/>Emma lived all absorbed in hers, and troubled no more about money
matters than an archduchess.

<p/>Once, however, a wretched-looking man, rubicund and bald, came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
house, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been sent by Monsieur Vincart of Rouen. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took out
the pins that held together the side-pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long green overcoat,
stuck them into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeve, and politely handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a paper.

<p/>It was a bill for seven hundred francs, signed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and which
Lheureux, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) professions, had paid away to Vincart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) servant for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not come. Then the stranger, who
had remained standing, casting right and left curious glances, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thick, fair eyebrows hid, asked with a naive air--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What answer am I to take Monsieur Vincart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``tell him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) that I haven't it. I will send next week; he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)
must wait; yes, till next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>And the fellow went without another word.

<p/>But the next day at twelve o’clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) received a summons, and the sight
of the stamped paper, on which appeared several times in large letters,
<div class="bookquote">``Maitre Hareng, bailiff at Buchy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>so frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rushed in
hot haste to the linendraper's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shop, doing up a
parcel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your obedient!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I am at your service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lheureux, all the same, went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) work, helped by a young
girl of about thirteen, somewhat hunch-backed, who was at once his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) clerk
and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) servant.

<p/>Then, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) clogs clattering on the shop-boards, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went up in front
of Madame Bovary to the first door, and introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) into a narrow
closet, where, in a large bureau in sapon-wood, lay some ledgers,
protected by a horizontal padlocked iron bar. Against the wall, under
some remnants of calico, one glimpsed a safe, but of such dimensions
that it must contain something besides bills and money. Monsieur
Lheureux, in fact, went in for pawnbroking, and it was there that he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) had
put Madame Bovary's gold chain, together with the earrings of poor old
Tellier, who, at last forced to sell out, had bought a meagre store
of grocery at Quincampoix, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) was dying of catarrh amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>)
candles, that were less yellow than his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) face.

<p/>Lheureux sat down in a large cane arm-chair, saying: <div class="bookquote">``What news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well how can I help it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) grew angry, reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) of the promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) had given not to
pay away her (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) bills. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) acknowledged it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I was pressed myself; the knife was at my own throat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will happen now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's very simple; a judgment and then a distraint--that's about
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma kept down a desire to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>), and asked gently if there was no
way of quieting Monsieur Vincart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say! Quiet Vincart! You don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>)'s more ferocious than
an Arab!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div><p/>Still Monsieur Lheureux must interfere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, listen. It seems to me so far I've been very good to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And
opening one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) ledgers, <div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) said. Then running up the page
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) finger, <div class="bookquote">``Let's see! let's see! August 3d, two hundred francs;
June 17th, a hundred and fifty; March 23d, forty-six. In April--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) stopped, as if afraid of making some mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to speak of the bills signed by Monsieur Bovary, one for seven
hundred francs, and another for three hundred. As to your little
installments, with the interest, why, there's no end to `em; one gets
quite muddled over `em. I'll have nothing more to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wept; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even called him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) good Monsieur Lheureux.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>)
always fell back upon <div class="bookquote">``that rascal Vincart.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) hadn't a brass
farthing; no one was paying him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) now-a-days; they were eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) coat
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) back; a poor shopkeeper like him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) couldn't advance money.

<p/>Emma was silent, and Monsieur Lheureux, who was biting the feathers of a
quill, no doubt became uneasy at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) silence, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellier</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless one of these days I have something coming in, I might--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as soon as the balance of Barneville--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And on hearing that Langlois had not yet paid he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) seemed much surprised.
Then in a honied voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we agree, you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! to anything you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On this he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) eyes to reflect, wrote down a few figures, and
declaring it would be very difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>), that the affair was shady,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) was being bled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) wrote out four bills for two hundred and
fifty francs each, to fall due month by month.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Provided that Vincart will listen to me! However, it's settled. I don't
play the fool; I'm straight enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Next he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) carelessly showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) several new goods, not one of which,
however, was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) opinion worthy of madame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I think that there's a dress at threepence-halfpenny a yard, and
warranted fast colours! And yet they actually swallow it! Of course you
understand one doesn't tell them what it really is!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) hoped by this
confession of dishonesty to others to quite convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) probity
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) three yards of guipure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Langlois</b></font>) had
lately picked up <div class="bookquote">``at a sale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it lovely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>said Lheureux. <div class="bookquote">``It is very much used now for the
backs of arm-chairs. It's quite the rage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a juggler</b></font>)</div><p/>And, more ready than a juggler, he (<font color='blue'><b>juggler</b></font>) wrapped up the guipure in some blue
paper and put it in Emma's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But at least let me know--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, another time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>juggler</b></font>) replied, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>juggler</b></font>) heel.

<p/>That same evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) urged Bovary to write to his (<font color='blue'><b>juggler</b></font>) mother, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
to send as quickly as possible the whole of the balance due from the
father's estate. The mother-in-law replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) had nothing more,
the winding up was over, and there was due to them besides Barneville an
income of six hundred francs, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) would pay them punctually.

<p/>Then Madame Bovary sent in accounts to two or three patients, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)
made large use of this method, which was very successful. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) was always
careful to add a postscript: <div class="bookquote">``Do not mention this to my husband; you
know how proud he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is. Excuse me. Yours obediently.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>There were some
complaints; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) intercepted them.

<p/>To get money she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) began selling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) old gloves, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) old hats, the old
odds and ends, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) bargained rapaciously, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) peasant blood standing
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) in good stead. Then on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) journey to town she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) picked up nick-nacks
secondhand, that, in default of anyone else, Monsieur Lheureux would
certainly take off her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) bought ostrich feathers, Chinese
porcelain, and trunks; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) borrowed from Felicite, from Madame
Lefrancois, from the landlady at the Croix-Rouge, from everybody, no
matter where.

<p/>With the money she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) at last received from Barneville she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) paid two bills;
the other fifteen hundred francs fell due. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) renewed the bills, and
thus it was continually.

<p/>Sometimes, it is true, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) tried to make a calculation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)
discovered things so exorbitant that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) could not believe them
possible. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) recommenced, soon got confused, gave it all up, and
thought no more about it.

<p/>The house was very dreary now. Tradesmen were seen leaving it with angry
faces. Handkerchiefs were lying about on the stoves, and little Berthe,
to the great scandal of Madame Homais, wore stockings with holes in
them. If Charles timidly ventured a remark, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) answered roughly that it
wasn't her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) fault.

<p/>What was the meaning of all these fits of temper? He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) explained
everything through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) old nervous illness, and reproaching himself with
having taken her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) infirmities for faults, accused himself of egotism, and
longed to go and take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said to himself; <div class="bookquote">``I should worry her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not stir.

<p/>After dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) walked about alone in the garden; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took little Berthe
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knees, and unfolding his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) medical journal, tried to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)
to read. But the child, who never had any lessons, soon looked up with
large, sad eyes and began to cry. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>); went to fetch
water in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) can to make rivers on the sand path, or broke off branches
from the privet hedges to plant trees in the beds. This did not spoil
the garden much, all choked now with long weeds. They owed Lestiboudois
for so many days. Then the child grew cold and asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call the servant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``You know, dearie, that mamma does not
like to be disturbed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Autumn was setting in, and the leaves were already falling, as they did
two years ago when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) was ill. Where would it all end? And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) walked up
and down, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back.

<p/>Madame was in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) room, which no one entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) stayed there all
day long, torpid, half dressed, and from time to time burning Turkish
pastilles which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) had bought at Rouen in an Algerian's shop. In order
not to have at night this sleeping man stretched at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) side, by dint of
manoeuvring, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) at last succeeded in banishing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the second floor,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) read till morning extravagant books, full of pictures of
orgies and thrilling situations. Often, seized with fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) cried out,
and Charles hurried to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) would say.

<p/>Or at other times, consumed more ardently than ever by that inner flame
to which adultery added fuel, panting, tremulous, all desire, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) threw
open her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) window, breathed in the cold air, shook loose in the wind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)
masses of hair, too heavy, and, gazing upon the stars, longed for some
princely love. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), of Leon. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) would then have given
anything for a single one of those meetings that surfeited her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>).

<p/>These were her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) gala days. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) wanted them to be sumptuous, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
alone could not pay the expenses, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) made up the deficit liberally,
which happened pretty well every time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) tried to make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) understand
that they would be quite as comfortable somewhere else, in a smaller
hotel, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) always found some objection.

<p/>One day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) drew six small silver-gilt spoons from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) bag -LRB-they were
old Roualt's wedding present-RRB-, begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) to pawn them at once for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>),
and Leon obeyed, though the proceeding annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was afraid of
compromising himself.

<p/>Then, on, reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) began to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mistress's ways were growing
odd, and that they were perhaps not wrong in wishing to separate him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).

<p/>In fact someone had sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mother a long anonymous letter to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``ruining himself with a married woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the good lady at
once conjuring up the eternal bugbear of families, the vague pernicious
creature, the siren, the monster, who dwells fantastically in depths of
love, wrote to Lawyer Dubocage, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) employer, who behaved perfectly in
the affair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) for three quarters of an hour trying to open
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) eyes, to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) of the abyss into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) was falling. Such
an intrigue would damage him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) later on, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) set up for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>)
implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) to break with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) would not make this sacrifice
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) own interest, to do it at least for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>), Dubocage's sake.

<p/>At last Leon swore he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) would not see Emma again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) reproached
himself with not having kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) word, considering all the worry and
lectures this woman might still draw down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), without reckoning
the jokes made by his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) companions as they sat round the stove in the
morning. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was soon to be head clerk; it was time to settle
down. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) flute, exalted sentiments, and poetry; for every
bourgeois in the flush of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) youth, were it but for a day, a moment,
has believed himself capable of immense passions, of lofty enterprises.
The most mediocre libertine has dreamed of sultanas; every notary bears
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) the debris of a poet.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was bored now when Emma suddenly began to sob on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) breast, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
heart, like the people who can only stand a certain amount of music,
dozed to the sound of a love whose delicacies he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) no longer noted.

<p/>They knew one another too well for any of those surprises of possession
that increase its joys a hundred-fold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was as sick of him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
was weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Emma found again in adultery all the platitudes of
marriage.

<p/>But how to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)? Then, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might feel humiliated at
the baseness of such enjoyment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) clung to it from habit or from
corruption, and each day she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hungered after them the more, exhausting
all felicity in wishing for too much of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) accused Leon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
baffled hopes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even longed for some
catastrophe that would bring about their separation, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not
the courage to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind to it herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) none the less went on writing him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) love letters, in virtue of the
notion that a woman must write to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover.

<p/>But whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrote it was another man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw, a phantom fashioned out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) most ardent memories, of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finest reading, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strongest
lusts, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became so real, so tangible, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) palpitated
wondering, without, however, the power to imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clearly, so lost
was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), like a god, beneath the abundance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attributes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dwelt in
that azure land where silk ladders hang from balconies under the breath
of flowers, in the light of the moon. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
coming, and would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right away in a kiss.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell back exhausted, for these transports of vague love wearied
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more than great debauchery.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now felt constant ache all over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Often she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) even received
summonses, stamped paper that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) barely looked at. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have liked
not to be alive, or to be always asleep.

<p/>On Mid-Lent she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not return to Yonville, but in the evening went to
a masked ball. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore velvet breeches, red stockings, a club wig, and
three-cornered hat cocked on one side. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) danced all night to the wild
tones of the trombones; people gathered round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and in the morning
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found herself on the steps of the theatre together with five or six
masks, debardeuses* and sailors, Leon's comrades, who were talking about
having supper.

<p/>* People dressed as longshoremen.


<p/>The neighbouring cafes were full. They caught sight of one on the
harbour, a very indifferent restaurant, whose proprietor showed them to
a little room on the fourth floor.

<p/>The men were whispering in a corner, no doubt consorting about expenses.
There were a clerk, two medical students, and a shopman--what company
for her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)! As to the women, Emma soon perceived from the tone of their
voices that they must almost belong to the lowest class. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
frightened, pushed back her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chair, and cast down her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>The others began to eat; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ate nothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head was on fire, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes
smarted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) skin was ice-cold. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to feel the
floor of the ball-room rebounding again beneath the rhythmical pulsation
of the thousands of dancing feet. And now the smell of the punch, the
smoke of the cigars, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) giddy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fainted, and they carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
to the window.

<p/>Day was breaking, and a great stain of purple colour broadened out
in the pale horizon over the St. Catherine hills. The livid river was
shivering in the wind; there was no one on the bridges; the street lamps
were going out.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) revived, and began thinking of Berthe asleep yonder in the servant's
room. Then a cart filled with long strips of iron passed by, and made a
deafening metallic vibration against the walls of the houses.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) slipped away suddenly, threw off her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) costume, told Leon she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must get
back, and at last was alone at the Hotel de Boulogne. Everything, even
herself, was now unbearable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wished that, taking wing like a
bird, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could fly somewhere, far away to regions of purity, and there
grow young again.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went out, crossed the Boulevard, the Place Cauchoise, and the
Faubourg, as far as an open street that overlooked some gardens. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
walked rapidly; the fresh air calming her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and, little by little, the
faces of the crowd, the masks, the quadrilles, the lights, the supper,
those women, all disappeared like mists fading away. Then, reaching the
<div class="bookquote">``Croix-Rouge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) threw herself on the bed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) little room on the
second floor, where there were pictures of the <div class="bookquote">``Tour de Nesle.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At four
o’clock Hivert awoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got home, Felicite showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) behind the clock a grey paper.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) read--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In virtue of the seizure in execution of a judgment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>What judgment? As a matter of fact, the evening before another paper
had been brought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not yet seen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was stunned by these
words--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By order of the king, law, and justice, to Madame Bovary.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then,
skipping several lines, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) read, <div class="bookquote">``Within twenty-four hours, without
fail--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But what? <div class="bookquote">``To pay the sum of eight thousand francs.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And there
was even at the bottom, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be constrained thereto by every
form of law, and notably by a writ of distraint on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) furniture and
effects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>What was to be done? In twenty-four hours--tomorrow. Lheureux, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
thought, wanted to frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw through all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hivert</b></font>)
devices, the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hivert</b></font>) kindnesses. What reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was the very
magnitude of the sum.

<p/>However, by dint of buying and not paying, of borrowing, signing bills,
and renewing these bills that grew at each new falling-in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had ended
by preparing a capital for Monsieur Lheureux which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hivert</b></font>) was impatiently
awaiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hivert</b></font>) speculations.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) presented herself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hivert</b></font>) place with an offhand air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what has happened to me? No doubt it's a joke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hivert</b></font>) turned away slowly, and, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Hivert</b></font>) arms, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My good lady, did you think I should go on to all eternity being your
purveyor and banker, for the love of God? Now be just. I must get back
what I've laid out. Now be just.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried out against the debt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! so much the worse. The court has admitted it. There's a judgment.
It's been notified to you. Besides, it isn't my fault. It's Vincart's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you not--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing whatever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But still, now talk it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began beating about the bush; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had known nothing about it; it
was a surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose fault is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>said Lheureux, bowing ironically. <div class="bookquote">``While I'm
slaving like a nigger, you go gallivanting about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! no lecturing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It never does any harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bush</b></font>) replied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned coward; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) implored him (<font color='blue'><b>bush</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) even pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pretty white
and slender hand against the shopkeeper's knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, that'll do! Anyone'd think you wanted to seduce me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh! go it! go it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will show you up. I shall tell my husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right! I too. I'll show your husband something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div><p/>And Lheureux drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) strong box the receipt for eighteen hundred
francs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) when Vincart had discounted the bills.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll not understand your little theft,
the poor dear man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) collapsed, more overcome than if felled by the blow of a pole-axe.
He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) was walking up and down from the window to the bureau, repeating all
the while--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I'll show him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! I'll show him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and in a
soft voice said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't pleasant, I know; but, after all, no bones are broken, and,
since that is the only way that is left for you paying back my money--''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where am I to get any?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Emma, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! when one has friends like you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in so keen, so terrible a fashion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
shuddered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) very heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I promise you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to sign--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've enough of your signatures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will sell something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) said, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) shoulders; <div class="bookquote">``you've not got
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) called through the peep-hole that looked down into the shop--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annette, don't forget the three coupons of No. 14.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The servant appeared. Emma understood, and asked how much money would be
wanted to put a stop to the proceedings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I brought you several thousand francs--a quarter of the sum--a
third--perhaps the whole?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it's no use!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gently towards the staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I implore you, Monsieur Lheureux, just a few days more!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! tears now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are driving me to despair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I care?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), shutting the door.



<p/>Chapter Seven

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was stoical the next day when Maitre Hareng, the bailiff, with two
assistants, presented himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) house to draw up the inventory for
the distraint.

<p/>They began with Bovary's consulting-room, and did not write down
the phrenological head, which was considered an <div class="bookquote">``instrument of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
profession'' (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>; but in the kitchen they counted the plates; the saucepans,
the chairs, the candlesticks, and in the bedroom all the nick-nacks on
the whatnot. They examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dresses, the linen, the dressing-room;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whole existence to its most intimate details, was, like a corpse
on whom a post-mortem is made, outspread before the eyes of these three
men.

<p/>Maitre Hareng, buttoned up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareng</b></font>) thin black coat, wearing a white
choker and very tight foot-straps, repeated from time to time--<div class="bookquote">``Allow
me, madame. You allow me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maitre Hareng</b></font>)</div>Often he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareng</b></font>) uttered exclamations. <div class="bookquote">``Charming!
very pretty.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareng</b></font>) began writing again, dipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareng</b></font>) pen into the horn
inkstand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareng</b></font>) left hand.

<p/>When they had done with the rooms they went up to the attic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) kept a
desk there in which Rodolphe's letters were locked. It had to be opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! a correspondence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maitre Hareng</b></font>)</div>said Maitre Hareng, with a discreet smile. <div class="bookquote">``But
allow me, for I must make sure the box contains nothing else.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareng</b></font>)
tipped up the papers lightly, as if to shake out napoleons. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
grew angered to see this coarse hand, with fingers red and pulpy like
slugs, touching these pages against which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart had beaten.

<p/>They went at last. Felicite came back. Emma had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out to watch
for Bovary in order to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareng</b></font>) off, and they hurriedly installed the
man in possession under the roof, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would remain.

<p/>During the evening Charles seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) careworn. Emma watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with
a look of anguish, fancying she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw an accusation in every line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
face. Then, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes wandered over the chimney-piece ornamented
with Chinese screens, over the large curtains, the armchairs, all
those things, in a word, that had, softened the bitterness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life,
remorse seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) or rather an immense regret, that, far from crushing,
irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) passion. Charles placidly poked the fire, both his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feet on
the fire-dogs.

<p/>Once the man, no doubt bored in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hiding-place, made a slight noise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is anyone walking upstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``it is a window that has been left open, and is
rattling in the wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day, Sunday, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to Rouen to call on all the brokers whose
names she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew. They were at their country-places or on journeys. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was not discouraged; and those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did manage to see she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked for
money, declaring she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must have some, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would pay it back.
Some laughed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face; all refused.

<p/>At two o’clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hurried to Leon, and knocked at the door. No one
answered. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What brings you here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I disturb you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) admitted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) landlord didn't like his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) having
<div class="bookquote">``women''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) took down the key, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! Down there, in our home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And they went to their room at the Hotel de Boulogne.

<p/>On arriving she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drank off a large glass of water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was very pale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leon, you will do me a service?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) by both hands that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grasped tightly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, I want eight thousand francs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are mad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And thereupon, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) the story of the distraint, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) explained
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) distress to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>); for Charles knew nothing of it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother-in-law
detested her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); old Rouault could do nothing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>), Leon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) would set
about finding this indispensable sum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How on earth can I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a coward you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) said stupidly, <div class="bookquote">``You are exaggerating the difficulty. Perhaps,
with a thousand crowns or so the fellow could be stopped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All the greater reason to try and do something; it was impossible that
they could not find three thousand francs. Besides, Leon, could be
security instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, try, try! I will love you so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) went out, and came back at the end of an hour, saying, with solemn
face--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been to three people with no success.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they remained sitting face to face at the two chimney corners,
motionless, in silence. Emma shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulders as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) murmuring--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were in your place _I_ should soon get some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At your office.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>).

<p/>An infernal boldness looked out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) burning eyes, and their lids
drew close together with a lascivious and encouraging look, so that the
young man felt himself growing weak beneath the mute will of this woman
who was urging him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a crime. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was afraid, and to avoid any
explanation he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smote his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, crying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Morel is to come back to-night; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) will not refuse me, I hope''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this
was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends, the son of a very rich merchant-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``and I will
bring it you to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>a merchant</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added.

<p/>Emma did not seem to welcome this hope with all the joy he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had expected.
Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspect the lie? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, blushing--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, if you don't see me by three o’clock do not wait for me, my
darling. I must be off now; forgive me! Goodbye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, but it felt quite lifeless. Emma had no strength
left for any sentiment.

<p/>Four o’clock struck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rose to return to Yonville, mechanically
obeying the force of old habits.

<p/>The weather was fine. It was one of those March days, clear and sharp,
when the sun shines in a perfectly white sky. The Rouen folk, in
Sunday-clothes, were walking about with happy looks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reached the
Place du Parvis. People were coming out after vespers; the crowd flowed
out through the three doors like a stream through the three arches of
a bridge, and in the middle one, more motionless than a rock, stood the
beadle.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) remembered the day when, all anxious and full of hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
entered beneath this large nave, that had opened out before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), less
profound than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) love; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked on weeping beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) veil,
giddy, staggering, almost fainting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a voice issuing from the gate of a courtyard that was
thrown open.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped to let pass a black horse, pawing the ground between the
shafts of a tilbury, driven by a gentleman in sable furs. Who was it?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). The carriage darted by and disappeared.

<p/>Why, it was he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)--the Viscount. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned away; the street was empty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was so overwhelmed, so sad, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to lean against a wall to keep
herself from falling.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been mistaken. Anyhow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not know. All
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was abandoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt lost, sinking
at random into indefinable abysses, and it was almost with joy that, on
reaching the <div class="bookquote">``Croix-Rouge,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the good Homais, who was watching
a large box full of pharmaceutical stores being hoisted on to the
<div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) held tied in a silk handkerchief six
cheminots for his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Madame Homais was very fond of these small, heavy turban-shaped loaves,
that are eaten in Lent with salt butter; a last vestige of Gothic food
that goes back, perhaps, to the time of the Crusades, and with which
the robust Normans gorged themselves of yore, fancying they saw on the
table, in the light of the yellow torches, between tankards of hippocras
and huge boars' heads, the heads of Saracens to be devoured. The
druggist's wife crunched them up as they had done--heroically, despite
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wretched teeth. And so whenever Homais journeyed to town, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) never
failed to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) home some that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bought at the great baker's in the
Rue Massacre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charmed to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said, offering Emma a hand to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into the
<div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) cheminots to the cords of the netting,
and remained bare-headed in an attitude pensive and Napoleonic.

<p/>But when the blind man appeared as usual at the foot of the hill he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't understand why the authorities tolerate such culpable
industries. Such unfortunates should be locked up and forced to work.
Progress, my word! creeps at a snail's pace. We are floundering about in
mere barbarism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The blind man held out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, that flapped about at the door, as if it
were a bag in the lining that had come unnailed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist affection</b></font>)</div>said the chemist, <div class="bookquote">``is a scrofulous affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist affection</b></font>)</div><p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) knew the poor devil, he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) pretended to see him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) for the first
time, murmured something about <div class="bookquote">``cornea,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``opaque cornea,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``sclerotic,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``facies,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>then asked him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) in a paternal tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend, have you long had this terrible infirmity? Instead of
getting drunk at the public, you'd do better to die yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) advised him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) to take good wine, good beer, and good joints. The blind
man went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) song; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed, moreover, almost idiotic. At last
Monsieur Homais opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purse--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now there's a sou; give me back two lairds, and don't forget my advice:
you'll be the better for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Hivert openly cast some doubt on the efficacy of it. But the druggist
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would cure himself with an antiphlogistic pomade of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
composition, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address--<div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Homais, near the market,
pretty well known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hivert</b></font>)</div>said Hivert, <div class="bookquote">``for all this trouble you'll give us your
performance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hivert</b></font>)</div><p/>The blind man sank down on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) haunches, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head thrown back,
whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greenish eyes, lolled out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue, and rubbed
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stomach with both hands as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uttered a kind of hollow yell like a
famished dog. Emma, filled with disgust, threw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulder
a five-franc piece. It was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fortune. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) very fine
thus to throw it away.

<p/>The coach had gone on again when suddenly Monsieur Homais leant out
through the window, crying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No farinaceous or milk food, wear wool next the skin, and expose the
diseased parts to the smoke of juniper berries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>The sight of the well-known objects that defiled before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes
gradually diverted Emma from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present trouble. An intolerable fatigue
overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) home stupefied, discouraged, almost
asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come what may come!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``And then, who knows? Why, at
any moment could not some extraordinary event occur? Lheureux even might
die!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At nine o’clock in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was awakened by the sound of voices
in the Place. There was a crowd round the market reading a large bill
fixed to one of the posts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Justin, who was climbing on to
a stone and tearing down the bill. But at this moment the rural guard
seized him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) by the collar. Monsieur Homais came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) shop, and Mere
Lefrangois, in the midst of the crowd, seemed to be perorating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame! madame!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Felicite, running in, <div class="bookquote">``it's abominable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>And the poor girl, deeply moved, handed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a yellow paper that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
just torn off the door. Emma read with a glance that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) furniture
was for sale.

<p/>Then they looked at one another silently. The servant and mistress had
no secret one from the other. At last Felicite sighed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were you, madame, I should go to Monsieur Guillaumin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felicite</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And this question meant to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You who know the house through the servant, has the master spoken
sometimes of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you'd do well to go there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) dressed, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) black gown, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hood with jet beads, and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) might not be seen -LRB-there was still a crowd on the Place-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
took the path by the river, outside the village.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) reached the notary's gate quite breathless. The sky was sombre, and
a little snow was falling. At the sound of the bell, Theodore in a
red waistcoat appeared on the steps; he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) came to open the door almost
familiarly, as to an acquaintance, and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) into the dining-room.

<p/>A large porcelain stove crackled beneath a cactus that filled up the
niche in the wall, and in black wood frames against the oak-stained
paper hung Steuben's <div class="bookquote">``Esmeralda''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and Schopin's <div class="bookquote">``Potiphar.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
ready-laid table, the two silver chafing-dishes, the crystal door-knobs,
the parquet and the furniture, all shone with a scrupulous, English
cleanliness; the windows were ornamented at each corner with stained
glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>thought Emma, <div class="bookquote">``is the dining-room I ought to have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>The notary came in pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) palm-leaf dressing-gown to his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) breast
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) left arm, while with the other hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) raised and quickly put
on again his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) brown velvet cap, pretentiously cocked on the right side,
whence looked out the ends of three fair curls drawn from the back of
the head, following the line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) bald skull.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) had offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a seat he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) sat down to breakfast, apologising
profusely for his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) rudeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to beg you, sir--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, madame? I am listening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began explaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) position to him (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>). Monsieur Guillaumin knew
it, being secretly associated with the linendraper, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) always
got capital for the loans on mortgages that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) was asked to make.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) knew -LRB-and better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) herself-RRB- the long story of the bills,
small at first, bearing different names as endorsers, made out at long
dates, and constantly renewed up to the day, when, gathering together
all the protested bills, the shopkeeper had bidden his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) friend Vincart
take in his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) own name all the necessary proceedings, not wishing to pass
for a tiger with his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) fellow-citizens.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mingled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) story with recriminations against Lheureux, to which the
notary replied from time to time with some insignificant word. Eating
his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) cutlet and drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) buried his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) chin in his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) sky-blue
cravat, into which were thrust two diamond pins, held together by a
small gold chain; and he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) smiled a singular smile, in a sugary, ambiguous
fashion. But noticing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feet were damp, he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do get closer to the stove; put your feet up against the porcelain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was afraid of dirtying it. The notary replied in a gallant tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful things spoil nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to move him (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>), and, growing moved herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) about the poorness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) home, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) worries, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wants.
He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) could understand that; an elegant woman! and, without leaving off
eating, he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) had turned completely round towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), so that his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) knee
brushed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) boot, whose sole curled round as it smoked against
the stove.

<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked for a thousand sous, he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) lips, and declared
he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) was very sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) had not had the management of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fortune before,
for there were hundreds of ways very convenient, even for a lady, of
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) money to account. They might, either in the turf-peats
of Grumesnil or building-ground at Havre, almost without risk, have
ventured on some excellent speculations; and he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) consume herself
with rage at the thought of the fabulous sums that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would certainly
have made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that you didn't come to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, hey? Did I frighten you so much? It is I, on the contrary, who
ought to complain. We hardly know one another; yet I am very devoted to
you. You do not doubt that, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) hand, took hers, covered it with a greedy kiss, then
held it on his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) knee; and he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) played delicately with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers whilst
he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) murmured a thousand blandishments. His (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) insipid voice murmured like a
running brook; a light shone in his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) eyes through the glimmering of his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>)
spectacles, and his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) hand was advancing up Emma's sleeve to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheek his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) panting breath. This man oppressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) horribly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sprang up and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I am waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For what?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the notary, who suddenly became very pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Then, yielding to the outburst of too powerful a desire, <div class="bookquote">``Well,
yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) dragged himself towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) knees, regardless of his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>)
dressing-gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For pity's sake, stay. I love you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) waist. Madame Bovary's face flushed purple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
recoiled with a terrible look, crying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are taking a shameless advantage of my distress, sir! I am to be
pitied--not to be sold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went out.

<p/>The notary remained quite stupefied, his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) eyes fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) fine
embroidered slippers. They were a love gift, and the sight of them at
last consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>). Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) reflected that such an adventure might
have carried him (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) too far.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a wretch! what a scoundrel! what an infamy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said to herself,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fled with nervous steps beneath the aspens of the path. The
disappointment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) failure increased the indignation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) outraged
modesty; it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that Providence pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) implacably, and,
strengthening herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pride, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never felt so much esteem
for herself nor so much contempt for others. A spirit of warfare
transformed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have liked to strike all men, to spit in
their faces, to crush them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked rapidly straight on, pale,
quivering, maddened, searching the empty horizon with tear-dimmed eyes,
and as it were rejoicing in the hate that was choking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) house a numbness came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not go on;
and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must. Besides, whither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) flee?

<p/>Felicite was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/>And for a quarter of an hour the two of them went over the various
persons in Yonville who might perhaps be inclined to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). But each
time that Felicite named someone Emma replied--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible! they will not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the master'll soon be in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that well enough. Leave me alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had tried everything; there was nothing more to be done now; and
when Charles came in she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away! This carpet on which you are walking is no longer ours. In
your own house you do not possess a chair, a pin, a straw, and it is I,
poor man, who have ruined you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there would be a great sob; next he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would weep abundantly, and at
last, the surprise past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) murmured, grinding her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will forgive me, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who
would give a million if I would forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for having known me! Never!
never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This thought of Bovary's superiority to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Then,
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) confessed or did not confess, presently, immediately,
to-morrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would know the catastrophe all the same; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must wait
for this horrible scene, and bear the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) magnanimity. The
desire to return to Lheureux's seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--what would be the use? To
write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father--it was too late; and perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to repent
now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not yielded to that other, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard the trot of
a horse in the alley. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was opening the gate; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was whiter
than the plaster wall. Rushing to the stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ran out quickly to the
square; and the wife of the mayor, who was talking to Lestiboudois in
front of the church, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) go in to the tax-collector's.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hurried off to tell Madame Caron, and the two ladies went up to
the attic, and, hidden by some linen spread across props, stationed
themselves comfortably for overlooking the whole of Binet's room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) was alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) garret, busy imitating in wood one of those
indescribable bits of ivory, composed of crescents, of spheres hollowed
out one within the other, the whole as straight as an obelisk, and of no
use whatever; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) was beginning on the last piece--he (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) was nearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>)
goal. In the twilight of the workshop the white dust was flying from his (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>)
tools like a shower of sparks under the hoofs of a galloping horse; the
two wheels were turning, droning; Binet smiled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) chin lowered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>)
nostrils distended, and, in a word, seemed lost in one of those complete
happinesses that, no doubt, belong only to commonplace occupations,
which amuse the mind with facile difficulties, and satisfy by a
realisation of that beyond which such minds have not a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! there she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Madame Tuvache.

<p/>But it was impossible because of the lathe to hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) was saying.

<p/>At last these ladies thought they made out the word <div class="bookquote">``francs,''  (<font color='red'><b>these ladies</b></font>)</div>and Madame
Tuvache whispered in a low voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is begging him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) time for paying her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) taxes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Apparently!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.

<p/>They saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) walking up and down, examining the napkin-rings, the
candlesticks, the banister rails against the walls, while Binet stroked
his (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) beard with satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wants to order something of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame Tuvache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't sell anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div>objected her (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) neighbour.

<p/>The tax-collector seemed to be listening with wide-open eyes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
did not understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) went on in a tender, suppliant manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) came
nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) breast heaving; they no longer spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) making him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advances?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame Tuvache. Binet was scarlet to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) very ears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) took hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's too much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) was suggesting something abominable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>); for the
tax-collector--yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) was brave, had fought at Bautzen and at Lutzen,
had been through the French campaign, and had even been recommended for
the cross--suddenly, as at the sight of a serpent, recoiled as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
could from her (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>), crying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame! what do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women like that ought to be whipped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame Tuvache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Caron/Caron</b></font>)</div>continued Madame Caron, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) had disappeared
whilst they spoke; then catching sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) going up the Grande Rue,
and turning to the right as if making for the cemetery, they were lost
in conjectures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nurse Rollet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) said on reaching the nurse's, <div class="bookquote">``I am choking; unlace
me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) fell on the bed sobbing. Nurse Rollet covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) with a
petticoat and remained standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) side. Then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Caron</b></font>) did not
answer, the good woman withdrew, took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wheel and began spinning flax.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, leave off!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured, fancying she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard Binet's lathe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's bothering her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse to herself. <div class="bookquote">``Why has she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) come
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had rushed thither; impelled by a kind of horror that drove her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) from
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) home.

<p/>Lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) back, motionless, and with staring eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) saw things but
vaguely, although she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) tried to with idiotic persistence. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) looked
at the scales on the walls, two brands smoking end to end, and a long
spider crawling over her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) head in a rent in the beam. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) began
to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) remembered--one day--Leon--Oh! how long
ago that was--the sun was shining on the river, and the clematis were
perfuming the air. Then, carried away as by a rushing torrent, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) soon
began to recall the day before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Mere Rollet went out, raised the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) right hand to that side
of the sky that was brightest, and came back slowly, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rollet/Mere Rollet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! thanks, thanks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) would come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) would have found some money. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) would,
perhaps, go down yonder, not guessing she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was here, and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) told the
nurse to run to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) house to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear lady, I'm going, I'm going!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) wondered now that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had not thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) from the first.
Yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) word; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) would not break it. And she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) already
saw herself at Lheureux's spreading out her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) three bank-notes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
bureau. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would have to invent some story to explain matters to
Bovary. What should it be?

<p/>The nurse, however, was a long while gone. But, as there was no clock
in the cot, Emma feared she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was perhaps exaggerating the length of time.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began walking round the garden, step by step; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went into the path
by the hedge, and returned quickly, hoping that the woman would have
come back by another road. At last, weary of waiting, assailed by fears
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thrust from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), no longer conscious whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been here
a century or a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down in a corner, closed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, and
stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ears. The gate grated; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sprang up. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had spoken
Mere Rollet said to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no one at your house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rollet/Mere Rollet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no one! And the doctor is crying. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is calling for you; they're
looking for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma answered nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gasped as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), while the peasant woman, frightened at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, drew back
instinctively, thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mad. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brow and
uttered a cry; for the thought of Rodolphe, like a flash of lightning in
a dark night, had passed into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was so good, so delicate, so
generous! And besides, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) hesitate to do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) this service, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would know well enough how to constrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) to it by re-waking, in a
single moment, their lost love. So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) set out towards La Huchette, not
seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was hastening to offer herself to that which but a while
ago had so angered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), not in the least conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prostitution.



<p/>Chapter Eight

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked along, <div class="bookquote">``What am I going to say? How
shall I begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) recognised the thickets,
the trees, the sea-rushes on the hill, the chateau yonder. All the
sensations of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first tenderness came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor aching
heart opened out amorously. A warm wind blew in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; the melting
snow fell drop by drop from the buds to the grass.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) used to, through the small park-gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reached
the avenue bordered by a double row of dense lime-trees. They were
swaying their long whispering branches to and fro. The dogs in their
kennels all barked, and the noise of their voices resounded, but brought
out no one.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went up the large straight staircase with wooden balusters that led
to the corridor paved with dusty flags, into which several doors in a
row opened, as in a monastery or an inn. His (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at the top, right
at the end, on the left. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) placed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers on the lock her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
strength suddenly deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was afraid, almost wished he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would not be there, though this was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only hope, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last chance of
salvation. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) collected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts for one moment, and, strengthening
herself by the feeling of present necessity, went in.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in front of the fire, both his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet on the mantelpiece, smoking a
pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! it is you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, getting up hurriedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is I, Rodolphe. I should like to ask your advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And, despite all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) efforts, it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to open her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not changed; you are charming as ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``they are poor charms since you disdained
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began a long explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conduct, excusing himself in
vague terms, in default of being able to invent better.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yielded to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words, still more to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice and the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
so that, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretended to believe, or perhaps believed; in the pretext
he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave for their rupture; this was a secret on which depended the
honour, the very life of a third person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I have suffered much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied philosophically--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such is life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Emma went on, <div class="bookquote">``been good to you at least, since our
separation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, neither good nor bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it would have been better never to have parted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, drawing nearer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Rodolphe!
if you but knew! I loved you so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, and they remained some time, their
fingers intertwined, like that first day at the Show. With a gesture of
pride he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) struggled against this emotion. But sinking upon his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you think I could live without you? One cannot lose the habit
of happiness. I was desolate. I thought I should die. I will tell you
about all that and you will see. And you--you fled from me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>For, all the three years, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had carefully avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in consequence
of that natural cowardice that characterises the stronger sex. Emma went
on, with dainty little nods, more coaxing than an amorous kitten--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You love others, confess it! Oh, I understand them, dear! I excuse
them. You probably seduced them as you seduced me. You are indeed a man;
you have everything to make one love you. But we'll begin again, won't
we? We will love one another. See! I am laughing; I am happy! Oh,
speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>an kitten</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was charming to see, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, in which trembled a tear,
like the rain of a storm in a blue corolla.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees, and with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand was
caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) smooth hair, where in the twilight was mirrored like a
golden arrow one last ray of the sun. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bent down her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brow; at last he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) on the eyelids quite gently with the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you have been crying! What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) burst into tears. Rodolphe thought this was an outburst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
love. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) took this silence for a last remnant of
resistance, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) cried out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, forgive me! You are the only one who pleases me. I was imbecile and
cruel. I love you. I will love you always. What is it. Tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was
kneeling by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am ruined, Rodolphe! You must lend me three thousand francs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--but--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), getting up slowly, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) face assumed a grave
expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on quickly, <div class="bookquote">``that my husband had placed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) whole
fortune at a notary's. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ran away. So we borrowed; the patients don't
pay us. Moreover, the settling of the estate is not yet done; we shall
have the money later on. But to-day, for want of three thousand francs,
we are to be sold up. It is to be at once, this very moment, and,
counting upon your friendship, I have come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>thought Rodolphe, turning very pale, <div class="bookquote">``that was what she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) came for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said with a calm air--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear madame, I have not got them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) did not lie. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) had had them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) would, no doubt, have given them,
although it is generally disagreeable to do such fine things: a demand
for money being, of all the winds that blow upon love, the coldest and
most destructive.

<p/>First she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) for some moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not got them!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) repeated several times. <div class="bookquote">``You have not got
them! I ought to have spared myself this last shame. You never loved me.
You are no better than the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was betraying, ruining herself.

<p/>Rodolphe interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``hard up''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I pity you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes upon an embossed carabine, that shone against its
panoply, <div class="bookquote">``But when one is so poor one doesn't have silver on the butt of
one's gun. One doesn't buy a clock inlaid with tortoise shell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went
on, pointing to a buhl timepiece, <div class="bookquote">``nor silver-gilt whistles for one's
whips,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) touched them, <div class="bookquote">``nor charms for one's watch. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wants
for nothing! even to a liqueur-stand in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) room! For you love yourself;
you live well. You have a chateau, farms, woods; you go hunting; you
travel to Paris. Why, if it were but that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried, taking up two
studs from the mantelpiece, <div class="bookquote">``but the least of these trifles, one can get
money for them. Oh, I do not want them, keep them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw the two links away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), their gold chain breaking as
it struck against the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I! I would have given you everything. I would have sold all, worked
for you with my hands, I would have begged on the highroads for a smile,
for a look, to hear you say `Thanks!' And you sit there quietly in your
arm-chair, as if you had not made me suffer enough already! But for you,
and you know it, I might have lived happily. What made you do it? Was
it a bet? Yet you loved me--you said so. And but a moment since--Ah!
it would have been better to have driven me away. My hands are hot with
your kisses, and there is the spot on the carpet where at my knees you
swore an eternity of love! You made me believe you; for two years you
held me in the most magnificent, the sweetest dream! Eh! Our plans for
the journey, do you remember? Oh, your letter! your letter! it tore my
heart! And then when I come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), rich, happy, free--to
implore the help the first stranger would give, a suppliant, and
bringing back to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) all my tenderness, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) repulses me because it would
cost him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) three thousand francs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodolphe/Monsieur Boulanger/Monsieur Rodolphe</b></font>)</div>replied Rodolphe, with that perfect calm with
which resigned rage covers itself as with a shield.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went out. The walls trembled, the ceiling was crushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
passed back through the long alley, stumbling against the heaps of dead
leaves scattered by the wind. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reached the ha-ha hedge in
front of the gate; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nails against the lock in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) haste to
open it. Then a hundred steps farther on, breathless, almost falling,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped. And now turning round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) once more saw the impassive
chateau, with the park, the gardens, the three courts, and all the
windows of the facade.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) remained lost in stupor, and having no more consciousness of herself
than through the beating of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arteries, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to hear
bursting forth like a deafening music filling all the fields. The earth
beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feet was more yielding than the sea, and the furrows seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immense brown waves breaking into foam. Everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
head, of memories, ideas, went off at once like a thousand pieces of
fireworks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, Lheureux's closet, their room at home,
another landscape. Madness was coming upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grew afraid, and
managed to recover herself, in a confused way, it is true, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did
not in the least remember the cause of the terrible condition she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
in, that is to say, the question of money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suffered only in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
love, and felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soul passing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in this memory; as wounded men,
dying, feel their life ebb from their bleeding wounds.

<p/>Night was falling, crows were flying about.

<p/>Suddenly it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that fiery spheres were exploding in the air
like fulminating balls when they strike, and were whirling, whirling,
to melt at last upon the snow between the branches of the trees. In the
midst of each of them appeared the face of Rodolphe. They multiplied and
drew near her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), penetrating, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It all disappeared; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recognised the
lights of the houses that shone through the fog.

<p/>Now her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation, like an abyss, rose up before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was panting as
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart would burst. Then in an ecstasy of heroism, that made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) almost joyous, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ran down the hill, crossed the cow-plank, the
foot-path, the alley, the market, and reached the chemist's shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was about to enter, but at the sound of the bell someone might come, and
slipping in by the gate, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breath, feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way along the
walls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went as far as the door of the kitchen, where a candle stuck
on the stove was burning. Justin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) shirt-sleeves was carrying out a
dish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! they are dining; I will wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) returned; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tapped at the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) went out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The key! the one for upstairs where he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) keeps the--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), astonished at the pallor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face, that stood
out white against the black background of the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) extraordinarily beautiful and majestic as a phantom. Without
understanding what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) had the presentiment of something
terrible.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on quickly in a love voice; in a sweet, melting voice, <div class="bookquote">``I
want it; give it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As the partition wall was thin, they could hear the clatter of the forks
on the plates in the dining-room.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pretended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to kill the rats that kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from
sleeping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must tell master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then with an indifferent air, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's not worth while;
I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) presently. Come, light me upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) entered the corridor into which the laboratory door opened. Against
the wall was a key labelled Capharnaum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Justin!''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>called the druggist impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The key turned in the lock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went straight
to the third shelf, so well did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) memory guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), seized the blue
jar, tore out the cork, plunged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, and withdrawing it full of
a white powder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began eating it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) cried, rushing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! someone will come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) was in despair, was calling out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say nothing, or all the blame will fall on your master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went home, suddenly calmed, and with something of the serenity
of one that had performed a duty.

<p/>When Charles, distracted by the news of the distraint, returned home,
Emma had just gone out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cried aloud, wept, fainted, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not
return. Where could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) be? He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent Felicite to Homais, to Monsieur
Tuvache, to Lheureux, to the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>everywhere, and in the
intervals of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) agony he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reputation destroyed, their fortune
lost, Berthe's future ruined. By what?--Not a word! He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) waited till six
in the evening. At last, unable to bear it any longer, and fancying she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had gone to Rouen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) set out along the highroad, walked a mile, met no
one, again waited, and returned home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had come back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was the matter? Why? Explain to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) writing-table and wrote a letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sealed
slowly, adding the date and the hour. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said in a solemn tone:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are to read it to-morrow; till then, I pray you, do not ask me a
single question. No, not one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, leave me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lay down full length on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bed. A bitter taste that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
mouth awakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Charles, and again closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was studying herself curiously, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) were not suffering.
But no! nothing as yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard the ticking of the clock, the
crackling of the fire, and Charles breathing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stood upright by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it is but a little thing, death!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``I shall fall asleep
and all will be over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drank a mouthful of water and turned to the wall. The frightful
taste of ink continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thirsty; oh! so thirsty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles, who was handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing! Open the window; I am choking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was seized with a sickness so sudden that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had hardly time to
draw out her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) handkerchief from under the pillow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said quickly; <div class="bookquote">``throw it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lay motionless, afraid that
the slightest movement might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) vomit. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt an icy cold
creeping from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it is beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head from side to side with a gentle movement full of
agony, while constantly opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth as if something very heavy
were weighing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tongue. At eight o’clock the vomiting began
again.

<p/>Charles noticed that at the bottom of the basin there was a sort of
white sediment sticking to the sides of the porcelain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is extraordinary--very singular,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said in a firm voice, <div class="bookquote">``No, you are mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then gently, and almost as caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
stomach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) uttered a sharp cry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fell back terror-stricken.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to groan, faintly at first. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) shoulders were shaken by
a strong shuddering, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was growing paler than the sheets in which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) clenched fingers buried themselves. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unequal pulse was now almost
imperceptible.

<p/>Drops of sweat oozed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bluish face, that seemed as if rigid in
the exhalations of a metallic vapour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) teeth chattered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dilated
eyes looked vaguely about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and to all questions she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied only
with a shake of the head; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even smiled once or twice. Gradually, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
moaning grew louder; a hollow shriek burst from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pretended she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was better and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would get up presently. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was seized with
convulsions and cried out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my God! It is horrible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) threw himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knees by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me! what have you eaten? Answer, for heaven's sake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never
seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there--there!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said in a faint voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) flew to the
writing-table, tore open the seal, and read aloud: <div class="bookquote">``Accuse no one.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
stopped, passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands across his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, and read it over again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! help--help!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could only keep repeating the word: <div class="bookquote">``Poisoned! poisoned!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Felicite
ran to Homais, who proclaimed it in the market-place; Madame Lefrancois
heard it at the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or'' (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lefrancois/Lefrancois</b></font>)</div>; some got up to go and tell their
neighbours, and all night the village was on the alert.

<p/>Distraught, faltering, reeling, Charles wandered about the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
knocked against the furniture, tore his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hair, and the chemist had never
believed that there could be so terrible a sight.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went home to write to Monsieur Canivet and to Doctor Lariviere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head, and made more than fifteen rough copies. Hippolyte went
to Neufchatel, and Justin so spurred Bovary's horse that he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) left it
foundered and three parts dead by the hill at Bois-Guillaume.

<p/>Charles tried to look up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) medical dictionary, but could not read it;
the lines were dancing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be calm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>said the druggist; <div class="bookquote">``we have only to administer a powerful
antidote. What is the poison?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the letter. It was arsenic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said Homais, <div class="bookquote">``we must make an analysis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew that in cases of poisoning an analysis must be made; and the
other, who did not understand, answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do anything! save her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sank upon the carpet, and lay there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
head leaning against the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) bed, sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Soon I shall not trouble you any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why was it? Who drove you to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It had to be, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Weren't you happy? Is it my fault? I did all I could!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is true--you are good--you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) hand slowly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hair. The sweetness of this
sensation deepened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sadness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whole being dissolving
in despair at the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>), just when she (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) was
confessing more love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) than ever. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could think of nothing;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not dare; the urgent need for some immediate
resolution gave the finishing stroke to the turmoil of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mind.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) had done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) thought, with all the treachery; and meanness,
and numberless desires that had tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) hated no one now; a
twilight dimness was settling upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) thoughts, and, of all earthly
noises, Emma heard none but the intermittent lamentations of this poor
heart, sweet and indistinct like the echo of a symphony dying away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring me the child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, raising herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) elbow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not worse, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>asked Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child, serious, and still half-asleep, was carried in on the
servant's arm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) long white nightgown, from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bare
feet peeped out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked wonderingly at the disordered room, and
half-closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, dazzled by the candles burning on the table. They
reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), no doubt, of the morning of New Year's day and Mid-Lent,
when thus awakened early by candle-light she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother's bed to
fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) presents, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where is it, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And as everybody was silent, <div class="bookquote">``But I can't see
my little stocking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Felicite held her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) over the bed while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) still kept looking towards the
mantelpiece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has nurse taken it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked.

<p/>And at this name, that carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back to the memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) adulteries
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) calamities, Madame Bovary turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, as at the
loathing of another bitterer poison that rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth. But Berthe
remained perched on the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how big your eyes are, mamma! How pale you are! how hot you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am frightened!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>cried the child, recoiling.

<p/>Emma took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand to kiss it; the child struggled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do. Take her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>cried Charles, who was sobbing in the
alcove.

<p/>Then the symptoms ceased for a moment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed less agitated; and at
every insignificant word, at every respiration a little more easy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
regained hope. At last, when Canivet came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) threw himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it is you. Thanks! You are good! But she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is better. See! look at
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>colleague</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) colleague was by no means of this opinion, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said of
himself, <div class="bookquote">``never beating about the bush,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) prescribed, an emetic in
order to empty the stomach completely.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon began vomiting blood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips became drawn. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) limbs were
convulsed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whole body covered with brown spots, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pulse
slipped beneath the fingers like a stretched thread, like a harp-string
nearly breaking.

<p/>After this she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to scream horribly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cursed the poison, railed
at it, and implored it to be quick, and thrust away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stiffened
arms everything that Charles, in more agony than herself, tried to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stood up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) handkerchief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lips, with a rattling
sound in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) throat, weeping, and choked by sobs that shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whole
body. Felicite was running hither and thither in the room. Homais,
motionless, uttered great sighs; and Monsieur Canivet, always retaining
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) self-command, nevertheless began to feel uneasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil! yet she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) has been purged, and from the moment that the cause
ceases--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The effect must cease,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said Homais, <div class="bookquote">``that is evident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, save her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Bovary.

<p/>And, without listening to the chemist, who was still venturing the
hypothesis, <div class="bookquote">``It is perhaps a salutary paroxysm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>Canivet was about to
administer some theriac, when they heard the cracking of a whip; all the
windows rattled, and a post-chaise drawn by three horses abreast, up to
their ears in mud, drove at a gallop round the corner of the market. It
was Doctor Lariviere.

<p/>The apparition of a god would not have caused more commotion. Bovary
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hands; Canivet stopped short; and Homais pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
skull-cap long before the doctor had come in.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) belonged to that great school of surgery begotten of Bichat, to that
generation, now extinct, of philosophical practitioners, who, loving
their art with a fanatical love, exercised it with enthusiasm and
wisdom. Everyone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hospital trembled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was angry; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
students so revered him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) that they tried, as soon as they were themselves
in practice, to imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) as much as possible. So that in all the
towns about they were found wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) long wadded merino overcoat
and black frock-coat, whose buttoned cuffs slightly covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) brawny
hands--very beautiful hands, and that never knew gloves, as though to be
more ready to plunge into suffering. Disdainful of honours, of titles,
and of academies, like one of the old Knight-Hospitallers, generous,
fatherly to the poor, and practising virtue without believing in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
would almost have passed for a saint if the keenness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) intellect
had not caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to be feared as a demon. His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) glance, more penetrating
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) bistouries, looked straight into your soul, and dissected every
lie athwart all assertions and all reticences. And thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) went along,
full of that debonair majesty that is given by the consciousness
of great talent, of fortune, and of forty years of a labourious and
irreproachable life.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) frowned as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had passed the door when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) saw the cadaverous
face of Emma stretched out on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth open. Then, while
apparently listening to Canivet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) fingers up and down
beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) nostrils, and repeated--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) made a slow gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) shoulders. Bovary watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); they
looked at one another; and this man, accustomed as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to the sight
of pain, could not keep back a tear that fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shirt-frill.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to take Canivet into the next room. Charles followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is very ill, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)? If we put on sinapisms? Anything! Oh, think
of something, you who have saved so many!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arms, and gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wildly,
imploringly, half-fainting against his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, my poor fellow, courage! There is nothing more to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>And Doctor Lariviere turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went out only to give an order to the coachman, with Monsieur
Canivet, who did not care either to have Emma die under his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands.

<p/>The chemist rejoined them on the Place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not by temperament keep
away from celebrities, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) begged Monsieur Lariviere to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the
signal honour of accepting some breakfast.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent quickly to the <div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>for some pigeons; to the butcher's
for all the cutlets that were to be had; to Tuvache for cream; and
to Lestiboudois for eggs; and the druggist himself aided in the
preparations, while Madame Homais was saying as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lariviere</b></font>) pulled together the
strings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lariviere</b></font>) jacket--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must excuse us, sir, for in this poor place, when one hasn't been
told the night before--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wine glasses!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>whispered Homais.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If only we were in town, we could fall back upon stuffed trotters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet! Sit down, doctor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought fit, after the first few mouthfuls, to give some details as
to the catastrophe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We first had a feeling of siccity in the pharynx, then intolerable
pains at the epigastrium, super purgation, coma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) poison herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, doctor, and I don't even know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) can have procured
the arsenious acid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Justin</b></font>)</div><p/>Justin, who was just bringing in a pile of plates, began to tremble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist.

<p/>At this question the young man dropped the whole lot on the ground with
a crash.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Imbecile!''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>cried Homais, <div class="bookquote">``awkward lout! block-head! confounded ass!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>But suddenly controlling himself--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wished, doctor, to make an analysis, and primo I delicately
introduced a tube--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have done better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>said the physician, <div class="bookquote">``to introduce your
fingers into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) throat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) colleague was silent, having just before privately received a severe
lecture about his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) emetic, so that this good Canivet, so arrogant and so
verbose at the time of the clubfoot, was to-day very modest. He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) smiled
without ceasing in an approving manner.

<p/>Homais dilated in Amphytrionic pride, and the affecting thought of
Bovary vaguely contributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) pleasure by a kind of egotistic
reflex upon himself. Then the presence of the doctor transported him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) displayed his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) erudition, cited pell-mell cantharides, upas, the
manchineel, vipers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have even read that various persons have found themselves
under toxicological symptoms, and, as it were, thunderstricken by
black-pudding that had been subjected to a too vehement fumigation.
At least, this was stated in a very fine report drawn up by one of our
pharmaceutical chiefs, one of our masters, the illustrious Cadet de
Gassicourt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Homais reappeared, carrying one of those shaky machines that
are heated with spirits of wine; for Homais liked to make his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coffee
at table, having, moreover, torrefied it, pulverised it, and mixed it
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saccharum, doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), offering the sugar.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had all his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) children brought down, anxious to have the
physician's opinion on their constitutions.

<p/>At last Monsieur Lariviere was about to leave, when Madame Homais asked
for a consultation about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lariviere</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was making his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blood too thick
by going to sleep every evening after dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it isn't his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) blood that's too thick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>said the physician.

<p/>And, smiling a little at his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) unnoticed joke, the doctor opened the
door. But the chemist's shop was full of people; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had the greatest
difficulty in getting rid of Monsieur Tuvache, who feared his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spouse
would get inflammation of the lungs, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lariviere</b></font>) was in the habit of
spitting on the ashes; then of Monsieur Binet, who sometimes experienced
sudden attacks of great hunger; and of Madame Caron, who suffered
from tinglings; of Lheureux, who had vertigo; of Lestiboudois, who had
rheumatism; and of Madame Lefrancois, who had heartburn. At last the
three horses started; and it was the general opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) had not
shown himself at all obliging.

<p/>Public attention was distracted by the appearance of Monsieur
Bournisien, who was going across the market with the holy oil.

<p/>Homais, as was due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) principles, compared priests to ravens
attracted by the odour of death. The sight of an ecclesiastic was
personally disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>), for the cassock made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) think of the
shroud, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) detested the one from some fear of the other.

<p/>Nevertheless, not shrinking from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) mission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) returned
to Bovary's in company with Canivet whom Monsieur Lariviere, before
leaving, had strongly urged to make this visit; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) would, but for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) wife's objections, have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) two sons with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>), in order
to accustom them to great occasions; that this might be a lesson, an
example, a solemn picture, that should remain in their heads later on.

<p/>The room when they went in was full of mournful solemnity. On the
work-table, covered over with a white cloth, there were five or six
small balls of cotton in a silver dish, near a large crucifix between
two lighted candles.

<p/>Emma, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chin sunken upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breast, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes inordinately wide
open, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) poor hands wandered over the sheets with that hideous
and soft movement of the dying, that seems as if they wanted already to
cover themselves with the shroud. Pale as a statue and with eyes red as
fire, Charles, not weeping, stood opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at the foot of the bed,
while the priest, bending one knee, was muttering words in a low voice.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face slowly, and seemed filled with joy on seeing
suddenly the violet stole, no doubt finding again, in the midst of
a temporary lull in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pain, the lost voluptuousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first
mystical transports, with the visions of eternal beatitude that were
beginning.

<p/>The priest rose to take the crucifix; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stretched forward her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
neck as one who is athirst, and glueing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips to the body of the
Man-God, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pressed upon it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) expiring strength the fullest
kiss of love that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever given. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) recited the Misereatur and
the Indulgentiam, dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) right thumb in the oil, and began to give
extreme unction. First upon the eyes, that had so coveted all worldly
pomp; then upon the nostrils, that had been greedy of the warm breeze
and amorous odours; then upon the mouth, that had uttered lies, that had
curled with pride and cried out in lewdness; then upon the hands that
had delighted in sensual touches; and finally upon the soles of the
feet, so swift of yore, when she (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was running to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) desires, and
that would now walk no more.

<p/>The cure wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) fingers, threw the bit of cotton dipped in oil into
the fire, and came and sat down by the dying woman, to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must now blend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sufferings with those of Jesus Christ and abandon
herself to the divine mercy.

<p/>Finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) exhortations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) tried to place in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand a blessed
candle, symbol of the celestial glory with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was soon to be
surrounded. Emma, too weak, could not close her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fingers, and the taper,
but for Monsieur Bournisien would have fallen to the ground.

<p/>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not quite so pale, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face had an expression of
serenity as if the sacrament had cured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>The priest did not fail to point this out; he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) even explained to Bovary
that the Lord sometimes prolonged the life of persons when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thought it
meet for their salvation; and Charles remembered the day when, so near
death, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had received the communion. Perhaps there was no need to
despair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought.

<p/>In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) slowly, as one awakening from a dream;
then in a distinct voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looking-glass, and remained
some time bending over it, until the big tears fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head with a sigh and fell back upon the pillows.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chest soon began panting rapidly; the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tongue protruded
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mouth; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, as they rolled, grew paler, like the two
globes of a lamp that is going out, so that one might have thought
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) already dead but for the fearful labouring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ribs, shaken
by violent breathing, as if the soul were struggling to free itself.
Felicite knelt down before the crucifix, and the druggist himself
slightly bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knees, while Monsieur Canivet looked out vaguely at
the Place. Bournisien had again begun to pray, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face bowed against
the edge of the bed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) long black cassock trailing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the
room. Charles was on the other side, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knees, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arms outstretched
towards Emma. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands and pressed them, shuddering at
every beat of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, as at the shaking of a falling ruin. As the
death-rattle became stronger the priest prayed faster; his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) prayers
mingled with the stifled sobs of Bovary, and sometimes all seemed lost
in the muffled murmur of the Latin syllables that tolled like a passing
bell.

<p/>Suddenly on the pavement was heard a loud noise of clogs and the
clattering of a stick; and a voice rose--a raucous voice--that sang--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maids in the warmth of a summer day Dream of love and of love always''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Mademoiselle Emma/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma raised herself like a galvanised corpse, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair undone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes
fixed, staring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where the sickle blades have been, Nannette, gathering ears of corn,
Passes bending down, my queen, To the earth where they were born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The blind man!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried. And Emma began to laugh, an atrocious,
frantic, despairing laugh, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the hideous face of the poor
wretch that stood out against the eternal night like a menace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The wind is strong this summer day, Her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) petticoat has flown away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell back upon the mattress in a convulsion. They all drew near. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was dead.



<p/>Chapter Nine

<p/>There is always after the death of anyone a kind of stupefaction;
so difficult is it to grasp this advent of nothingness and to resign
ourselves to believe in it. But still, when he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not
move, Charles threw himself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), crying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell! farewell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Homais and Canivet dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) from the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Restrain yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), struggling, <div class="bookquote">``I'll be quiet. I'll not do anything. But
leave me alone. I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) is my wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist; <div class="bookquote">``let nature take her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) course; that will solace
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/>Weaker than a child, Charles let himself be led downstairs into the
sitting-room, and Monsieur Homais soon went home. On the Place he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was accosted by the blind man, who, having dragged himself as far as
Yonville, in the hope of getting the antiphlogistic pomade, was asking
every passer-by where the druggist lived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There now! as if I hadn't got other fish to fry. Well, so much the
worse; you must come later on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) entered the shop hurriedly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) had to write two letters, to prepare a soothing potion for Bovary, to
invent some lie that would conceal the poisoning, and work it up into an
article for the <div class="bookquote">``Fanal,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>without counting the people who were waiting to
get the news from him (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>); and when the Yonvillers had all heard his (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) story
of the arsenic that she (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) had mistaken for sugar in making a vanilla
cream. Homais once more returned to Bovary's.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) alone -LRB-Monsieur Canivet had left-RRB-, sitting in an arm-chair
near the window, staring with an idiotic look at the flags of the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist, <div class="bookquote">``you ought yourself to fix the hour for the
ceremony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? What ceremony?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then, in a stammering, frightened voice, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!
not that. No! I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Homais, to keep himself in countenance, took up a water-bottle on the
whatnot to water the geraniums.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles; <div class="bookquote">``you are good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not finish, choking beneath the crowd of memories that this
action of the druggist recalled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>Then to distract him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), Homais thought fit to talk a little horticulture:
plants wanted humidity. Charles bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head in sign of approbation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, the fine days will soon be here again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>said Bovary.

<p/>The druggist, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wit's end, began softly to draw aside the small
window-curtain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo! there's Monsieur Tuvache passing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles repeated like a machine--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Tuvache passing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Homais did not dare to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) again about the funeral
arrangements; it was the priest who succeeded in reconciling him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) to
them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) shut himself up in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) consulting-room, took a pen, and after sobbing
for some time, wrote--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) to be buried in her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) wedding-dress, with white shoes, and a
wreath. Her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) hair is to be spread out over her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) shoulders. Three coffins,
one of oak, one of mahogany, one of lead. Let no one say anything to me.
I shall have strength. Over all there is to be placed a large piece of
green velvet. This is my wish; see that it is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men were much surprised at Bovary's romantic ideas. The chemist
at once went to him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This velvet seems to me a superfetation. Besides, the expense--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>cried Charles. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me! You did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>).
Go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The priest</b></font>)</div><p/>The priest took him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) by the arm for a turn in the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) discoursed
on the vanity of earthly things. God was very great, was very good: one
must submit to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) decrees without a murmur; nay, must even thank him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).

<p/>Charles burst out into blasphemies: <div class="bookquote">``I hate your God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The spirit of rebellion is still upon you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>sighed the ecclesiastic.

<p/>Bovary was far away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was walking with great strides along by the
wall, near the espalier, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) teeth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) raised to heaven
looks of malediction, but not so much as a leaf stirred.

<p/>A fine rain was falling: Charles, whose chest was bare, at last began to
shiver; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went in and sat down in the kitchen.

<p/>At six o’clock a noise like a clatter of old iron was heard on the
Place; it was the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>coming in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) remained with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
forehead against the windowpane, watching all the passengers get
out, one after the other. Felicite put down a mattress for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in the
drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) threw himself upon it and fell asleep.

<p/>Although a philosopher, Monsieur Homais respected the dead. So bearing
no grudge to poor Charles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came back again in the evening to sit up
with the body; bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) three volumes and a pocket-book for
taking notes.

<p/>Monsieur Bournisien was there, and two large candles were burning at the
head of the bed, that had been taken out of the alcove. The druggist, on
whom the silence weighed, was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) began formulating some
regrets about this <div class="bookquote">``unfortunate young woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the priest replied
that there was nothing to do now but pray for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>Homais went on, <div class="bookquote">``one of two things; either she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died in a state of
grace -LRB-as the Church has it-RRB-, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has no need of our prayers;
or else she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) departed impertinent -LRB-that is, I believe, the ecclesiastical
expression-RRB-, and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Bournisien interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), replying testily that it was none the less
necessary to pray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>objected the chemist, <div class="bookquote">``since God knows all our needs, what can be
the good of prayer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the ecclesiastic, <div class="bookquote">``prayer! Why, aren't you a Christian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said Homais; <div class="bookquote">``I admire Christianity. To begin with, it
enfranchised the slaves, introduced into the world a morality--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That isn't the question. All the texts-''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! oh! As to texts, look at history; it, is known that all the texts
have been falsified by the Jesuits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles came in, and advancing towards the bed, slowly drew the
curtains.

<p/>Emma's head was turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) right shoulder, the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
mouth, which was open, seemed like a black hole at the lower part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
face; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) two thumbs were bent into the palms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hands; a kind
of white dust besprinkled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lashes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes were beginning to
disappear in that viscous pallor that looks like a thin web, as if
spiders had spun it over. The sheet sunk in from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) breast to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
knees, and then rose at the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) toes, and it seemed to Charles
that infinite masses, an enormous load, were weighing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>The church clock struck two. They could hear the loud murmur of the
river flowing in the darkness at the foot of the terrace. Monsieur
Bournisien from time to time blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) nose noisily, and Homais' pen was
scratching over the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, my good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``withdraw; this spectacle is tearing
you to pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles once gone, the chemist and the cure recommenced their
discussions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read Voltaire,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the one, <div class="bookquote">``read D’Holbach, read the
`Encyclopaedia'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Read the `Letters of some Portuguese Jews,''' said the other; <div class="bookquote">``read `The
Meaning of Christianity,' by Nicolas, formerly a magistrate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They grew warm, they grew red, they both talked at once without
listening to each other. Bournisien was scandalized at such audacity;
Homais marvelled at such stupidity; and they were on the point of
insulting one another when Charles suddenly reappeared. A fascination
drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was continually coming upstairs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stood opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), the better to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lost himself in a
contemplation so deep that it was no longer painful.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recalled stories of catalepsy, the marvels of magnetism, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
said to himself that by willing it with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) force he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might perhaps
succeed in reviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) even bent towards he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and cried in a
low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Emma! Emma!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) strong breathing made the flames of the
candles tremble against the wall.

<p/>At daybreak Madame Bovary senior arrived. Charles as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
burst into another flood of tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tried, as the chemist had done,
to make some remarks to him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) on the expenses of the funeral. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) became so
angry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was silent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) even commissioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to go to town at
once and buy what was necessary.

<p/>Charles remained alone the whole afternoon; they had taken Berthe
to Madame Homais'; Felicite was in the room upstairs with Madame
Lefrancois.

<p/>In the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) had some visitors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) rose, pressed their hands,
unable to speak. Then they sat down near one another, and formed a large
semicircle in front of the fire. With lowered faces, and swinging one
leg crossed over the other knee, they uttered deep sighs at intervals;
each one was inordinately bored, and yet none would be the first to go.

<p/>Homais, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) returned at nine o’clock -LRB-for the last two days only
Homais seemed to have been on the Place-RRB-, was laden with a stock of
camphor, of benzine, and aromatic herbs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) also carried a large jar
full of chlorine water, to keep off all miasmata. Just then the servant,
Madame Lefrancois, and Madame Bovary senior were busy about Emma,
finishing dressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and they were drawing down the long stiff veil
that covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) satin shoes.

<p/>Felicite was sobbing--<div class="bookquote">``Ah! my poor mistress! my poor mistress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felicite</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady, sighing; <div class="bookquote">``how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) still is!
Now, couldn't you swear she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was going to get up in a minute?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) wreath. They had to raise the head
a little, and a rush of black liquid issued, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) were vomiting,
from her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, goodness! The dress; take care!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>cried Madame Lefrancois. <div class="bookquote">``Now,
just come and help,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said to the chemist. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you're afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I afraid?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>), shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say! I've seen
all sorts of things at the hospital when I was studying pharmacy. We
used to make punch in the dissecting room! Nothingness does not terrify
a philosopher; and, as I often say, I even intend to leave my body to
the hospitals, in order, later on, to serve science.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/>The cure on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) arrival inquired how Monsieur Bovary was, and, on
the reply of the druggist, went on--<div class="bookquote">``The blow, you see, is still too
recent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Homais congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefrancois</b></font>) on not being exposed, like other people,
to the loss of a beloved companion; whence there followed a discussion
on the celibacy of priests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist, <div class="bookquote">``it is unnatural that a man should do without
women! There have been crimes--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, good heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the ecclesiastic, <div class="bookquote">``how do you expect an
individual who is married to keep the secrets of the confessional, for
example?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Homais fell foul of the confessional. Bournisien defended it; he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>)
enlarged on the acts of restitution that it brought about. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) cited
various anecdotes about thieves who had suddenly become honest. Military
men on approaching the tribunal of penitence had felt the scales fall
from their eyes. At Fribourg there was a minister--

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) companion was asleep. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) felt somewhat stifled by the
over-heavy atmosphere of the room; he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) opened the window; this awoke the
chemist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, take a pinch of snuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Take it; it'll relieve
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A continual barking was heard in the distance. <div class="bookquote">``Do you hear that dog
howling?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>said the chemist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They smell the dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>replied the priest. <div class="bookquote">``It's like bees; they leave
their hives on the decease of any person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Homais made no remark upon these prejudices, for he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) had again dropped
asleep. Monsieur Bournisien, stronger than he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>), went on moving his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) lips
gently for some time, then insensibly his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) chin sank down, he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) let fall
his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) big black boot, and began to snore.

<p/>They sat opposite one another, with protruding stomachs, puffed-up
faces, and frowning looks, after so much disagreement uniting at last in
the same human weakness, and they moved no more than the corpse by their
side, that seemed to be sleeping.

<p/>Charles coming in did not wake them. It was the last time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came to
bid her (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) farewell.

<p/>The aromatic herbs were still smoking, and spirals of bluish vapour
blended at the window-sash with the fog that was coming in. There were
few stars, and the night was warm. The wax of the candles fell in great
drops upon the sheets of the bed. Charles watched them burn, tiring his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
eyes against the glare of their yellow flame.

<p/>The watering on the satin gown shimmered white as moonlight. Emma was
lost beneath it; and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) that, spreading beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own
self, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) blended confusedly with everything around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--the silence,
the night, the passing wind, the damp odours rising from the ground.

<p/>Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the garden at Tostes, on a bench against the
thorn hedge, or else at Rouen in the streets, on the threshold of their
house, in the yard at Bertaux. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) again heard the laughter of the happy
boys beneath the apple-trees: the room was filled with the perfume
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dress rustled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arms with a noise like
electricity. The dress was still the same.

<p/>For a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thus recalled all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lost joys, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attitudes,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) movements, the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voice. Upon one fit of despair followed
another, and even others, inexhaustible as the waves of an overflowing
sea.

<p/>A terrible curiosity seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Slowly, with the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fingers,
palpitating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) veil. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) uttered a cry of horror that
awoke the other two.

<p/>They dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) down into the sitting-room. Then Felicite came up to
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cut some off,''  (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div>replied the druggist.

<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not dare to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) himself stepped forward, scissors in
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) trembled so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pierced the skin of the temple in several
places. At last, stiffening himself against emotion, Homais gave two
or three great cuts at random that left white patches amongst that
beautiful black hair.

<p/>The chemist and the cure plunged anew into their occupations, not
without sleeping from time to time, of which they accused each other
reciprocally at each fresh awakening. Then Monsieur Bournisien sprinkled
the room with holy water and Homais threw a little chlorine water on the
floor.

<p/>Felicite had taken care to put on the chest of drawers, for each
of them, a bottle of brandy, some cheese, and a large roll. And the
druggist, who could not hold out any longer, about four in the morning
sighed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word! I should like to take some sustenance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>The priest did not need any persuading; he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) went out to go and say mass,
came back, and then they ate and hobnobbed, giggling a little without
knowing why, stimulated by that vague gaiety that comes upon us after
times of sadness, and at the last glass the priest said to the druggist,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) clapped him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) on the shoulder--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall end by understanding one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>In the passage downstairs they met the undertaker's men, who were coming
in. Then Charles for two hours had to suffer the torture of hearing the
hammer resound against the wood. Next day they lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
oak coffin, that was fitted into the other two; but as the bier was
too large, they had to fill up the gaps with the wool of a mattress. At
last, when the three lids had been planed down, nailed, soldered, it was
placed outside in front of the door; the house was thrown open, and the
people of Yonville began to flock round.

<p/>Old Rouault arrived, and fainted on the Place when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) saw the black
cloth!



<p/>Chapter Ten

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had only received the chemist's letter thirty-six hours after the
event; and, from consideration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) feelings, Homais had so worded it
that it was impossible to make out what it was all about.

<p/>First, the old fellow had fallen as if struck by apoplexy. Next, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not dead, but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might be. At last, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had put
on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) blouse, taken his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat, fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spurs to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) boots, and set
out at full speed; and the whole of the way old Rouault, panting, was
torn by anguish. Once even he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) was obliged to dismount. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) was dizzy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>)
heard voices round about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) felt himself going mad.

<p/>Day broke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) saw three black hens asleep in a tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) shuddered,
horrified at this omen. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) promised the Holy Virgin three chasubles
for the church, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) would go barefooted from the cemetery at
Bertaux to the chapel of Vassonville.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) entered Maromme shouting for the people of the inn, burst open the
door with a thrust of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) shoulder, made for a sack of oats, emptied a
bottle of sweet cider into the manger, and again mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) nag, whose
feet struck fire as it dashed along.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) said to himself that no doubt they would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>); the doctors would
discover some remedy surely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) remembered all the miraculous cures
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had been told about. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) was there;
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) eyes, lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) back in the middle of the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) reined
up, and the hallucination disappeared.

<p/>At Quincampoix, to give himself heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) drank three cups of coffee
one after the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) fancied they had made a mistake in the name in
writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) looked for the letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) pocket, felt it there, but did
not dare to open it.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) began to think it was all a joke; someone's spite, the jest
of some wag; and besides, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) were dead, one would have known it. But
no! There was nothing extraordinary about the country; the sky was blue,
the trees swayed; a flock of sheep passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) saw the village; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) was
seen coming bending forward upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) horse, belabouring it with great
blows, the girths dripping with blood.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had recovered consciousness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) fell, weeping, into Bovary's
arms: <div class="bookquote">``My girl! Emma! my child! tell me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div><p/>The other replied, sobbing, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know! I don't know! It's a curse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>The druggist separated them. <div class="bookquote">``These horrible details are useless. I will
tell this gentleman all about it. Here are the people coming. Dignity!
Come now! Philosophy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor fellow tried to show himself brave, and repeated several times.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes! courage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the old man, <div class="bookquote">``so I will have, by God! I'll go along o' her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
to the end!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The bell began tolling. All was ready; they had to start. And seated in
a stall of the choir, side by side, they saw pass and repass in front of
them continually the three chanting choristers.

<p/>The serpent-player was blowing with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might. Monsieur Bournisien,
in full vestments, was singing in a shrill voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowed before the
tabernacle, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms. Lestiboudois
went about the church with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whalebone stick. The bier stood near the
lectern, between four rows of candles. Charles felt inclined to get up
and put them out.

<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tried to stir himself to a feeling of devotion, to throw himself
into the hope of a future life in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should see her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
imagined to himself she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone on a long journey, far away, for a long
time. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lying there, and that all was over,
that they would lay her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the earth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was seized with a fierce,
gloomy, despairful rage. At times he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) felt nothing more, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enjoyed this lull in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pain, whilst at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reproached
himself for being a wretch.

<p/>The sharp noise of an iron-ferruled stick was heard on the stones,
striking them at irregular intervals. It came from the end of the
church, and stopped short at the lower aisles. A man in a coarse brown
jacket knelt down painfully. It was Hippolyte, the stable-boy at the
<div class="bookquote">``Lion d’Or.''  (<font color='red'><b>the stable-boy</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new leg.

<p/>One of the choristers went round the nave making a collection, and the
coppers chinked one after the other on the silver plate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, make haste! I am in pain!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Bovary/Bovary</b></font>)</div>cried Bovary, angrily throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a
five-franc piece. The churchman thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>churchman</b></font>) with a deep bow.

<p/>They sang, they knelt, they stood up; it was endless! He (<font color='blue'><b>churchman</b></font>) remembered that
once, in the early times, they had been to mass together, and they had
sat down on the other side, on the right, by the wall. The bell began
again. There was a great moving of chairs; the bearers slipped their
three staves under the coffin, and everyone left the church.

<p/>Then Justin appeared at the door of the shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>) suddenly went in again,
pale, staggering.

<p/>People were at the windows to see the procession pass. Charles at the
head walked erect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) affected a brave air, and saluted with a nod those
who, coming out from the lanes or from their doors, stood amidst the
crowd.

<p/>The six men, three on either side, walked slowly, panting a little.
The priests, the choristers, and the two choirboys recited the De
profundis*, and their voices echoed over the fields, rising and falling
with their undulations. Sometimes they disappeared in the windings of
the path; but the great silver cross rose always before the trees.

<p/>*Psalm CXXX.


<p/>The women followed in black cloaks with turned-down hoods; each of them
carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) hands a large lighted candle, and Charles felt himself
growing weaker at this continual repetition of prayers and torches,
beneath this oppressive odour of wax and of cassocks. A fresh breeze was
blowing; the rye and colza were sprouting, little dewdrops trembled at
the roadsides and on the hawthorn hedges. All sorts of joyous sounds
filled the air; the jolting of a cart rolling afar off in the ruts, the
crowing of a cock, repeated again and again, or the gambling of a foal
running away under the apple-trees: The pure sky was fretted with rosy
clouds; a bluish haze rested upon the cots covered with iris. Charles as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) passed recognised each courtyard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) remembered mornings like this,
when, after visiting some patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came out from one and returned to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>The black cloth bestrewn with white beads blew up from time to time,
laying bare the coffin. The tired bearers walked more slowly, and it
advanced with constant jerks, like a boat that pitches with every wave.

<p/>They reached the cemetery. The men went right down to a place in the
grass where a grave was dug. They ranged themselves all round; and while
the priest spoke, the red soil thrown up at the sides kept noiselessly
slipping down at the corners.

<p/>Then when the four ropes were arranged the coffin was placed upon them.
He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) watched it descend; it seemed descending for ever. At last a thud was
heard; the ropes creaked as they were drawn up. Then Bournisien took
the spade handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) by Lestiboudois; with his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) left hand all the
time sprinkling water, with the right he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) vigorously threw in a large
spadeful; and the wood of the coffin, struck by the pebbles, gave forth
that dread sound that seems to us the reverberation of eternity.

<p/>The ecclesiastic passed the holy water sprinkler to his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) neighbour. This
was Homais. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) swung it gravely, then handed it to Charles, who sank to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knees in the earth and threw in handfuls of it, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Adieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lestiboudois</b></font>) kisses; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dragged himself towards the grave, to engulf himself
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lestiboudois</b></font>). They led him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) soon grew calmer, feeling perhaps,
like the others, a vague satisfaction that it was all over.

<p/>Old Rouault on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) way back began quietly smoking a pipe, which Homais
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) innermost conscience thought not quite the thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) also noticed
that Monsieur Binet had not been present, and that Tuvache had <div class="bookquote">``made
off''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Tuvache/Tuvache</b></font>)</div>after mass, and that Theodore, the notary's servant wore a blue
coat, <div class="bookquote">``as if one could not have got a black coat, since that is the
custom, by Jove!''  (<font color='red'><b>the notary</b></font>)</div>And to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) observations with others he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) went from
group to group. They were deploring Emma's death, especially Lheureux,
who had not failed to come to the funeral.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little woman! What a trouble for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The druggist</b></font>)</div><p/>The druggist continued, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know that but for me he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have
committed some fatal attempt upon himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The druggist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a good woman! To think that I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only last Saturday in my
shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't had leisure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>said Homais, <div class="bookquote">``to prepare a few words that I
would have cast upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tomb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles on getting home undressed, and old Rouault put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) blue
blouse. It was a new one, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) had often during the journey wiped
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) eyes on the sleeves, the dye had stained his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) face, and the traces of
tears made lines in the layer of dust that covered it.

<p/>Madame Bovary senior was with them. All three were silent. At last the
old fellow sighed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember, my friend, that I went to Tostes once when you had
just lost your first deceased? I consoled you at that time. I thought of
something to say then, but now--''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>Then, with a loud groan that shook his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
whole chest, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! this is the end for me, do you see! I saw my wife go,
then my son, and now to-day it's my daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wanted to go back at once to Bertaux, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could not sleep
in this house. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) even refused to see his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) granddaughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! It would grieve me too much. Only you'll kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) many times
for me. Good-bye! you're a good fellow! And then I shall never forget
that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thigh. <div class="bookquote">``Never fear, you shall always have
your turkey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) reached the top of the hill he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) turned back, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had turned
once before on the road of Saint-Victor when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>). The
windows of the village were all on fire beneath the slanting rays of the
sun sinking behind the field. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes, and saw
in the horizon an enclosure of walls, where trees here and there formed
black clusters between white stones; then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way at a gentle
trot, for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) nag had gone lame.

<p/>Despite their fatigue, Charles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother stayed very long that
evening talking together. They spoke of the days of the past and of the
future. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would come to live at Yonville; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would keep house for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); they would never part again. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was ingenious and caressing,
rejoicing in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart at gaining once more an affection that had
wandered from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for so many years. Midnight struck. The village as
usual was silent, and Charles, awake, thought always of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>Rodolphe, who, to distract himself, had been rambling about the wood all
day, was sleeping quietly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) chateau, and Leon, down yonder, always
slept.

<p/>There was another who at that hour was not asleep.

<p/>On the grave between the pine-trees a child was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) knees weeping,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) heart, rent by sobs, was beating in the shadow beneath the load
of an immense regret, sweeter than the moon and fathomless as the night.
The gate suddenly grated. It was Lestiboudois; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) came to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
spade, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) had forgotten. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) recognised Justin climbing over the
wall, and at last knew who was the culprit who stole his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) potatoes.



<p/>Chapter Eleven

<p/>The next day Charles had the child brought back. She (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>)
mamma. They told her (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) was away; that she (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) back some
playthings. Berthe spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) again several times, then at last
thought no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>). The child's gaiety broke Bovary's heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
had to bear besides the intolerable consolations of the chemist.

<p/>Money troubles soon began again, Monsieur Lheureux urging on anew his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
friend Vincart, and Charles pledged himself for exorbitant sums; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
would never consent to let the smallest of the things that had belonged
to HER be sold. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother was exasperated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grew even more
angry than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had altogether changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left the house.

<p/>Then everyone began <div class="bookquote">``taking advantage''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Mademoiselle Lempereur
presented a bill for six months' teaching, although Emma had never taken
a lesson -LRB-despite the receipted bill she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had shown Bovary-RRB-; it was an
arrangement between the two women. The man at the circulating library
demanded three years' subscriptions; Mere Rollet claimed the postage due
for some twenty letters, and when Charles asked for an explanation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had the delicacy to reply--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know. It was for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) business affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With every debt he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) paid Charles thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had come to the end of them.
But others followed ceaselessly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent in accounts for professional
attendance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was shown the letters his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife had written. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had
to apologise.

<p/>Felicite now wore Madame Bovary's gowns; not all, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had kept some
of them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went to look at them in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dressing-room, locking
himself up there; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) height, and often Charles, seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from behind, was seized with an illusion, and cried out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, stay, stay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>But at Whitsuntide she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ran away from Yonville, carried off by Theodore,
stealing all that was left of the wardrobe.

<p/>It was about this time that the widow Dupuis had the honour to inform
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>) of the <div class="bookquote">``marriage of Monsieur Leon Dupuis her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) son, notary at Yvetot,
to Mademoiselle Leocadie Leboeuf of Bondeville.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Charles, among the
other congratulations he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), wrote this sentence--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad my poor wife would have been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>One day when, wandering aimlessly about the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had gone up to the
attic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) felt a pellet of fine paper under his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) slipper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) opened it
and read: <div class="bookquote">``Courage, Emma, courage. I would not bring misery into your
life.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>It was Rodolphe's letter, fallen to the ground between the boxes,
where it had remained, and that the wind from the dormer window had just
blown towards the door. And Charles stood, motionless and staring, in
the very same place where, long ago, Emma, in despair, and paler even
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), had thought of dying. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) discovered a small R at the
bottom of the second page. What did this mean? He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) remembered Rodolphe's
attentions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sudden, disappearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) constrained air when they
had met two or three times since. But the respectful tone of the letter
deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they loved one another platonically,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said to himself.

<p/>Besides, Charles was not of those who go to the bottom of things; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
shrank from the proofs, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) vague jealousy was lost in the immensity
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) woe.

<p/>Everyone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought, must have adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); all men assuredly must have
coveted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) seemed but the more beautiful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) for this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was seized with a lasting, furious desire for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), that inflamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
despair, and that was boundless, because it was now unrealisable.

<p/>To please her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) were still living, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
predilections, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ideas; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bought patent leather boots and took to
wearing white cravats. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) put cosmetics on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) moustache, and, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),
signed notes of hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) corrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) from beyond the grave.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was obliged to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) silver piece by piece; next he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sold the
drawing-room furniture. All the rooms were stripped; but the bedroom,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own room, remained as before. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dinner Charles went up
there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pushed the round table in front of the fire, and drew up her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
armchair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sat down opposite it. A candle burnt in one of the gilt
candlesticks. Berthe by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) side was painting prints.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) suffered, poor man, at seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) so badly dressed, with laceless
boots, and the arm-holes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pinafore torn down to the hips; for the
charwoman took no care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was so sweet, so pretty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
little head bent forward so gracefully, letting the dear fair hair fall
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) rosy cheeks, that an infinite joy came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), a happiness
mingled with bitterness, like those ill-made wines that taste of
resin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mended her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) toys, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) puppets from cardboard, or sewed up
half-torn dolls. Then, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes fell upon the workbox, a ribbon lying
about, or even a pin left in a crack of the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) began to dream,
and looked so sad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) became as sad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>No one now came to see them, for Justin had run away to Rouen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Justin</b></font>)
was a grocer's assistant, and the druggist's children saw less and less
of the child, Monsieur Homais not caring, seeing the difference of their
social position, to continue the intimacy.

<p/>The blind man, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been able to cure with the pomade, had
gone back to the hill of Bois-Guillaume, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told the travellers of
the vain attempt of the druggist, to such an extent, that Homais when
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to town hid himself behind the curtains of the <div class="bookquote">``Hirondelle''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to
avoid meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) detested him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and wishing, in the interests of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own reputation, to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all costs, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directed against
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a secret battery, that betrayed the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intellect and the
baseness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vanity. Thus, for six consecutive months, one could read
in the <div class="bookquote">``Fanal de Rouen''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>editorials such as these--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All who bend their steps towards the fertile plains of Picardy have, no
doubt, remarked, by the Bois-Guillaume hill, a wretch suffering from
a horrible facial wound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dupuis</b></font>) importunes, persecutes one, and levies a
regular tax on all travellers. Are we still living in the monstrous
times of the Middle Ages, when vagabonds were permitted to display in
our public places leprosy and scrofulas they had brought back from the
Crusades?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Or--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In spite of the laws against vagabondage, the approaches to our great
towns continue to be infected by bands of beggars. Some are seen going
about alone, and these are not, perhaps, the least dangerous. What are
our ediles about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Homais invented anecdotes--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday, by the Bois-Guillaume hill, a skittish horse--''  (<font color='red'><b>Homais/Monsieur Homais</b></font>)</div>And then
followed the story of an accident caused by the presence of the blind
man.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) managed so well that the fellow was locked up. But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was released.
He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) began again, and Homais began again. It was a struggle. Homais won
it, for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) foe was condemned to life-long confinement in an asylum.

<p/>This success emboldened him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and henceforth there was no longer a dog
run over, a barn burnt down, a woman beaten in the parish, of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not immediately inform the public, guided always by the love of
progress and the hate of priests. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) instituted comparisons between the
elementary and clerical schools to the detriment of the latter; called
to mind the massacre of St. Bartholomew a propos of a grant of one
hundred francs to the church, and denounced abuses, aired new views.
That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) phrase. Homais was digging and delving; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) was becoming
dangerous.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) was stifling in the narrow limits of journalism, and soon a
book, a work was necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) composed <div class="bookquote">``General Statistics
of the Canton of Yonville, followed by Climatological Remarks.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
statistics drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) to philosophy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) busied himself with great
questions: the social problem, moralisation of the poorer classes,
pisciculture, caoutchouc, railways, etc.. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) even began to blush at being
a bourgeois. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) affected the artistic style, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) smoked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) bought two
chic Pompadour statuettes to adorn his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) drawing-room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) by no means gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) shop. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) kept well abreast
of new discoveries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) followed the great movement of chocolates; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>)
was the first to introduce <div class="bookquote">``cocoa''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``revalenta''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>into the
Seine-Inferieure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) was enthusiastic about the hydro-electric
Pulvermacher chains; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) wore one himself, and when at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) took off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) flannel vest, Madame Homais stood quite dazzled before the golden
spiral beneath which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) was hidden, and felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) ardour redouble for
this man more bandaged than a Scythian, and splendid as one of the Magi.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) had fine ideas about Emma's tomb. First he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) proposed a broken column
with some drapery, next a pyramid, then a Temple of Vesta, a sort of
rotunda, or else a <div class="bookquote">``mass of ruins.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) plans Homais always
stuck to the weeping willow, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) looked upon as the indispensable
symbol of sorrow.

<p/>Charles and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made a journey to Rouen together to look at some tombs
at a funeral furnisher's, accompanied by an artist, one Vaufrylard, a
friend of Bridoux's, who made puns all the time. At last, after having
examined some hundred designs, having ordered an estimate and made
another journey to Rouen, Charles decided in favour of a mausoleum,
which on the two principal sides was to have a <div class="bookquote">``spirit bearing an
extinguished torch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>As to the inscription, Homais could think of nothing so fine as Sta
viator*, and he (<font color='blue'><b>viator</b></font>) got no further; he (<font color='blue'><b>viator</b></font>) racked his (<font color='blue'><b>viator</b></font>) brain, he (<font color='blue'><b>viator</b></font>) constantly
repeated Sta viator. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>viator</b></font>) hit upon Amabilen conjugem calcas**,
which was adopted.

<p/>* Rest traveler.

<p/>** Tread upon a loving wife.

<p/>A strange thing was that Bovary, while continually thinking of Emma, was
forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) grew desperate as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) felt this image fading from his (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>)
memory in spite of all efforts to retain it. Yet every night he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) dreamt
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); it was always the same dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) drew near her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), but when he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) was
about to clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell into decay in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) arms.

<p/>For a week he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) was seen going to church in the evening. Monsieur
Bournisien even paid him (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) two or three visits, then gave him (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) up.
Moreover, the old fellow was growing intolerant, fanatic, said Homais.
He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thundered against the spirit of the age, and never failed, every
other week, in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sermon, to recount the death agony of Voltaire, who
died devouring his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) excrements, as everyone knows.

<p/>In spite of the economy with which Bovary lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was far from being
able to pay off his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) old debts. Lheureux refused to renew any more
bills. A distraint became imminent. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother, who
consented to let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) take a mortgage on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) property, but with a great
many recriminations against Emma; and in return for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sacrifice she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
asked for a shawl that had escaped the depredations of Felicite. Charles
refused to give it her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); they quarrelled.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made the first overtures of reconciliation by offering to have the
little girl, who could help her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the house, to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Charles
consented to this, but when the time for parting came, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) courage
failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Then there was a final, complete rupture.

<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) affections vanished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) clung more closely to the love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) anxious, however, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) coughed sometimes, and had
red spots on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/>Opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) house, flourishing and merry, was the family of the
chemist, with whom everything was prospering. Napoleon helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) in the
laboratory, Athalie embroidered him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) a skullcap, Irma cut out rounds of
paper to cover the preserves, and Franklin recited Pythagoras' table in
a breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) was the happiest of fathers, the most fortunate of men.

<p/>Not so! A secret ambition devoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>). Homais hankered after the cross
of the Legion of Honour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) had plenty of claims to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First, having at the time of the cholera distinguished myself by a
boundless devotion; second, by having published, at my expense,
various works of public utility, such as''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) pamphlet
entitled, <div class="bookquote">``Cider, its manufacture and effects,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>besides observation
on the lanigerous plant-louse, sent to the Academy; his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) volume of
statistics, and down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) pharmaceutical thesis-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``without counting
that I am a member of several learned societies''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) was member of a
single one-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In short!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) cried, making a pirouette, <div class="bookquote">``if it were only for
distinguishing myself at fires!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Homais inclined towards the Government. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) secretly did the
prefect great service during the elections. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) sold himself--in a word,
prostituted himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) even addressed a petition to the sovereign
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``do him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) justice'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``our good
king,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and compared him (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) to Henri IV.

<p/>And every morning the druggist rushed for the paper to see if his (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>)
nomination were in it. It was never there. At last, unable to bear it
any longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) had a grass plot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) garden designed to represent the
Star of the Cross of Honour with two little strips of grass running from
the top to imitate the ribband. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) walked round it with folded arms,
meditating on the folly of the Government and the ingratitude of men.

<p/>From respect, or from a sort of sensuality that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) carry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>)
investigations slowly, Charles had not yet opened the secret drawer of
a rosewood desk which Emma had generally used. One day, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
sat down before it, turned the key, and pressed the spring. All Leon's
letters were there. There could be no doubt this time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) devoured them
to the very last, ransacked every corner, all the furniture, all the
drawers, behind the walls, sobbing, crying aloud, distraught, mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
found a box and broke it open with a kick. Rodolphe's portrait flew full
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) face in the midst of the overturned love-letters.

<p/>People wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) despondency. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) never went out, saw no one,
refused even to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) patients. Then they said <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shut himself up
to drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>some person</b></font>)</div><p/>Sometimes, however, some curious person climbed on to the garden hedge,
and saw with amazement this long-bearded, shabbily clothed, wild man,
who wept aloud as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked up and down.

<p/>In the evening in summer he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little girl with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and led her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to
the cemetery. They came back at nightfall, when the only light left in
the Place was that in Binet's window.

<p/>The voluptuousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grief was, however, incomplete, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no
one near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to share it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paid visits to Madame Lefrancois to be
able to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>But the landlady only listened with half an ear, having troubles
like himself. For Lheureux had at last established the <div class="bookquote">``Favorites du
Commerce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lheureux/Monsieur Lheureux</b></font>)</div>and Hivert, who enjoyed a great reputation for doing errands,
insisted on a rise of wages, and was threatening to go over <div class="bookquote">``to the
opposition shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hivert</b></font>)</div><p/>One day when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone to the market at Argueil to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
last resource--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met Rodolphe.

<p/>They both turned pale when they caught sight of one another. Rodolphe,
who had only sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) card, first stammered some apologies, then grew
bolder, and even pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) assurance -LRB-it was in the month of August and
very hot-RRB- to the length of inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) to have a bottle of beer at the
public-house.

<p/>Leaning on the table opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) chewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) cigar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) talked, and
Charles was lost in reverie at this face that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had loved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) seemed
to see again something of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in it. It was a marvel to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would
have liked to have been this man.

<p/>The other went on talking agriculture, cattle, pasturage, filling out
with banal phrases all the gaps where an allusion might slip in. Charles
was not listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); Rodolphe noticed it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) followed the
succession of memories that crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) face. This gradually grew
redder; the nostrils throbbed fast, the lips quivered. There was at
last a moment when Charles, full of a sombre fury, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes on
Rodolphe, who, in something of fear, stopped talking. But soon the same
look of weary lassitude came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't blame you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) said.

<p/>Rodolphe was dumb. And Charles, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands, went on in a
broken voice, and with the resigned accent of infinite sorrow--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't blame you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) even added a fine phrase, the only one he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ever made--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the fault of fatality!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rodolphe, who had managed the fatality, thought the remark very offhand
from a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodolphe</b></font>) position, comic even, and a little mean.

<p/>The next day Charles went to sit down on the seat in the arbour. Rays
of light were straying through the trellis, the vine leaves threw their
shadows on the sand, the jasmines perfumed the air, the heavens were
blue, Spanish flies buzzed round the lilies in bloom, and Charles was
suffocating like a youth beneath the vague love influences that filled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) aching heart.

<p/>At seven o’clock little Berthe, who had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) all the afternoon,
went to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to dinner.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head was thrown back against the wall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes closed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mouth
open, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand was a long tress of black hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said.

<p/>And thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted to play; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fell to the
ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was dead.

<p/>Thirty-six hours after, at the druggist's request, Monsieur Canivet came
thither. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made a post-mortem and found nothing.

<p/>When everything had been sold, twelve francs seventy-five centimes
remained, that served to pay for Mademoiselle Bovary's going to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grandmother. The good woman died the same year; old Rouault was
paralysed, and it was an aunt who took charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is poor, and
sends her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to a cotton-factory to earn a living.

<p/>Since Bovary's death three doctors have followed one another at Yonville
without any success, so severely did Homais attack them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) has an
enormous practice; the authorities treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) with consideration, and
public opinion protects him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouault</b></font>) has just received the cross of the Legion of Honour.
