estimate of what might be expected from Hetty in the way of
feeling, and in moments of indignation she had sometimes spoken
with great openness on the subject to her husband.
“She’s no better than a peacock, as ’ud strut about on the wall
and spread its tail when the sun shone if all the folks i’ the parish
was dying: there’s nothing seems to give her a turn i’ th’ inside,
not even when we thought Totty had tumbled into the pit. To
