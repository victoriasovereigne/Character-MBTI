she was a beggar-woman, only for her good clothes. I thought she
looked a bit crazy, but it was no business of mine. I stood and
looked back after her, but she went right on while she was in sight.
I had to go to the other side of the coppice to look after some
stakes. There’s a road right through it, and bits of openings here
and there, where the trees have been cut down, and some of ’em
not carried away. I didn’t go straight along the road, but turned off
towards the middle, and took a shorter way towards the spot I
wanted to get to. I hadn’t got far out of the road into one of the
open places before I heard a strange cry. I thought it didn’t come
from any animal I knew, but I wasn’t for stopping to look about
just then. But it went on, and seemed so strange to me in that
place, I couldn’t help stopping to look. I began to think I might
make some money of it, if it was a new thing. But I had hard work
to tell which way it came from, and for a good while I kept looking
up at the boughs. And then I thought it came from the ground; and
there was a lot of timber-choppings lying about, and loose pieces
of turf, and a trunk or two. And I looked about among them, but
could find nothing, and at last the cry stopped. So I was for giving
it up, and I went on about my business. But when I came back the
same way pretty nigh an hour after, I couldn’t help laying down
my stakes to have another look. And just as I was stooping and
laying down the stakes, I saw something odd and round and
whitish lying on the ground under a nut-bush by the side of me.
And I stooped down on hands and knees to pick it up. And I saw it
was a little baby’s hand.”
At these words a thrill ran through the court. Hetty was visibly
trembling; now, for the first time, she seemed to be listening to
what a witness said.
