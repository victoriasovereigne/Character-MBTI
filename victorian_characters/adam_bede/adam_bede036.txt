Poyser has spoken her mind pretty strongly as to the dirt which
the extra number of men’s shoes brought into the house at
dinnertime. Indeed, she has not yet recovered her equanimity on
the subject, though it is now nearly three hours since dinner, and
the house-floor is perfectly clean again; as clean as everything else
