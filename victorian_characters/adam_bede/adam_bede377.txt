Before ten o’clock on Thursday morning the home at the Hall
Farm was a house of mourning for a misfortune felt to be worse
than death. The sense of family dishonour was too keen even in
the kind-hearted Martin Poyser the younger to leave room for any
compassion towards Hetty. He and his father were simple-minded
farmers, proud of their untarnished character, proud that they
came of a family which had held up its head and paid its way as far
back as its name was in the parish register; and Hetty had brought
disgrace on them all—disgrace that could never be wiped out.
That was the all-conquering feeling in the mind both of father and
son—the scorching sense of disgrace, which neutralised all other
sensibility—and Mr. Irwine was struck with surprise to observe
that Mrs. Poyser was less severe than her husband. We are often
startled by the severity of mild people on exceptional occasions;
the reason is, that mild people are most liable to be under the yoke
of traditional impressions.
“I’m willing to pay any money as is wanted towards trying to
bring her off,” said Martin the younger when Mr. Irwine was gone,
while the old grandfather was crying in the opposite chair, “but I’ll
not go nigh her, nor ever see her again, by my own will. She’s
made our bread bitter to us for all our lives to come, an’ we shall
ne’er hold up our heads i’ this parish nor i’ any other. The parson
talks o’ folks pitying us: it’s poor amends pity ’ull make us.”
“Pity?” said the grandfather, sharply. “I ne’er wanted folks’s
pity i’ my life afore . . . an’ I mun begin to be looked down on now,
an’ me turned seventy-two last St. Thomas’s, an’ all th’ underbearers and pall-bearers as I’n picked for my funeral are i’ this
parish and the next to ’t . . . It’s o’ no use now . . . I mun be ta’en to
the grave by strangers.”
