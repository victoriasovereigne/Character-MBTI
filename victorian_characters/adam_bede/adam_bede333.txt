nature of innkeepers and all men who have no pressing business
of their own to ask as many questions as possible before giving any
information.
“I want to see a gentleman as is there,” said Hetty.
“But there’s no gentleman there,” returned the landlord. “It’s
shut up—been shut up this fortnight. What gentleman is it you
want? Perhaps I can let you know where to find him.”
“It’s Captain Donnithorne,” said Hetty tremulously, her heart
beginning to beat painfully at this disappointment of her hope that
she should find Arthur at once.
“Captain Donnithorne? Stop a bit,” said the landlord, slowly.
“Was he in the Loamshire Militia? A tall young officer with a
fairish skin and reddish whiskers—and had a servant by the name
o’ Pym?”
“Oh yes,” said Hetty; “you know him—where is he?”
“A fine sight o’ miles away from here. The Loamshire Militia’s
gone to Ireland; it’s been gone this fortnight.”
“Look there! She’s fainting,” said the landlady, hastening to
support Hetty, who had lost her miserable consciousness and
looked like a beautiful corpse. They carried her to the sofa and
loosened her dress.
“Here’s a bad business, I suspect,” said the landlord, as he
brought in some water.
“Ah, it’s plain enough what sort of business it is,” said the wife.
“She’s not a common flaunting dratchell, I can see that. She looks
like a respectable country girl, and she comes from a good way off,
to judge by her tongue. She talks something like that ostler we had
that come from the north. He was as honest a fellow as we ever
had about the house—they’re all honest folks in the north.”
