long, lonely journey, with sadness in the heart; away from
the familiar to the strange: that is a hard and dreary thing
even to the rich, the strong, the instructed; a hard thing,
even when we are called by duty, not urged by dread.
What was it then to Hetty? With her poor narrow thoughts, no
longer melting into vague hopes, but pressed upon by the chill of
definite fear, repeating again and again the same small round of

images of what was to come—seeing nothing in this wide world
but the little history of her own pleasures and pains; with so little
money in her pocket, and the way so long and difficult. Unless she
could afford always to go in the coaches—and she felt sure she
could not, for the journey to Stoniton was more expensive than
she had expected—it was plain that she must trust to carriers’
carts or slow waggons; and what a time it would be before she
could get to the end of her journey! The burly old coachman from
Oakbourne, seeing such a pretty young woman among the outside
passengers, had invited her to come and sit beside him; and
feeling that it became him as a man and a coachman to open the
dialogue with a joke, he applied himself as soon as they were off
the stones to the elaboration of one suitable in all respects. After
many cuts with his whip and glances at Hetty out of the corner of
his eye, he lifted his lips above the edge of his wrapper and said,
