reached the opposite gate, and felt her way along its rails and the
rails of the sheep-fold, till her hand encountered the pricking of
the gorsy wall. Delicious sensation! She had found the shelter. She
groped her way, touching the prickly gorse, to the door, and
pushed it open. It was an ill-smelling close place, but warm, and
there was straw on the ground. Hetty sank down on the straw with
a sense of escape. Tears came—she had never shed tears before
since she left Windsor—tears and sobs of hysterical joy that she
had still hold of life, that she was still on the familiar earth, with
the sheep near her. The very consciousness of her own limbs was
a delight to her: she turned up her sleeves, and kissed her arms
with the passionate love of life. Soon warmth and weariness lulled
her in the midst of her sobs, and she fell continually into dozing,
fancying herself at the brink of the pool again—fancying that she
had jumped into the water, and then awaking with a start, and
wondering where she was. But at last deep dreamless sleep came;
her head, guarded by her bonnet, found a pillow against the gorsy
wall, and the poor soul, driven to and fro between two equal
terrors, found the one relief that was possible to it—the relief of
unconsciousness.
Alas! That relief seems to end the moment it has begun. It
seemed to Hetty as if those dozen dreams had only passed into
another dream—that she was in the hovel, and her aunt was
standing over her with a candle in her hand. She trembled under
her aunt’s glance, and opened her eyes. There was no candle, but
there was light in the hovel—the light of early morning through
the open door. And there was a face looking down on her; but it
was an unknown face, belonging to an elderly man in a smockfrock.
