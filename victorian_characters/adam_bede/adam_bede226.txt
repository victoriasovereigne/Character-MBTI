The “bit of womanhood” was our old acquaintance Bessy
Cranage, otherwise Chad’s Bess, whose large red cheeks and
blowsy person had undergone an exaggeration of colour, which, if
she had happened to be a heavenly body, would have made her
sublime. Bessy, I am sorry to say, had taken to her ear-rings again
since Dinah’s departure, and was otherwise decked out in such
small finery as she could muster. Any one who could have looked
into poor Bessy’s heart would have seen a striking resemblance
between her little hopes and anxieties and Hetty’s. The advantage,
perhaps, would have been on Bessy’s side in the matter of feeling.
But then, you see, they were so very different outside! You would
have been inclined to box Bessy’s ears, and you would have longed
to kiss Hetty.
Bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race, partly from
mere hedonish gaiety, partly because of the prize. Some one had
said there were to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes, and
she approached the marquee, fanning herself with her
handkerchief, but with exultation sparkling in her round eyes.
“Here is the prize for the first sack-race,” said Miss Lydia,
taking a large parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and
giving it to Mrs. Irwine before Bessy came up, “an excellent
grogram gown and a piece of flannel.”
“You didn’t think the winner was to be so young, I suppose,
Aunt?” said Arthur. “Couldn’t you find something else for this girl,
and save that grim-looking gown for one of the older women?”
“I have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial,” said
Miss Lydia, adjusting her own lace; “I should not think of
encouraging a love of finery in young women of that class. I have a
scarlet cloak, but that is for the old woman who wins.”
