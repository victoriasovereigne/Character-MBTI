trying to hide the truth. God’s love and mercy can overcome all
things—our ignorance, and weakness, and all the burden of our
past wickedness—all things but our wilful sin, sin that we cling to,
and will not give up. You believe in my love and pity for you,
Hetty, but if you had not let me come near you, if you wouldn’t
have looked at me or spoken to me, you’d have shut me out from
helping you. I couldn’t have made you feel my love; I couldn’t have
told you what I felt for you. Don’t shut God’s love out in that way,
by clinging to sin . . . He can’t bless you while you have one
falsehood in your soul; his pardoning mercy can’t reach you until
you open your heart to him, and say, ‘I have done this great
wickedness; O God, save me, make me pure from sin.’ While you
cling to one sin and will not part with it, it must drag you down to
misery after death, as it has dragged you to misery here in this
world, my poor, poor Hetty. It is sin that brings dread, and
darkness, and despair: there is light and blessedness for us as soon
as we cast it off. God enters our souls then, and teaches us, and
brings us strength and peace. Cast it off now, Hetty—now: confess
the wickedness you have done—the sin you have been guilty of
against your Heavenly Father. Let us kneel down together, for we
are in the presence of God.”
Hetty obeyed Dinah’s movement, and sank on her knees. They
still held each other’s hands, and there was long silence. Then
Dinah said, “Hetty, we are before God. He is waiting for you to tell
the truth.”
Still there was silence. At last Hetty spoke, in a tone of
beseeching—
“Dinah . . . help me . . . I can’t feel anything like you . . . my
heart is hard.”
