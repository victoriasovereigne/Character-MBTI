“Why, what do you do here, young woman?” the man said
roughly.
Hetty trembled still worse under this real fear and shame than
she had done in her momentary dream under her aunt’s glance.
She felt that she was like a beggar already—found sleeping in that
place. But in spite of her trembling, she was so eager to account to
the man for her presence here, that she found words at once.
“I lost my way,” she said. “I’m travelling—north’ard, and I got
away from the road into the fields, and was overtaken by the dark.
Will you tell me the way to the nearest village?”
She got up as she was speaking, and put her hands to her
bonnet to adjust it, and then laid hold of her basket.
The man looked at her with a slow bovine gaze, without giving
her any answer, for some seconds. Then he turned away and
walked towards the door of the hovel, but it was not till he got
there that he stood still, and, turning his shoulder half-round
towards her, said, “Aw, I can show you the way to Norton, if you
like. But what do you do gettin’ out o’ the highroad?” he added,
with a tone of gruff reproof. “Y’ull be gettin’ into mischief, if you
dooant mind.”
“Yes,” said Hetty, “I won’t do it again. I’ll keep in the road, if
you’ll be so good as show me how to get to it.”
“Why dooant you keep where there’s a finger-poasses an’ folks
to ax the way on?” the man said, still more gruffly. “Anybody ’ud
think you was a wild woman, an’ look at yer.”
Hetty was frightened at this gruff old man, and still more at this
last suggestion that she looked like a wild woman. As she followed
him out of the hovel she thought she would give him a sixpence for
telling her the way, and then he would not suppose she was wild.
