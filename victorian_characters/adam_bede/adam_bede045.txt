himself, and thinking how her husband would be interested in
hearing her recount this remarkable specimen of high-born
humour. The captain was thought to be “very full of his jokes,”
and was a great favourite throughout the estate on account of his
free manners. Every tenant was quite sure things would be
different when the reins got into his hands—there was to be a
millennial abundance of new gates, allowances of lime, and
returns of ten per cent.
“But where is Totty to-day?” he said. “I want to see her.”
“Where is the little un, Hetty?” said Mrs. Poyser. “She came in
here not long ago.”
“I don’t know. She went into the brewhouse to Nancy, I think.”
The proud mother, unable to resist the temptation to show her
Totty, passed at once into the back kitchen, in search of her, not,
however, without misgivings lest something should have
happened to render her person and attire unfit for presentation.
“And do you carry the butter to market when you’ve made it?”
said the Captain to Hetty, meanwhile.
“Oh no, sir; not when it’s so heavy. I’m not strong enough to
carry it. Alick takes it on horseback.”
“No, I’m sure your pretty arms were never meant for such
heavy weights. But you go out a walk sometimes these pleasant
evenings, don’t you? Why don’t you have a walk in the Chase
sometimes, now it’s so green and pleasant? I hardly ever see you
anywhere except at home and at church.”
“Aunt doesn’t like me to go a-walking only when I’m going
somewhere,” said Hetty. “But I go through the Chase sometimes.”
“And don’t you ever go to see Mrs. Best, the housekeeper? I
think I saw you once in the housekeeper’s room.”
