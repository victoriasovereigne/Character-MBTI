know, for when I got up and went out of the barn, I didn’t know
whether it was night or morning. But it was morning, for it kept
getting lighter, and I turned back the way I’d come. I couldn’t help
it, Dinah; it was the baby’s crying made me go—and yet I was
frightened to death. I thought that man in the smock-frock ’ud see
me and know I put the baby there. But I went on, for all that. I’d
left off thinking about going home—it had gone out o’ my mind. I
saw nothing but that place in the wood where I’d buried the baby .
. . I see it now. Oh Dinah! shall I allays see it?”
Hetty clung round Dinah and shuddered again. The silence
seemed long before she went on.
“I met nobody, for it was very early, and I got into the wood . . .
I knew the way to the place . . . the place against the nut-tree; and
I could hear it crying at every step . . . I thought it was alive . . . I
don’t know whether I was frightened or glad . . . I don’t know what
I felt. I only know I was in the wood and heard the cry. I don’t
know what I felt till I saw the baby was gone. And when I’d put it
there, I thought I should like somebody to find it and save it from
dying; but when I saw it was gone, I was struck like a stone, with
fear. I never thought o’ stirring, I felt so weak. I knew I couldn’t
run away, and everybody as saw me ’ud know about the baby. My
heart went like a stone. I couldn’t wish or try for anything; it
seemed like as if I should stay there for ever, and nothing ’ud ever
change. But they came and took me away.”
Hetty was silent, but she shuddered again, as if there was still
something behind; and Dinah waited, for her heart was so full that
tears must come before words. At last Hetty burst out, with a sob,
“Dinah, do you think God will take away that crying and the place
in the wood, now I’ve told everything?”
