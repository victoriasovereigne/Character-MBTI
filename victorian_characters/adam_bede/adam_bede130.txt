Arthur winced under this speech, for keen old Mrs. Irwine’s
opinion about him had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen.
This, to be sure, was only another reason for persevering in his
intention, and getting an additional security against himself.
Nevertheless, at this point in the conversation, he was conscious of
increased disinclination to tell his story about Hetty. He was of an
impressible nature, and lived a great deal in other people’s
opinions and feelings concerning himself; and the mere fact that
he was in the presence of an intimate friend, who had not the
slightest notion that he had had any such serious internal struggle
as he came to confide, rather shook his own belief in the
seriousness of the struggle. It was not, after all, a thing to make a
fuss about; and what could Irwine do for him that he could not do
for himself? He would go to Eagledale in spite of Meg’s lameness—
go on Rattler, and let Pym follow as well as he could on the old
hack. That was his thought as he sugared his coffee; but the next
minute, as he was lifting the cup to his lips, he remembered how
thoroughly he had made up his mind last night to tell Irwine. No!
He would not be vacillating again—he would do what he had
meant to do, this time. So it would be well not to let the personal
tone of the conversation altogether drop. If they went to quite
indifferent topics, his difficulty would be heightened. It had
required no noticeable pause for this rush and rebound of feeling,
before he answered, “But I think it is hardly an argument against
a man’s general strength of character that he should be apt to be
mastered by love. A fine constitution doesn’t insure one against
smallpox or any other of those inevitable diseases. A man may be
very firm in other matters and yet be under a sort of witchery from
a woman.”
