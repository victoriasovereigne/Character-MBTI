looking round at the apple-cheeked children. “My aunt and the
Miss Irwines will come up and see you presently. They were afraid
of the noise of the toasts, but it would be a shame for them not to
see you at table.”
He walked on, speaking to the mothers and patting the
children, while Mr. Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and
nodding at a distance, that no one’s attention might be disturbed
from the young squire, the hero of the day. Arthur did not venture
to stop near Hetty, but merely bowed to her as he passed along the
opposite side. The foolish child felt her heart swelling with
discontent; for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent
neglect, even when she knows it to be the mask of love? Hetty
thought this was going to be the most miserable day she had had
for a long while, a moment of chill daylight and reality came across
her dream: Arthur, who had seemed so near to her only a few
hours before, was separated from her, as the hero of a great
procession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd.
