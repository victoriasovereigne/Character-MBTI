Hall Farm and tell them the news. Mr. Poyser, he knew, would like
it better than a five-pound note, and he should see if Hettyâ€™s eyes
brightened at it. The months would be short with all he had to fill
his mind, and this foolish eagerness which had come over him of
late must not hurry him into any premature words. Yet when he
got home and told his mother the good news, and ate his supper,
while she sat by almost crying for joy and wanting him to eat twice
as much as usual because of this good-luck, he could not help
preparing her gently for the coming change by talking of the old
house being too small for them all to go on living in it always.
