down to a little way below the elbow—they were white and plump,
and dimpled to match her cheeks; but towards the wrist, she

in a brocaded silk, with feathers in her hair, and her dress
sweeping the ground, like Miss Lydia and Lady Dacey, when she
saw them going into the dining-room one evening as she peeped
