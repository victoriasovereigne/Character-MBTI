wardrobe. She feels the bracelets on her arms, and treads on a soft
carpet in front of a tall mirror. But she has one thing in the drawer
which she can venture to wear to-day, because she can hang it on
the chain of dark-brown berries which she has been used to wear
on grand days, with a tiny flat scent-bottle at the end of it tucked
inside her frock; and she must put on her brown berries—her neck
would look so unfinished without it. Hetty was not quite as fond of
the locket as of the ear-rings, though it was a handsome large
locket, with enamelled flowers at the back and a beautiful gold
border round the glass, which showed a light-brown slightly
waving lock, forming a background for two little dark rings. She
must keep it under her clothes, and no one would see it. But Hetty
had another passion, only a little less strong than her love of
finery, and that other passion made her like to wear the locket
even hidden in her bosom. She would always have worn it, if she
had dared to encounter her aunt’s questions about a ribbon round

edge of her frock. And now she had nothing to do but to put on her
long sleeves, her new white gauze neckerchief, and her straw hat
trimmed with white to-day instead of the pink, which had become
rather faded under the July sun. That hat made the drop of

everybody would see that it was a little tanned against the white
ribbon—and Mary Burge, she felt sure, would have a new hat or
bonnet on. She looked for consolation at her fine white cotton
stockings: they really were very nice indeed, and she had given
almost all her spare money for them. Hetty’s dream of the future
