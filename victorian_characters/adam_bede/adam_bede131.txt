otherwise.”
“Why, yes, a man can’t very well steal a bank-note unless the
bank-note lies within convenient reach; but he won’t make us
think him an honest man because he begins to howl at the banknote for falling in his way.”
“But surely you don’t think a man who struggles against a
temptation into which he falls at last as bad as the man who never
struggles at all?”
“No, certainly; I pity him in proportion to his struggles, for they
foreshadow the inward suffering which is the worst form of
Nemesis. Consequences are unpitying. Our deeds carry their
terrible consequences, quite apart from any fluctuations that went
before—consequences that are hardly ever confined to ourselves.
And it is best to fix our minds on that certainty, instead of
considering what may be the elements of excuse for us. But I
never knew you so inclined for moral discussion, Arthur? Is it
some danger of your own that you are considering in this
philosophical, general way?”
In asking this question, Mr. Irwine pushed his plate away,
threw himself back in his chair, and looked straight at Arthur. He
really suspected that Arthur wanted to tell him something, and
thought of smoothing the way for him by this direct question. But
he was mistaken. Brought suddenly and involuntarily to the brink
of confession, Arthur shrank back and felt less disposed towards it
than ever. The conversation had taken a more serious tone than
he had intended—it would quite mislead Irwine—he would
imagine there was a deep passion for Hetty, while there was no
such thing. He was conscious of colouring, and was annoyed at his
boyishness.
