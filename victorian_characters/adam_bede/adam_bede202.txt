like it before; and he had wrapped the box up in a great many
covers, that he might see Hetty unwrapping it with growing
curiosity, till at last her eyes flashed back their new delight into
his.
No, she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at
the ear-rings, for now she is taking them out of the box, not to
