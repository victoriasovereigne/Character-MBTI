more unmistakable guidance than those inward voices. There was
light enough for her, if she opened her Bible, to discern the text
sufficiently to know what it would say to her. She knew the
physiognomy of every page, and could tell on what book she
opened, sometimes on what chapter, without seeing title or
number. It was a small thick Bible, worn quite round at the edges.
Dinah laid it sideways on the window ledge, where the light was
strongest, and then opened it with her forefinger. The first words
she looked at were those at the top of the left-hand page: “And
they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him.” That
was enough for Dinah; she had opened on that memorable parting
at Ephesus, when Paul had felt bound to open his heart in a last
exhortation and warning. She hesitated no longer, but, opening
her own door gently, went and tapped on Hetty’s. We know she
had to tap twice, because Hetty had to put out her candles and
throw off her black lace scarf; but after the second tap the door
was opened immediately. Dinah said, “Will you let me come in,
Hetty?” and Hetty, without speaking, for she was confused and
vexed, opened the door wider and let her in.
What a strange contrast the two figures made, visible enough in
that mingled twilight and moonlight! Hetty, her cheeks flushed
and her eyes glistening from her imaginary drama, her beautiful
neck and arms bare, her hair hanging in a curly tangle down her
back, and the baubles in her ears. Dinah, covered with her long
white dress, her pale face full of subdued emotion, almost like a
lovely corpse into which the soul has returned charged with
sublimer secrets and a sublimer love. They were nearly of the
same height; Dinah evidently a little the taller as she put her arm
round Hetty’s waist and kissed her forehead.
