excitable state of mind in which there is no calculating what turn
the feelings may take from one moment to another, and for the
first time she became irritated under Dinah’s caress. She pushed
her away impatiently, and said, with a childish sobbing voice,
“Don’t talk to me so, Dinah. Why do you come to frighten me? I’ve
never done anything to you. Why can’t you let me be?”
Poor Dinah felt a pang. She was too wise to persist, and only
said mildly, “Yes, my dear, you’re tired; I won’t hinder you any
longer. Make haste and get into bed. Good-night.”
She went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she
had been a ghost; but once by the side of her own bed, she threw
herself on her knees and poured out in deep silence all the
passionate pity that filled her heart.
As for Hetty, she was soon in the wood again—her waking
dreams being merged in a sleeping life scarcely more fragmentary
and confused.
