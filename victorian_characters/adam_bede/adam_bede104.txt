from the corner. Mrs. Poyser then led the way out of the kitchen,
followed by the grandfather, and Dinah with Totty in her arms—
all going to bed by twilight, like the birds. Mrs. Poyser, on her way,
peeped into the room where her two boys lay; just to see their
ruddy round cheeks on the pillow, and to hear for a moment their
light regular breathing.
“Come, Hetty, get to bed,” said Mr. Poyser, in a soothing tone,
as he himself turned to go upstairs. “You didna mean to be late, I’ll
be bound, but your aunt’s been worrited to-day. Good-night, my
wench, good-night.”
