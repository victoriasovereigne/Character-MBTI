was rescued and taken to the parish. “The parish!” You can
perhaps hardly understand the effect of that word on a mind like
Hetty’s, brought up among people who were somewhat hard in
their feelings even towards poverty, who lived among the fields,
and had little pity for want and rags as a cruel inevitable fate such
as they sometimes seem in cities, but held them a mark of idleness
and vice—and it was idleness and vice that brought burdens on
the parish. To Hetty the “parish” was next to the prison in
obloquy, and to ask anything of strangers—to beg—lay in the same
far-off hideous region of intolerable shame that Hetty had all her
life thought it impossible she could ever come near. But now the
remembrance of that wretched woman whom she had seen
herself, on her way from church, being carried into Joshua Rann’s,
came back upon her with the new terrible sense that there was
very little now to divide her from the same lot. And the dread of
bodily hardship mingled with the dread of shame; for Hetty had
the luxurious nature of a round soft-coated pet animal.
How she yearned to be back in her safe home again, cherished
and cared for as she had always been! Her aunt’s scolding about
trifles would have been music to her ears now; she longed for it;
she used to hear it in a time when she had only trifles to hide.
Could she be the same Hetty that used to make up the butter in
the dairy with the gueldre roses peeping in at the window—she, a
runaway whom her friends would not open their doors to again,
lying in this strange bed, with the knowledge that she had no
money to pay for what she received, and must offer those
strangers some of the clothes in her basket? It was then she
thought of her locket and ear-rings, and seeing her pocket lie near,
she reached it and spread the contents on the bed before her.
