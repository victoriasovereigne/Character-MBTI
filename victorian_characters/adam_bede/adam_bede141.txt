while her husband was speaking, “look where Molly is with them
lads! They’re the field’s length behind us. How could you let ’em
do so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set a pictur’ to watch the
children as you. Run back and tell ’em to come on.”
Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so
they set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the
true Loamshire stile, and awaited the loiterers Totty observing
with complacency, “Dey naughty, naughty boys—me dood.”
The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was
fraught with great excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a
perpetual drama going on in the hedgerows, and could no more
refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple
of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he saw a yellowhammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he was peeping,
he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across
the path and was described with much fervour by the junior
Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering
along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it
managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be
got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her
ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was
told, and said “Lawks!” whenever she was expected to wonder.
Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back
and called to them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first,
shouting, “We’ve found the speckled turkey’s nest, Mother!” with
the instinctive confidence that people who bring good news are
never in fault.
“Ah,” said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this
pleasant surprise, “that’s a good lad; why, where is it?”
