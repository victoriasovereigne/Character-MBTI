and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill
disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale,
her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what should she do?
Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was
crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the
wonderful hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her,
she knew. It was dreadfully long before the General Confession
began, so that she could kneel down. Two great drops would fall
then, but no one saw them except good-natured Molly, for her
aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her. Molly, unable
to imagine any cause for tears in church except faintness, of which
she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of her pocket a
queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much labour in
pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty’s
nostrils. “It donna smell,” she whispered, thinking this was a great
advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good
without biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this
little flash of temper did what the salts could not have done—it
roused her to wipe away the traces of her tears, and try with all
her might not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in
her vain little nature: she would have borne anything rather than
be laughed at, or pointed at with any other feeling than
admiration; she would have pressed her own nails into her tender
flesh rather than people should know a secret she did not want
them to know.
What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings,
while Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn “Absolution” in her
deaf ears, and through all the tones of petition that followed!
Anger lay very close to disappointment, and soon won the victory
