“Oh no, no danger,” he said as indifferently as he could. “I don’t
know that I am more liable to irresolution than other people; only
there are little incidents now and then that set one speculating on
what might happen in the future.”
Was there a motive at work under this strange reluctance of
Arthur’s which had a sort of backstairs influence, not admitted to

as the business of the State: a great deal of hard work is done by
agents who are not acknowledged. In a piece of machinery, too, I

The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwine’s mind as he
