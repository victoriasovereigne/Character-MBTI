I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an
instant longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin
Poyser and his family. And there was another pair of dark eyes
that found it impossible not to wander thither, and rest on that
round pink-and-white figure. But Hetty was at that moment quite

had not looked. So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at
the cushioned pew in the chancel—there was no one but old Mr.
Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief,
