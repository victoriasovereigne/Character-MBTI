There are various orders of beauty, causing men to make fools
of themselves in various styles, from the desperate to the sheepish;
but there is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the
heads not only of men, but of all intelligent mammals, even of
women. It is a beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy
ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies

intended to be the severest of mentors, continually gazed at
Hetty’s charms by the sly, fascinated in spite of herself; and after

neckerchief, tucked into her low plum-coloured stuff bodice, or
how the linen butter-making apron, with its bib, seemed a thing to
be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it fell in such charming
lines, or how her brown stockings and thick-soled buckled shoes
