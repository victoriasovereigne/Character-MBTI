“Perhaps Craig, the gardener, comes to take care of you?”
A deep blush overspread Hetty’s face and neck. “I’m sure he
doesn’t; I’m sure he never did; I wouldn’t let him; I don’t like him,”
she said hastily, and the tears of vexation had come so fast that
before she had done speaking a bright drop rolled down her hot
cheek. Then she felt ashamed to death that she was crying, and for
one long instant her happiness was all gone. But in the next she
felt an arm steal round her, and a gentle voice said, “Why, Hetty,
what makes you cry? I didn’t mean to vex you. I wouldn’t vex you
for the world, you little blossom. Come, don’t cry; look at me, else I
shall think you won’t forgive me.”
Arthur had laid his hand on the soft arm that was nearest to
him, and was stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing
entreaty. Hetty lifted her long dewy lashes, and met the eyes that
were bent towards her with a sweet, timid, beseeching look. What
a space of time those three moments were while their eyes met
and his arms touched her! Love is such a simple thing when we
have only one-and-twenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen
trembles under our glance, as if she were a bud first opening her
heart with wondering rapture to the morning. Such young
unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches
that touch softly and are at rest; they mingle as easily as two
brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and
ripple with ever-interlacing curves in the leafiest hiding-places.
While Arthur gazed into Hetty’s dark beseeching eyes, it made no
difference to him what sort of English she spoke; and even if hoops
and powder had been in fashion, he would very likely not have
been sensible just then that Hetty wanted those signs of high
breeding.
