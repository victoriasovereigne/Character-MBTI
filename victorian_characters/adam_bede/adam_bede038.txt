Poyser, who was remarkable for the facility with which she could
relapse from her official objurgatory to one of fondness or of
friendly converse. “Never mind! Mother’s done her ironing now.
She’s going to put the ironing things away.”
“Munny, I tould ’ike to do into de barn to Tommy, to see de
whittawd.”
“No, no, no; Totty ’ud get her feet wet,” said Mrs. Poyser,
carrying away her iron. “Run into the dairy and see cousin Hetty
make the butter.”
“I tould ’ike a bit o’ pum-take,” rejoined Totty, who seemed to
be provided with several relays of requests; at the same time,
taking the opportunity of her momentary leisure to put her fingers
into a bowl of starch, and drag it down so as to empty the contents
with tolerable completeness on to the ironing sheet.
“Did ever anybody see the like?” screamed Mrs. Poyser,
running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue
stream. “The child’s allays i’ mischief if your back’s turned a
minute. What shall I do to you, you naughty, naughty gell?”
Totty, however, had descended from her chair with great
swiftness, and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort
of waddling run, and an amount of fat on the nape of her neck
which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling
pig.
The starch having been wiped up by Molly’s help, and the
ironing apparatus put by, Mrs. Poyser took up her knitting which
always lay ready at hand, and was the work she liked best, because
she could carry it on automatically as she walked to and fro. But
now she came and sat down opposite Dinah, whom she looked at
in a meditative way, as she knitted her grey worsted stocking.
