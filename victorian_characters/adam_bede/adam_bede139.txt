like Hetty. An’ I’m none for having her so over pretty. Though for
the matter o’ that, there’s people wi’ light hair an’ blue eyes as
pretty as them wi’ black. If Dinah had got a bit o’ colour in her
cheeks, an’ didn’t stick that Methodist cap on her head, enough to
frighten the cows, folks ’ud think her as pretty as Hetty.”
“Nay, nay,” said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous
emphasis, “thee dostna know the pints of a woman. The men ’ud
niver run after Dinah as they would after Hetty.”
“What care I what the men ’ud run after? It’s well seen what
choice the most of ’em know how to make, by the poor draggletails o’ wives you see, like bits o’ gauze ribbin, good for nothing
when the colour’s gone.”
“Well, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a
choice when I married thee,” said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled
little conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; “and thee
wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year ago.”
“I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good
missis of a house. There’s Chowne’s wife ugly enough to turn the
milk an’ save the rennet, but she’ll niver save nothing any other
way. But as for Dinah, poor child, she’s niver likely to be buxom as
long as she’ll make her dinner o’ cake and water, for the sake o’
giving to them as want. She provoked me past bearing sometimes;
and, as I told her, she went clean again’ the Scriptur’, for that says,
‘Love your neighbour as yourself’; ‘but,’ I said, ‘if you loved your
neighbour no better nor you do yourself, Dinah, it’s little enough
you’d do for him. You’d be thinking he might do well enough on a
half-empty stomach.’ Eh, I wonder where she is this blessed
Sunday! Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as she’d set her
heart on going to all of a sudden.”
