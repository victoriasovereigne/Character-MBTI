pocket with the five sixpences in it, and Totty showed her teeth
and wrinkled her nose in great glee; but, divining that there was
nothing more to be got by staying, she jumped off the shelf and
ran away to jingle her pocket in the hearing of Nancy, while her
mother called after her, “Oh for shame, you naughty gell! Not to
thank the captain for what he’s given you I’m sure, sir, it’s very
kind of you; but she’s spoiled shameful; her father won’t have her
said nay in anything, and there’s no managing her. It’s being the
youngest, and th’ only gell.”
“Oh, she’s a funny little fatty; I wouldn’t have her different. But
I must be going now, for I suppose the rector is waiting for me.”
With a “good-bye,” a bright glance, and a bow to Hetty, Arthur
left the dairy. But he was mistaken in imagining himself waited
for. The rector had been so much interested in his conversation
with Dinah that he would not have chosen to close it earlier; and
you shall hear now what they had been saying to each other.
