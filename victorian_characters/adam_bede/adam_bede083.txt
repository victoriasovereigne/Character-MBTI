gentleman like Mr. Arthur, and her very vanity made her more coy
of speech.
“Do you come every week to see Mrs. Pomfret?”
“Yes, sir, every Thursday, only when she’s got to go out with
Miss Donnithorne.”
“And she’s teaching you something, is she?”
“Yes, sir, the lace-mending as she learnt abroad, and the
stocking-mending—it looks just like the stocking, you can’t tell it’s
been mended; and she teaches me cutting-out too.”
“What! are you going to be a lady’s maid?”
“I should like to be one very much indeed.” Hetty spoke more
audibly now, but still rather tremulously; she thought, perhaps she
seemed as stupid to Captain Donnithorne as Luke Britton did to
her.
“I suppose Mrs. Pomfret always expects you at this time?”
“She expects me at four o’clock. I’m rather late to-day, because
my aunt couldn’t spare me; but the regular time is four, because
that gives us time before Miss Donnithorne’s bell rings.”
“Ah, then, I must not keep you now, else I should like to show
you the Hermitage. Did you ever see it?”
“No, sir.”
“This is the walk where we turn up to it. But we must not go
now. I’ll show it you some other time, if you’d like to see it.”
“Yes, please, sir.”
“Do you always come back this way in the evening, or are you
afraid to come so lonely a road?”
“Oh no, sir, it’s never late; I always set out by eight o’clock, and
it’s so light now in the evening. My aunt would be angry with me if
I didn’t get home before nine.”
