about things as other people did. She was a mystery to Hetty, but
Hetty knew she was always kind. She couldn’t imagine Dinah’s
face turning away from her in dark reproof or scorn, Dinah’s voice
willingly speaking ill of her, or rejoicing in her misery as a
punishment. Dinah did not seem to belong to that world of Hetty’s,
whose glance she dreaded like scorching fire. But even to her
Hetty shrank from beseeching and confession. She could not
prevail on herself to say, “I will go to Dinah”: she only thought of
that as a possible alternative, if she had not courage for death.
The good landlady was amazed when she saw Hetty come
downstairs soon after herself, neatly dressed, and looking
resolutely self-possessed. Hetty told her she was quite well this
morning. She had only been very tired and overcome with her
journey, for she had come a long way to ask about her brother,
who had run away, and they thought he was gone for a soldier,
and Captain Donnithorne might know, for he had been very kind
to her brother once. It was a lame story, and the landlady looked
doubtfully at Hetty as she told it; but there was a resolute air of
self-reliance about her this morning, so different from the helpless
prostration of yesterday, that the landlady hardly knew how to
make a remark that might seem like prying into other people’s
affairs. She only invited her to sit down to breakfast with them,
and in the course of it Hetty brought out her ear-rings and locket,
and asked the landlord if he could help her to get money for them.
Her journey, she said, had cost her much more than she expected,
and now she had no money to get back to her friends, which she
wanted to do at once.
It was not the first time the landlady had seen the ornaments,
for she had examined the contents of Hetty’s pocket yesterday,
