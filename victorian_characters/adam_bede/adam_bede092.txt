irritated, mortified. He no sooner fixed his mind on the probable
consequences of giving way to the emotions which had stolen over
him to-day—of continuing to notice Hetty, of allowing himself any
opportunity for such slight caresses as he had been betrayed into
already—than he refused to believe such a future possible for
himself. To flirt with Hetty was a very different affair from flirting
with a pretty girl of his own station: that was understood to be an
amusement on both sides, or, if it became serious, there was no
obstacle to marriage. But this little thing would be spoken ill of
directly, if she happened to be seen walking with him; and then
those excellent people, the Poysers, to whom a good name was as
precious as if they had the best blood in the land in their veins—he
should hate himself if he made a scandal of that sort, on the estate
that was to be his own some day, and among tenants by whom he
liked, above all, to be respected. He could no more believe that he
should so fall in his own esteem than that he should break both his
legs and go on crutches all the rest of his life. He couldn’t imagine
himself in that position; it was too odious, too unlike him.
And even if no one knew anything about it, they might get too
fond of each other, and then there could be nothing but the misery
of parting, after all. No gentleman, out of a ballad, could marry a
farmer’s niece. There must be an end to the whole thing at once. It
was too foolish.
And yet he had been so determined this morning, before he
went to Gawaine’s; and while he was there something had taken
hold of him and made him gallop back. It seemed he couldn’t quite
depend on his own resolution, as he had thought he could; he
almost wished his arm would get painful again, and then he should
think of nothing but the comfort it would be to get rid of the pain.
