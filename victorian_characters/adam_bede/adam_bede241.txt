part with any of our guests till eleven. Mrs. Irwine and I, who are
elderly people, think of sitting out the dance till then.”
“Oh, Your Honour, it’s all right and proper for gentlefolks to
stay up by candlelight—they’ve got no cheese on their minds.
We’re late enough as it is, an’ there’s no lettin’ the cows know as
they mustn’t want to be milked so early to-morrow mornin’. So, if
you’ll please t’ excuse us, we’ll take our leave.”
“Eh!” she said to her husband, as they set off in the cart, “I’d
sooner ha’ brewin’ day and washin’ day together than one o’ these
pleasurin’ days. There’s no work so tirin’ as danglin’ about an’
starin’ an’ not rightly knowin’ what you’re goin’ to do next; and
keepin’ your face i’ smilin’ order like a grocer o’ market-day for
fear people shouldna think you civil enough. An’ you’ve nothing to
show for ’t when it’s done, if it isn’t a yallow face wi’ eatin’ things
as disagree.”
“Nay, nay,” said Mr. Poyser, who was in his merriest mood, and
felt that he had had a great day, “a bit o’ pleasuring’s good for thee
sometimes. An’ thee danc’st as well as any of ’em, for I’ll back thee
against all the wives i’ the parish for a light foot an’ ankle. An’ it
was a great honour for the young squire to ask thee first—I reckon
it was because I sat at th’ head o’ the table an’ made the speech.
An’ Hetty too—she never had such a partner before—a fine young
gentleman in reg’mentals. It’ll serve you to talk on, Hetty, when
you’re an old woman—how you danced wi’ th’ young squire the
day he come o’ age.”
