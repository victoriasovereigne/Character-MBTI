going to Dinah—if nobody besides Dinah would ever know—Hetty
could have made up her mind to go to her. The soft voice, the
pitying eyes, would have drawn her. But afterwards the other
people must know, and she could no more rush on that shame
than she could rush on death.
She must wander on and on, and wait for a lower depth of
despair to give her courage. Perhaps death would come to her, for
she was getting less and less able to bear the day’s weariness. And
yet—such is the strange action of our souls, drawing us by a
lurking desire towards the very ends we dread—Hetty, when she
set out again from Norton, asked the straightest road northwards
towards Stonyshire, and kept it all that day.
Poor wandering Hetty, with the rounded childish face and the
hard, unloving, despairing soul looking out of it—with the narrow
heart and narrow thoughts, no room in them for any sorrows but
her own, and tasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness!
My heart bleeds for her as I see her toiling along on her weary
feet, or seated in a cart, with her eyes fixed vacantly on the road
before her, never thinking or caring whither it tends, till hunger
comes and makes her desire that a village may be near.
What will be the end, the end of her objectless wandering, apart
from all love, caring for human beings only through her pride,
clinging to life only as the hunted wounded brute clings to it?
God preserve you and me from being the beginners of such
misery!
