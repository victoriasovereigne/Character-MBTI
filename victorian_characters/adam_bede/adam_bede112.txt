but dim ill-defined pictures that her narrow bit of an imagination
can make of the future; but of every picture she is the central
figure in fine clothes; Captain Donnithorne is very close to her,
putting his arm round her, perhaps kissing her, and everybody
else is admiring and envying her—especially Mary Burge, whose
new print dress looks very contemptible by the side of Hetty’s
resplendent toilette. Does any sweet or sad memory mingle with
this dream of the future—any loving thought of her second
parents—of the children she had helped to tend—of any youthful
companion, any pet animal, any relic of her own childhood even?
Not one. There are some plants that have hardly any roots: you
may tear them from their native nook of rock or wall, and just lay
them over your ornamental flower-pot, and they blossom none the

teasing you on a hot day when you want to be quiet. Marty, the
eldest, was a baby when she first came to the farm, for the
children born before him had died, and so Hetty had had them all
