wanted to get out of the way for a week or two. It seemed culpable
in Providence to allow such a combination of circumstances. To be
shut up at the Chase with a broken arm when every other fellow in
his regiment was enjoying himself at Windsor—shut up with his
grandfather, who had the same sort of affection for him as for his
parchment deeds! And to be disgusted at every turn with the

was out of the question: Arthur Donnithorne accepted his own
bond for himself with perfect confidence.
So the twelve o’clock sun saw him galloping towards Norburne;
