he dairy was certainly worth looking at: it was a scene to
sicken for with a sort of calenture in hot and dusty
streetsâ€”such coolness, such purity, such fresh fragrance
of new-pressed cheese, of firm butter, of wooden vessels
perpetually bathed in pure water; such soft colouring of red
earthenware and creamy surfaces, brown wood and polished tin,
grey limestone and rich orange-red rust on the iron weights and
hooks and hinges. But one gets only a confused notion of these
details when they surround a distractingly pretty girl of seventeen,
standing on little pattens and rounding her dimpled arm to lift a
pound of butter out of the scale.
Hetty blushed a deep rose-colour when Captain Donnithorne
entered the dairy and spoke to her; but it was not at all a
distressed blush, for it was inwreathed with smiles and dimples,
and with sparkles from under long, curled, dark eyelashes; and
while her aunt was discoursing to him about the limited amount of
milk that was to be spared for butter and cheese so long as the
calves were not all weaned, and a large quantity but inferior
quality of milk yielded by the shorthorn, which had been bought
on experiment, together with other matters which must be
interesting to a young gentleman who would one day be a
landlord, Hetty tossed and patted her pound of butter with quite a
self-possessed, coquettish air, slyly conscious that no turn of her
head was lost.
