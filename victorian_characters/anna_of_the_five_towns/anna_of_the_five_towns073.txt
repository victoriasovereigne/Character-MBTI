Anna passed rapidly out of he door, down the Quadrangle, and into
Trafalgar Road. She was the first to leave, daring not to stay in the
room a moment. She had seen him; he had not altered since Sunday;
there was no disillusion, but a deepening of the original impression.
Caught up by the soaring of his spirit, her spirit lifted, and she was
conscious of vague but intense longing skyward. She could not reason
or think in that dizzying hour, but she made resolutions which had no
verbal form, yielding eagerly to his influence and his appeal. Not
till she had reached the bottom of Duck Bank and was breasting the
first rise towards Bleakridge did her pace slacken. Then a voice
called to her from behind. She recognised it, and turned sharply
beneath the shock. Mynors raised his hat and greeted her.
