"Poor little thing!" Mrs. Sutton murmured; and Beatrice told her father
to give Agnes a shilling to buy chocolates at Stevenson's in St. Luke's
Square, that being the best shop. The shilling fell between the
footboard and the platform. A scream from Beatrice! The attendant
porter promised to rescue the shilling in due course. The engine
whistled, the silver-mounted guard asserted his authority, Mynors
leaped in, and amid laughter and tears the brief and unique joy of
Anna's life began.
