"Anna," he said in his harsh, abrupt tones, and then stopped for a
moment before continuing. His thick, short fingers held the list which
he had previously been consulting. She waited in bewilderment. "It's
your birthday, ye told me. I hadna' forgotten. Ye're of age to-day,
and there's summat for ye. Your mother had a fortune of her own, and
under your grandfeyther's will it comes to you when you're twenty-one.
I'm the trustee. Your mother had eighteen thousand pounds i'
Government stock." He laid a slight sneering emphasis on the last two
words. "That was near twenty-five year ago. I've nigh on trebled it
for ye, what wi' good investments and interest accumulating. Thou'rt
worth'--here he changed to the second personal singular, a habit with
him--'thou'rt worth this day as near fifty thousand as makes no matter,
Anna. And that's a tidy bit."
