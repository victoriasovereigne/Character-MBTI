She felt that the complaint was a just one. Even before supper, when
nothing had occurred to preoccupy her, she had spoken little. There
had seemed so much to tell--at Port Erin, and now there seemed nothing
to tell. She ventured into a flaccid, perfunctory account of
Beatrice's illness, of the fishing, of the unfinished houses which had
caught the fancy of Mr. Sutton; she said the sea had been smooth, that
they had had something to eat at Liverpool, that the train for Crewe
was very prompt; and then she could think of no more. Silence fell
again. The supper-things were cleared away and washed up. At a
quarter-past nine, Agnes, vainly begging permission to stay up in order
to see Mr. Mynors, was sent to bed, only partially comforted by a
clothes-brush, long desired, which Anna had brought for her as a
present from the Isle of Man.
