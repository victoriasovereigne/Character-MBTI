"That's always the beginner's luck," said Beatrice, pale and
dishevelled. They all relapsed into the silence of fatigue. It was
growing dusk when the train stopped at the tiny terminus. The station
was a hive of bustling activity, the arrival of this train being the
daily event at that end of the world. Mynors and the Suttons were
greeted familiarly by several sailors, and one of these, Tom Kelly, a
tall, middle-aged man, with grey beard, small grey eyes, a wrinkled
skin of red mahogany, and an enormous fist, was introduced to Anna. He
raised his cap, and shook hands. She was touched by the sad, kind look
on his face, the melancholy impress of the sea. Then they drove to
their lodging, and here again the party was welcomed as being old and
tried friends. A fire was burning in the parlour. Throwing herself
down in front of it, Mrs. Sutton breathed, "At last! Oh, for some
tea." Through the window, Anna had a glimpse of a deeply indented bay
at the foot of cliffs below them, with a bold headland to the right.
Fishing vessels with flat red sails seemed to hang undecided just
outside the bay. From cottage chimneys beneath the road blue smoke
softly ascended.
