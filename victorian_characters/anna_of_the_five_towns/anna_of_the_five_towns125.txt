"If Mr. Mynors calls while I'm out, you mun tell him to wait," Mr.
Tellwright said to Agnes, pointedly ignoring Anna's presence. Then,
having brushed his greenish hat on his sleeve he went off towards town
to buy meat and vegetables. He always did Saturday's marketing
himself. At the butcher's and in the St. Luke's covered market he was
a familiar and redoubtable figure. Among the salespeople who stood the
market was a wrinkled, hardy old potato-woman from the other side of
Moorthorne: every Saturday the miser bested her in their
higgling-match, and nearly every Saturday she scornfully threw at him
the same joke: "Get thee along to th' post-office, Master Terrick:[1]
happen they'll give thee sixpenn'orth o' stamps for fivepence
ha"penny." He seldom failed to laugh heartily at this.
