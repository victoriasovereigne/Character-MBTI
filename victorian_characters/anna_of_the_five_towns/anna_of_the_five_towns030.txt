In the dissolving views of her own past, from which the rigour and pain
seemed to have mysteriously departed, the chief figure was always her
father--that sinister and formidable individuality, whom her mind hated
but her heart disobediently loved. Ephraim Tellwright[1] was one of
the most extraordinary and most mysterious men in the Five Towns. The
outer facts of his career were known to all, for his riches made him
notorious; but of the secret and intimate man none knew anything except
Anna, and what little Anna knew had come to her by divination rather
than discernment. A native of Hanbridge, he had inherited a small
fortune from his father, who was a prominent Wesleyan Methodist. At
thirty, owing mainly to investments in property which his calling of
potter's valuer had helped him to choose with advantage, he was worth
twenty thousand pounds, and he lived in lodgings on a total expenditure
of about a hundred a year. When he was thirty-five he suddenly
married, without any perceptible public wooing, the daughter of a wood
merchant at Oldcastle, and shortly after the marriage his wife
inherited from her father a sum of eighteen thousand pounds. The pair
lived narrowly in a small house up at Pireford, between Hanbridge and
Oldcastle. They visited no one, and were never seen together except on
Sundays. She was a rosy-cheeked, very unassuming and simple woman, who
smiled easily and talked with difficulty, and for the rest lived
apparently a servile life of satisfaction and content. After five
years Anna was born, and in another five years Mrs. Tellwright died of
erysipelas. The widower engaged a housekeeper: otherwise his existence
proceeded without change. No stranger visited the house, the
housekeeper never gossiped; but tales will spread, and people fell into
the habit of regarding Tellwright's child and his housekeeper with
commiseration.
