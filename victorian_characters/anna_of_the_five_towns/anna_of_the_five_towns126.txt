These domestic upheavals followed always the same course, and Anna had
learnt to suffer the later stages of them with calmness and even with
impassivity. Henry Mynors had not called. She supposed that her
father had expected him to call for the answer which she had forgotten
to give him, and she had a hope that he would come in the afternoon:
once again she had the idea that something definite and satisfactory
might result if she could only see him--that she might, as it were,
gather inspiration from the mere sight of his face. After dinner,
while the girls were washing the dinner things in the scullery, Agnes's
quick ear caught the sound of voices in the parlour. They listened.
Mynors had come. Mr. Tellwright must have seen him from the front
window and opened the door to him before he could ring.
