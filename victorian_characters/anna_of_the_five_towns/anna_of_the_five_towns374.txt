"Mr. Mynors is coming up for supper to-night. He wants to see you;'
Anna said to her father, as calmly as she could. The miser grunted.
But at eight o'clock, the hour immutably fixed for supper, Henry had
not arrived. The meal proceeded, of course, without him. To Anna his
absence was unaccountable and disturbing, for none could be more
punctilious than he in the matter of appointments. She expected him
every moment, but he did not appear. Agnes, filled full of the great
secret confided to her, was more openly impatient than her sister.
Neither of them could talk, and a heavy silence fell upon the family
group, a silence which her father, on that particular evening of Anna's
return, resented.
