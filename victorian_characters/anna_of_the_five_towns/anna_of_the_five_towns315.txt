Mrs. Sutton's purchases of food at the three principal shops of the
village seemed startlingly profuse to Anna, but gradually she became
accustomed to the scale, and to the amazing habit of always buying the
very best of everything, from beefsteak to grapes. Anna calculated
that the housekeeping could not cost less than six pounds a week for
the five. At Manor Terrace three people existed on a pound. With her
half-sovereign Beatrice bought a belt and a pair of sand-shoes, and
some cigarettes for Henry. Mrs. Sutton bought a pipe with a nickel
cap, such as is used by sailors. When they returned to the house, Mr.
Sutton and Henry were smoking on the front. All five walked in a row
down to the harbour, the Alderman giving an arm each to Beatrice and
Anna. Near the "Falcon' the procession had to be stopped in order to
view the unfinished houses. Tom Kelly had a cabin partly excavated out
of the rock behind the little quay. Here they found him entangled amid
nets, sails, and oars. All crowded into the cabin and shook hands with
its owner, who remarked with severity on their pallid faces, and
insisted that a change of complexion must be brought about. Mynors
offered him his tobacco-pouch, but on seeing the light colour of the
tobacco he shook his head and refused it, at the same time taking from
within his jersey a lump of something that resembled leather.
