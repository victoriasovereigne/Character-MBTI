All went early to bed, for the weariness of Mr. and Mrs. Sutton seemed
to communicate itself to the three young people, who might otherwise
have gone forth into the village in search of adventures. Anna and
Beatrice shared a room. Each inspected the other's clothes, and
Beatrice made Anna try on the new serge skirt. Through the thin wall
came the sound of Mr. and Mrs. Sutton talking, a high voice, then a
bass reply, in continual alternation. Beatrice said that these two
always discussed the day's doings in such manner. In a few moments
Beatrice was snoring; she had the subdued but steady and serious snore
characteristic of some muscular men. Anna felt no inclination to
sleep. She lived again hour by hour through the day, and beneath
Beatrice's snore her ear caught the undertone of the sea.
