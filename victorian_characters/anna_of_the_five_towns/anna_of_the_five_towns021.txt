Both Mynors and Anna looked sharply round. Beatrice Sutton was coming
towards them along the terrace. Stylishly clad in a dress of pink
muslin, with harmonious hat, gloves, and sunshade, she made an
agreeable and rather effective picture, despite her plain, round face
and stoutish figure. She had the air of being a leader. Grafted on to
the original simple honesty of her eyes there was the
unconsciously-acquired arrogance of one who had always been accustomed
to deference. Socially, Beatrice had no peer among the young women who
were active in the Wesleyan Sunday-school. Beatrice had been used to
teach in the afternoon school, but she had recently advanced her
labours from the afternoon to the morning in response to a hint that if
she did so the force of her influence and example might lessen the
chronic dearth of morning teachers.
