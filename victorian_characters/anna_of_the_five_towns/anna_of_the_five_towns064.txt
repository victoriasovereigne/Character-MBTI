Anna gazed through the window. Like many women, and not a few men, in
the Five Towns, she was wholly ignorant of the staple manufacture. The
interior of a works was almost as strange to her as it would have been
to a farm-hand from Sussex. A girl came out of a door on the opposite
side of the quadrangle: the creature was clothed in clayey rags, and
carried on her right shoulder a board laden with biscuit[2] cups. She
began to mount one of the wooden stairways, and as she did so the
board, six feet in length, swayed alarmingly to and fro. Anna expected
to see it fall with a destructive crash, but the girl went up in
safety, and with a nonchalant jerk of the shoulder aimed the end of the
board through another door and vanished from sight. To Anna it was a
thrilling feat, but she noticed that a man who stood in the yard did
not even turn his head to watch it. Mr. Price recalled her to the
business of her errand.
