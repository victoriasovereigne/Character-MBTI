During the rest of the meal she said little. On some natures Miss
Dickinson's gossip had the effect of bringing them to silence. Anna
had not seen Mynors since the previous Sunday, and now she was
apparently unperceived by him. He talked gaily with Beatrice and Mrs.
Banks: that group was a centre of animation. Anna envied their ease of
manner, their smooth and sparkling flow of conversation. She had the
sensation of feeling vulgar, clumsy, tongue-tied; Mynors and Beatrice
possessed something which she would never possess. So they had been
engaged! But had they? Or was it an idle rumour, manufactured by one
who spent her life in such creations? Anna was conscious of
misgivings. She had despised Beatrice once, but now it seemed that
after all Beatrice was the natural equal of Henry Mynors. Was it more
likely that Mynors or she, Anna, should be mistaken in Beatrice? That
Beatrice had generous instincts she was sure. Anna lost confidence in
herself; she felt humbled, out-of-place, and shamed.
