The Wesleyan Bazaar, the greatest undertaking of its kind ever known in
Bursley, gradually became a cloud which filled the entire social
horizon. Mrs. Sutton, organiser of the Sunday-school stall, pressed
all her friends into the service, and a fortnight after the death of
Sarah Vodrey, Anna and even Agnes gave much of their spare time to the
work, which was carried on under pressure increasing daily as the final
moments approached. This was well for Anna, in that it diverted her
thoughts by keeping her energies fully engaged. One morning, however,
it occurred to Mrs. Sutton to reflect that Anna, at such a period of
life, should be otherwise employed. Anna had called at the Suttons' to
deliver some finished garments.
