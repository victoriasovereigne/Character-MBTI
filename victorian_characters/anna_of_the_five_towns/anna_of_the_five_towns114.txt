Men and women and boys and girls were on their way to work, with
hurried clattering steps, some munching thick pieces of bread as they
went, all self-centred, apparently morose and not quite awake. The
dust lay thick in the arid gutters, and in drifts across the pavement;
as the night-wind had blown it. Vehicular traffic had not begun, and
blinds were still drawn; and though the footpaths were busy the street
had a deserted and forlorn aspect. Anna walked hastily down the road,
avoiding the glances of such as looked at her, but peering furtively at
the faces of those who ignored her. All seemed callous--hoggishly
careless of the everlasting verities. At first it appeared strange to
her that the potent revival in the Wesleyan chapel had produced no
effect on these preoccupied people. Bursley, then, continued its dull
and even course. She wondered whether any of them guessed that she was
going to the prayer-meeting and secretly sneered at her therefore.
