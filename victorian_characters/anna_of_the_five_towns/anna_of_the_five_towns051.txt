That afternoon it was a shy and timid Anna who swung back the heavy
polished and glazed portals of the Bursley branch of the Birmingham,
Sheffield and district Bank, the opulent and spacious erection which
stands commandingly at the top of St. Luke's Square. She looked about
her, across broad counters, enormous ledgers, and rows of bent heads,
and wondered whom she should address. Then a bearded gentleman, who
was weighing gold in a balance, caught sight of her: he slid the gold
into a drawer, and whisked round the end of the counter with a celerity
which was, at any rate, not born of practice, for he, the cashier, had
not done such a thing for years.
