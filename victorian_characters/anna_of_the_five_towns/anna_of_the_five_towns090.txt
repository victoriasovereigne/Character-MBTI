On the Friday afternoon, during tea, a boy brought up a large foolscap
packet addressed to Mr. Tellwright. "From Mr. Mynors," the boy said.
Tellwright opened it leisurely after the boy had gone, and took out
some sheets covered with figures which he carefully examined. "Anna,"
he said, as she was clearing away the tea things, "I understand thou'rt
going to the Revival meeting to-night. I shall have a message as thou
mun give to Mr. Mynors."
