Shortly after half-past five the gong sounded for tea, and the ladies,
bidden by Mrs. Sutton, unanimously thronged into the hall and towards a
room at the back of the house. Beatrice came and took Anna by the arm.
As they were crossing the hall there was a ring at the door. "There's
father--and Mr. Banks, too," Beatrice exclaimed, opening to them.
Everyone in the vicinity, animated suddenly by this appearance of the
male sex, turned with welcoming smiles. "A greeting to you all," the
minister ejaculated with formal suavity as he removed his low hat. The
Alderman beamed a rather absent-minded goodwill on the entire company,
and said: "Well! I see we're just in time for tea." Then he kissed
his daughter, and she accepted from him his hat and stick. "Miss
Tellwright, pa," Beatrice said, drawing Anna forward: he shook hands
with her heartily, emerging for a moment from the benignant dream in
which he seemed usually to exist.
