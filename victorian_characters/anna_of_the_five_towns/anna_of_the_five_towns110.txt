The bedroom was over the kitchen and faced south. The moon was hidden
by clouds, but clear stretches of sky showed thick-studded clusters of
stars brightly winking. To the far right across the fields the
silhouette of Hillport Church could just be discerned on the ridge. In
front, several miles away, the blast-furnaces of Cauldon Bar Ironworks
shot up vast wreaths of yellow flame with canopies of tinted smoke.
Still more distant were a thousand other lights crowning chimney and
kiln, and nearer, on the waste lands west of Bleakridge, long fields of
burning ironstone glowed with all the strange colours of decadence.
The entire landscape was illuminated and transformed by these unique
pyrotechnics of labour atoning for its grime, and dull, weird sounds,
as of the breathings and sighings of gigantic nocturnal creatures,
filled the enchanted air. It was a romantic scene, a romantic summer
night, balmy, delicate, and wrapped in meditation. But Anna saw
nothing there save the repulsive evidences of manufacture, had never
seen anything else.
