Dismal and unkempt, the interior of the house matched the exterior.
The carpets were threadbare, the discoloured wall-papers hung loose on
the walls, the ceilings were almost black, the paint had nearly been
rubbed away from the woodwork; the exhausted furniture looked as if it
would fall to pieces in despair if compelled to face the threatened
ordeal of an auction-sale. But to Anna the rooms were surprisingly
large, and there seemed so many of them! It was as if she were
exploring an immense abode, like a castle, with odd chambers
continually showing themselves in unexpected places. The upper story
was even less inviting than the ground-floor--barer, more chill,
utterly comfortless.
