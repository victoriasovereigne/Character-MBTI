Mynors told her all he knew; how Willie had discovered his father with
his toes actually touching the floor, leaning slightly forward, quite
dead; how he had then cut the rope and fetched Mynors, who went with
him to the police-station; how they had tied up the head of the corpse,
and then waited till night to wheel the body on a hand-cart from Edward
Street to the mortuary chamber at the police-station; how the police
had telephoned to the coroner, and settled at once that the inquest
should be held on Tuesday in the court-room at the town-hall; and how
quiet, self-contained, and dignified Willie had been, surprising
everyone by this new-found manliness. It all seemed hideously real to
Anna, as Henry added detail to detail.
