Agnes stirred slightly in her sleep, and Anna, aroused, dropped the
blind, turned towards the room and began to undress, slowly, with
reflective pauses. Her melancholy became grim, sardonic; if she was
doomed to destruction, so let it be. Suddenly, half-glad, she knelt
down and prayed, prayed that pride might be cast out, burying her face
in the coverlet and caging the passionate effusion in a whisper lest
Agnes should be disturbed. Having prayed, she still knelt quiescent;
her eyes were dry and burning. The last car thundered up the road,
shaking the house, and she rose, finished undressing, blew out the
candle, and slipped into bed by Agnes's side.
