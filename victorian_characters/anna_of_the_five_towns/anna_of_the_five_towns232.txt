It was ten o'clock that night before Ephraim Tellwright returned home
from Axe. He appeared to be in a bad temper. Agnes had gone to bed.

sat at the table while he consumed it. He ate in silence, somewhat
hungrily, and she did not deem the moment propitious for telling him
about her visit to Mynors' works.
