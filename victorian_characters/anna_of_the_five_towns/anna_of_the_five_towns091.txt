When she went upstairs to dress, she saw the Suttons' landau standing
outside their house on the opposite side of the road. Mrs. Sutton came
down the front steps and got into the carriage, and was followed by a
little restless, nervous, alert man who carried in his hand a black
case of peculiar form. "The Revivalist!" Anna exclaimed, remembering
that he was to stay with the Suttons during the Revival week. Then
this was the renowned crusader, and the case held his renowned cornet!
The carriage drove off down Trafalgar Road, and Anna could see that the
little man was talking vehemently and incessantly to Mrs. Sutton, who
listened with evident interest; at the same time the man's eyes were
everywhere, absorbing all details of the street and houses with
unquenchable curiosity.
