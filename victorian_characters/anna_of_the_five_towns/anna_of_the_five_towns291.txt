They descended into the ship, and he explained all its internal
economy, with a knowledge that seemed to her encyclop√¶dic. They stayed
a long time watching the engines, so Titanic, ruthless, and deliberate;
even the smell of the oil was pleasant to Anna. When they came on deck
again the ship was at sea. For the first time Anna beheld the ocean.
A strong breeze blew from prow to stern, yet the sea was absolutely
calm, the unruffled mirror of effulgent sunlight. The steamer moved
alone on the waters, exultantly, leaving behind it an endless track of
white froth in the green, and the shadow of its smoke. The sun, the
salt breeze, the living water, the proud gaiety of the ship, produced a
feeling of intense, inexplicable joy, a profound satisfaction with the
present, and a negligence of past and future. To exist was enough,
then. As Anna and Henry leaned over the starboard quarter and watched
the torrent of foam rush madly and ceaselessly from under the
paddle-box to be swallowed up in the white wake, the spectacle of the
wild torrent almost hypnotised them, destroying thought and reason, and
all sense of their relation to other things. With difficulty Anna
raised her eyes, and perceived the dim receding line of the Lancashire
coast.
