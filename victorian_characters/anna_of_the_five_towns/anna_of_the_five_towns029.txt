It was nearly six o'clock. The sun shone, but gentlier; and the earth
lay cooling in the mild, pensive effulgence of a summer evening. Even
the onrush of the steam-car, as it swept with a gay load of passengers
to Hanbridge, seemed to be chastened; the bell of the Roman Catholic
chapel sounded like the bell of some village church heard in the
distance; the quick but sober tramp of the chapel-goers fell peacefully
on the ear. The sense of calm increased, and, steeped in this
meditative calm, Anna from the open window gazed idly down the
perspective of the road, which ended a mile away in the dim concave
forms of ovens suffused in a pale mist. A book from the Free Library
lay on her lap; she could not read it. She was conscious of nothing
save the quiet enchantment of reverie. Her mind, stimulated by the
emotions of the afternoon, broke the fetters of habitual
self-discipline, and ranged voluptuously free over the whole field of
recollection and anticipation. To remember, to hope: that was
sufficient joy.
