The next morning there was no outward sign that anything unusual had
occurred. As the clock in the kitchen struck eight Anna carried to the
back parlour a tray on which were a dish of bacon and a coffee-pot.
Breakfast was already laid for three. She threw a housekeeper's glance
over the table, and called: "Father!" Mr. Tellwright was re-setting
some encaustic tiles in the lobby. He came in, coatless, and, dropping
a trowel on the hearth, sat down at the end of the table nearest the
fireplace. Anna sat opposite to him, and poured out the coffee.
