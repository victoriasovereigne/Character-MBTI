When they reached Shawport Station a cab was waiting for Anna. Unknown
to her, Henry had ordered it by telegraph. This considerateness was of
a piece, she thought, with his masterly conduct of the entire
journey--on the steamer, at Liverpool, in the train; nothing that an
experienced traveller could devise had been lacking to her comfort.
She got into the cab alone, while Mynors, followed by a boy and his
bag, walked to his rooms in Mount Street. It had been arranged, at
Anna's wish, that he should not appear at Manor Terrace till
supper-time. Ephraim opened for her the door of her home. It seemed
to her that he was pleased.
