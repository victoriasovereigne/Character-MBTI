Anna spent the two following afternoons in visiting the houses of her
school-children. She had no talent for such work, which demands the
vocal rather than the meditative temperament, and the apparent futility
of her labours would have disgusted and disheartened her had she not
been sustained and urged forward by the still active influence of
Mynors and the teachers' meeting. There were fifteen names in her
class-book, and she went to each house, except four whose tenants were
impeccable Wesleyan families and would have considered themselves
insulted by a quasi-didactic visit from an upstart like Anna. Of the
eleven, some parents were rude to her; others begged, and she had
nothing to give; others made perfunctory promises; only two seemed to
regard her as anything but a somewhat tiresome impertinence. The fault
was doubtless her own. Nevertheless she found joy in the uncongenial
and ill-performed task--the cold, fierce joy of the nun in her penance.
When it was done she said "I have done it," as one who has sworn to do
it come what might, yet without quite expecting to succeed.
