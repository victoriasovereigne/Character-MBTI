She thanked him sincerely, but not with her lips, only with the heart.
He had revealed to her an avenue of release from a situation which had
seemed on all sides fatally closed. She sprang eagerly towards it.
She realised afresh how frightful was the dilemma from which there was
now a hope of escape, and she was grateful accordingly. Before, she
had not dared steadily to face its terrors. She wondered that even her
father's displeasure or the project of the partnership had been able to
divert her from the plight of her soul. Putting these mundane things
firmly behind her, she concentrated the activities of her brain on that
idea of Christ-like living, day by day, hour by hour, of a gradual
aspiration towards Christ and thereby an ultimate arrival at the state
of being saved. This she thought she might accomplish; this gave
opportunity of immediate effort, dispensing with the necessity of an
impossible violent spiritual metamorphosis. They did not speak again

enter the choir from the back, bade her a quiet adieu. Anna enjoyed
the service, which passed smoothly and uneventfully. At a Revival,
night is the time of ecstasy and fervour and salvation; in the
afternoon one must be content with preparatory praise and prayer.
