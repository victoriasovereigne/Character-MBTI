Anna was now in the profoundest misery. The weight of her sins, of her
ingratitude to God, lay on her like a physical and intolerable load,
and she lost all feeling of shame, as a sea-sick voyager loses shame
after an hour of nausea. She knew then that she could no longer go on
living as aforetime. She shuddered at the thought of her tremendous
responsibility to Agnes--Agnes who took her for perfection. She
recollected all her sins individually--lies, sloth, envy, vanity, even
theft in her infancy. She heaped up all the wickedness of a lifetime,
hysterically augmented it, and found a horrid pleasure in the
exaggeration. Her virtuous acts shrank into nothingness.
