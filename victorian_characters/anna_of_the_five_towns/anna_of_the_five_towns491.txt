At nine o'clock it was announced that, though raffling was forbidden,
the bazaar would be enlivened by an auction. A licensed auctioneer was
brought, and the sale commenced. The auctioneer, however, failed to
attune himself to the wild spirit of the hour, and his professional
efforts would have resulted in a fiasco had not Mynors, perceiving the
danger, leaped to the platform and masterfully assumed the hammer.
Mynors surpassed himself in the kind of wit that amuses an excited
crowd, and the auction soon monopolised the attention of the room; it
was always afterwards remembered as the crowning success of the bazaar.
The incredible man took ten pounds in twenty minutes. During this
episode Anna, who had been left alone in the stall, first noticed
Willie Price in the room. His ship sailed on the Monday, but steerage
passengers had to be aboard on Sunday, and he was saying good-bye to a
few acquaintances. He seemed quite cheerful, as he walked about with
his hands in his pockets, chatting with this one and that; it was the
false and hysterical gaiety that precedes a final separation. As soon
as he saw Anna he came towards her.
