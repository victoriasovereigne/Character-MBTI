After tea, Mynors was one of the first to leave the room, and Anna one
of the last, but he accosted her in the hall, on the way back to the
drawing-room, and asked how she was, and how Agnes was, with such
deference and sincerity of regard for herself and everything that was
hers that she could not fail to be impressed. Her sense of humiliation
and of uncertainty was effaced by a single word, a single glance.
Uplifted by a delicious reassurance, she passed into the drawing-room,
expecting him to follow: strange to say, he did not do so. Work was
resumed, but with less ardour than before. It was in fact impossible
to be strenuously diligent after one of Mrs. Sutton's teas, and in
every heart, save those which beat over the most perfect and vigorous
digestive organs, there was a feeling of repentance. The
building-society's clock on the mantel-piece intoned seven: all
expressed surprise at the lateness of the hour, and Mrs. Clayton
Vernon, pleading fatigue after her recent indisposition, quietly
departed. As soon as she was gone, Anna said to Mrs. Sutton that she
too must go.
