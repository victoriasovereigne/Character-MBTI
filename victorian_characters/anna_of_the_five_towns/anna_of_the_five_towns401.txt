It was by accident that Anna was in the town. She knew that the
inquest was to occur that morning, but had not dreamed of attending it.
When, however, she saw the stir of excitement in the market-place, and
the police guarding the entrances of the town-hall, she walked directly
across the road, past the two officers at the east door, and into the
dark main corridor of the building, which was dotted with small groups
idly conversing. She was conscious of two things: a vehement
curiosity, and the existence somewhere in the precincts of a dead body,
unsightly, monstrous, calm, silent, careless--the insensible origin of
all this simmering ferment which disgusted her even while she shared in
it. At a small door, half hidden by a curtain, she was startled to see
Mynors.
