They cruised about while Tom prepared the lines. The short waves
chopped cheerfully against the carvel sides of the yacht; the clouds
were breaking at a hundred points; the sea grew lighter in tone; gaiety
was in the air; no one could possibly be indisposed in that innocuous
weather. At length the lines were ready, but Tom said the yacht was
making at least a knot too much for serious fishing, so Henry took a
reef in the mainsail, showing Anna how to tie the short strings. The
Alderman, lying on the fore-deck, was placidly smoking. The lines were
thrown out astern, and Mrs. Sutton and Beatrice each took one. But
they had no success; young Tom said it was because the sun had appeared.
