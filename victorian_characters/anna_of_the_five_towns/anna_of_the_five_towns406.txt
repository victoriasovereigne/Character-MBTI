On the Thursday afternoon, Anna was sitting alone in the house, with
the Persian cat and a pile of stockings on her knee, darning. Agnes
had with sorrow returned to school; Ephraim was out. The bell sounded
violently, and Anna, thinking that perhaps for some reason her father
had chosen to enter by the front door, ran to open it. The visitor was
Willie Price; he wore the new black suit which had figured in the
coroner's court. She invited him to the parlour and they both sat
down, tongue-tied. Now that she had learnt from his evidence given at
the inquest that Ephraim had not been pressing for rent during her
absence in the Isle of Man, she felt less like a criminal before Willie
than she would have felt without that assurance. But at the best she
was nervous, self-conscious, and shamed. She supposed that he had
called to make some arrangement with reference to the tenure of the
works, or, more probably, to announce a bankruptcy and stoppage.
