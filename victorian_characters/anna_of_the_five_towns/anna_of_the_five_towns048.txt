"A hundred and----! Well, I never!" Anna was aghast. The sum
appeared larger to her than all the thousands and tens of thousands
which she had received in the morning. She reflected that the weekly
bills of the household amounted to about a sovereign, and that the
total of this debt of Price's would therefore keep them in food for two
years. The idea of being in debt was abhorrent to her. She could not
conceive how a man who was in debt could sleep at nights. "Mr. Price
ought to be ashamed of himself," she said warmly. "I'm sure he's quite
able to pay." The image of the sleek and stout superintendent of the
Sunday-school, arrayed in his rich, almost voluptuous, broadcloth,
offended her profoundly. That he, debtor and promise-breaker, should
have the effrontery to pray for the souls of children, to chastise
their petty furtive crimes, was nearly incredible.
