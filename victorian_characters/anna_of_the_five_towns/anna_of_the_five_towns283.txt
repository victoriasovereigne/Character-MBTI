It was an incredible day, the following Saturday, a warm and benign day
of earliest autumn. The Suttons, in a hired cab, called for Anna at
half-past eight, on the way to the main line station at Shawport.
Anna's tin box was flung on to the roof of the cab amid the trunks and
portmanteaux already there.
