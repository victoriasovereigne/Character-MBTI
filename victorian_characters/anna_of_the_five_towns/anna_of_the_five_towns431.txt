"Anna, tell me all about it," Beatrice burst out when she and Anna had
fled to her bedroom. "I'm so glad. Do you love him really--truly?
He's dreadfully fond of you. He told me so this morning; we had quite
a long chat in the market. I think you're both very lucky, you know."
She kissed Anna effusively for the third time. Anna looked at her
smiling but silent.
