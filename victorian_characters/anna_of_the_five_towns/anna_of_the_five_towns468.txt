That night remains for ever fixed in Anna's memory: the grim rooms,
echoing and shadowy; the countless journeys up and down dark stairs and
passages; Willie sitting always immovable in the kitchen, idle because
there was nothing for him to do; Sarah incessantly panting on the
truckle-bed; the hired woman from up the street, buxom, kindly, useful,
but fatuous in the endless monotony of her commiserations.
