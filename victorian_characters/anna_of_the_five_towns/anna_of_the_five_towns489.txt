Mynors arrived next, with something concealed in tissue-paper. He
removed the paper, and showed, in a frame of crimson plush, a common
white plate decorated with a simple band and line, and a monogram in
the centre--"A.T." Anna blushed, recognising the plate which she had
painted that afternoon in July at Mynors' works.
