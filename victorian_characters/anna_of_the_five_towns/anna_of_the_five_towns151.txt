Anna, secretly as excited as her sister, opened the note and
read:--"Lansdowne House, Wednesday. Dear Miss Tellwright,--Mother
gives tea to the Sunday-school Sewing Meeting here _to-morrow_. Will
you give us the pleasure of your company? I do not think you have been
to any of the S.S.S. meetings yet, but we should all be glad to see you
and have your assistance. Everyone is working very hard for the Autumn
Bazaar, and mother has set her mind on the Sunday-school stall being
the best. Do come, will you? Excuse this short notice. Yours
sincerely, BEATRICE SUTTON. P.S.--We begin at 3.30."
