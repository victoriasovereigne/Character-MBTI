Her fear was that the miser had renewed his terrible insistence during
the previous fortnight. She forgot that she had disliked the dead man,
that he had always seemed to her mean, pietistic, and two-faced. She
forgot that in pressing him for rent many months overdue she and her
father had acted within their just rights--acted as Price himself would
have acted in their place. She could think only of the strain, the
agony, the despair that must have preceded the miserable tragedy. Old
Price had atoned for all in one sublime sin, the sole deed that could
lend dignity and repose to such a figure as his. Anna's feverish
imagination reconstituted the scene in the slip-house: she saw it as
something grand, accusing, and unanswerable; and she could not dismiss
a feeling of acute remorse that she should have been engaged in
pleasure at that very hour of death. Surely some instinct should have
warned her that the hare which she had helped to hunt was at its last
gasp!
