Anna returned to the kitchen. She felt no elation or ferment of any
kind; she had not begun to realise the significance of what had
occurred. Like the soldier whom a bullet has struck, she only knew
vaguely that something had occurred. She peeled the potatoes with more
than her usual thrifty care; the peel was so thin as to be almost
transparent. It seemed to her that she could not arrange or examine
her emotions until after she had met Henry Mynors again. More than
anything else she wished to see him: it was as if out of the mere sight
of him something definite might emerge, as if when her eyes had rested
on him, and not before, she might perceive some simple solution of the
problems which she had obscurely discerned ahead of her.
