Anna closed the bedroom door softly; through the open window came the
tones of Cauldon Church clock, famous for their sonority, and richness,
announcing eleven. Agnes lay asleep under the blue-and-white
counterpane, on the side of the bed next the wall, the bed-clothes
pushed down and disclosing the upper half of her night-gowned figure.
She slept in absolute repose, with flushed cheek and every muscle lax,
her hair by some chance drawn in a perfect straight line diagonally
across the pillow. Anna glanced at her sister, the image of physical
innocence and childish security, and then, depositing the candle, went
to the window and looked out.
