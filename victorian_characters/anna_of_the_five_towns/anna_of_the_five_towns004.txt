Anna Tellwright stood motionless for a second in the shadow of the
doorway. She was tall, but not unusually so, and sturdily built up.
Her figure, though the bust was a little flat, had the lenient curves
of absolute maturity. Anna had been a woman since seventeen, and she
was now on the eve of her twenty-first birthday. She wore a plain,
home-made light frock checked with brown and edged with brown velvet,
thin cotton gloves of cream colour, and a broad straw hat like her
sister's. Her grave face, owing to the prominence of the cheekbones
and the width of the jaw, had a slight angularity; the lips were thin,
the brown eyes rather large, the eyebrows level, the nose fine and
delicate; the ears could scarcely be seen for the dark brown hair which
was brushed diagonally across the temples, leaving of the forehead only
a pale triangle. It seemed a face for the cloister, austere in
contour, fervent in expression, the severity of it mollified by that
resigned and spiritual melancholy peculiar to women who through the
error of destiny have been born into a wrong environment.
