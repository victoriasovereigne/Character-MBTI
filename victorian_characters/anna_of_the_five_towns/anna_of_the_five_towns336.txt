On the second Monday an incident occurred. In the afternoon Mr. Sutton
had asked Beatrice to go with him to Port St. Mary, and she had refused
on the plea that the light was of a suitable grey for painting. Mr.
Sutton had slipped off alone, unseen by Anna and Henry, who had meant
to accompany him in place of Beatrice. Before tea, while Anna,
Beatrice and Henry were awaiting the meal in the parlour, Mynors
referred to the matter.
