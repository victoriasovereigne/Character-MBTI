The simple and profound grief, and the restrained bitterness against
all the world, which were expressed in these words--the sole epitaph of
Titus Price--nearly made Anna cry. She would have cried, if the cat
had not opportunely jumped on her knee again; she controlled herself by
dint of stroking it. She sympathised with him more intensely in that
first moment of his loneliness than she had ever sympathised with
anyone, even Agnes. She wished passionately to shield, shelter, and
comfort him, to do something, however small, to diminish his sorrow and
humiliation; and this despite his size, his ungainliness, his coarse
features, his rough voice, his lack of all the conventional
refinements. A single look from his guileless and timid eyes atoned
for every shortcoming. Yet she could scarcely open her mouth. She
knew not what to say. She had no phrases to soften the frightful blow
which Providence had dealt him.
