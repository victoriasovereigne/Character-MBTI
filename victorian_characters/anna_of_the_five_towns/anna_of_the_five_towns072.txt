Mynors' prayer was a cogent appeal for the success of the Revival. He
knew what he wanted, and confidently asked for it, approaching God with
humility but with self-respect. The prayer was punctuated by Amens
from various parts of the room. The atmosphere became suddenly
fervent, emotional and devout. Here was lofty endeavour, idealism, a
burning spirituality; and not all the pettinesses unavoidable in such
an organisation as a Sunday-school could hide the difference between
this impassioned altruism and the ignoble selfishness of the worldly.
Anna felt, as she had often felt before, but more acutely now, that she
existed only on the fringe of the Methodist society. She had not been
converted; technically she was a lost creature: the converted knew it,
and in some subtle way their bearing towards her, and others in her
case, always showed that they knew it. Why did she teach? Not from
the impulse of religious zeal. Why was she allowed to have charge of a
class of immortal souls? The blind could not lead the blind, nor the
lost save the lost. These considerations troubled her. Conscience
pricked, accusing her of a continual pretence. The _r√¥le_ of
professing Christian, through false shame, had seemed distasteful to
her: she had said that she could never stand up and say, "I am for
Christ," without being uncomfortable. But now she was ashamed of her
inability to profess Christ. She could conceive herself proud and
happy in the very part which formerly she had despised. It was these
believers, workers, exhorters, wrestlers with Satan, who had the right
to disdain; not she. At that moment, as if divining her thoughts,
Mynors prayed for those among them who were not converted. She
blushed, and when the prayer was finished she feared lest every eye
might seek hers in inquiry; but no one seemed to notice her.
