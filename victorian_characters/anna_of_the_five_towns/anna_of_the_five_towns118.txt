She walked out into the street. It was twenty minutes to eight by the
town-hall clock. The last workmen's car of the morning was just
leaving Bursley: it was packed inside and outside, and the conductor
hung insecurely on the step. At the gates of the manufactory opposite
the chapel, a man in a white smock stood placidly smoking a pipe. A
prayer-meeting was a little thing, a trifle in the immense and regular
activity of the town: this thought necessarily occurred to Anna. She
hurried homewards, wondering what her father would say about that
morning's unusual excursion. A couple of hundred yards distant from
home she saw, to her astonishment, Agnes emerging from the front-door
of the house. The child ran rapidly down the street, not observing
Anna till they were close upon each other.
