The next morning there came to Anna a letter from the secretary of a
limited company enclosing a post-office order for ten pounds. Some
weeks previously her father had discovered an error of that amount in
the deduction of income-tax from the dividend paid by this company, and
had instructed Anna to demand the sum. She had obeyed, and then
forgotten the affair. Here was the answer. Desperate at the thought
of missing the holiday, she cashed the order, bought and made her
clothes in secret, and then, two days before the arranged date of
departure told her father what she had done. He was enraged; but since
his anger was too illogical to be rendered effectively coherent in
words, he had the wit to keep silence. With bitterness Anna reflected
that she owed her holiday to the merest accident--for if the remittance
had arrived a little earlier or a little later, or in the form of a
cheque, she could not have utilised it.
