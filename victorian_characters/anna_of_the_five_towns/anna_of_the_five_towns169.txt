Less intimidated by all this unexampled luxury than she was reassured
by the atmosphere of combined and homely effort, the lowliness of
several of her companions, and the kind, simple face of Mrs. Sutton,
Anna quickly began to feel at ease. She paused in her work, and,
glancing around her, happened to catch the eye of Miss Dickinson, who
offered a remark about the weather. Miss Dickinson was head-assistant
at a draper's in St. Luke's Square, and a pillar of the Sunday-school,
which Sunday by Sunday and year by year had watched her develop from a
rosy-cheeked girl into a confirmed spinster with sallow and warted
face. Miss Dickinson supported her mother, and was a pattern to her
sex. She was lovable, but had never been loved. She would have made
an admirable wife and mother, but fate had decided that this material
was to be wasted. Miss Dickinson found compensation for the rigour of
destiny in gossip, as innocent as indiscreet. It was said that she had
a tongue.
