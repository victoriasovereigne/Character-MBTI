Mynors smiled indulgently. They descended again to the ground floor,
and following the course of manufacture came to the 'hardening-on'
kiln, a minor oven where for twelve hours the oil is burnt out of the
colour in decorated ware. A huge, jolly man in shirt and trousers,
with an enormous apron, was in the act of drawing the kiln, assisted by
two thin boys. He nodded a greeting to Mynors and exclaimed, "Warm!"
The kiln was nearly emptied. As Anna stopped at the door, the man
addressed her.
