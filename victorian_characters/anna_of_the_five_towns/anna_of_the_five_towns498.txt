Some may argue that Anna, knowing she loved another man, ought not to
have married Mynors. But she did not reason thus; such a notion never
even occurred to her. She had promised to marry Mynors, and she
married him. Nothing else was possible. She who had never failed in
duty did not fail then. She who had always submitted and bowed the
head, submitted and bowed the head then. She had sucked in with her
mother's milk the profound truth that a woman's life is always a
renunciation, greater or less. Hers by chance was greater. Facing the
future calmly and genially, she took oath with herself to be a good
wife to the man whom, with all his excellences, she had never loved.
Her thoughts often dwelt lovingly on Willie Price, whom she deemed to
be pursuing in Australia an honourable and successful career, quickened
at the outset by her hundred pounds. This vision of him was her stay.
But neither she nor anyone in the Five Towns or elsewhere ever heard of
Willie Price again. And well might none hear! The abandoned pitshaft
does not deliver up its secret. And so--the Bank of England is the
richer by a hundred pounds unclaimed, and the world the poorer by a
simple and meek soul stung to revolt only in its last hour.
