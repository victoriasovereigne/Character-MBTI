The first Sunday was a tiresome ordeal for Anna, both at school and at
chapel. "Well, I never!" seemed to be written like a note of
exclamation on every brow; the monotony of the congratulations fatigued
her as much as her involuntary efforts to grasp what each speaker had
left unsaid of innuendo, malice, envy or sycophancy. Even the people
in the shops, during the next few days, could not serve her without
direct and curious reference to her private affairs. The general
opinion that she was a cold and bloodless creature was strengthened by
her attitude at this period. But the apathy which she displayed was
neither affected nor due to an excessive diffidence. As she seemed, so
she felt. She often wondered what would have happened to her if that
vague 'something' between Henry and Beatrice, to which Beatrice had
confessed, had ever taken definite shape.
