It was a thunderbolt to Anna, this seemingly petty misadventure. As
she entered the house she felt a tear on her cheek. She was ashamed to
weep, but she wept. This, after the fiasco of the prayer-meeting, was
a climax of woe; it overtopped and extinguished all the rest; her soul
was nothing to her now. She quickly took off her hat and ran to the
kitchen. Agnes had put the breakfast-things on the tray ready for
setting; the bread was cut, the coffee portioned into the jug; the fire
burned bright, and the kettle sang. Anna took the cloth from the
drawer in the oak dresser, and went to the parlour to lay the table.
Mr. Tellwright was at the end of the garden, pointing the wall, his
back to the house. The table set, Anna observed that the room was only
partly dusted: there was a duster on the mantelpiece; she seized it to
finish, and at that moment the kitchen clock struck eight.
Simultaneously Mr. Tellwright dropped his trowel, and came towards the
house. She doggedly dusted one chair, and then, turning coward, flew
away upstairs; the kitchen was barred to her since her father would
enter by the kitchen door.
