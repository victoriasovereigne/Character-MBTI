"Some days--yes," said Agnes, after thinking a moment. "We have had
some new cups and saucers up from Mr. Mynors works. And father has
swept the kitchen chimney. And, oh Anna! I asked him to-day if I'd
kept house well, and he said "Pretty well," and he gave me a penny.
Look! It's the first money I've ever had, you know. I wanted you at
nights, Anna--and all the time, too. I've been frightfully busy. I
cleaned silvers all afternoon. Anna, I _have_ tried---- And I've got
some tea for you. I'll go down and make it. Now you mustn't come into
the kitchen. I'll bring it to you in the parlour."
