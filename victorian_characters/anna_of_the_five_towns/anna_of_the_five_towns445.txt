The engagement, which had hitherto been kept private, became the theme
of universal gossip immediately upon the return of the Suttons from the
Isle of Man. Two words let fall by Beatrice in the St. Luke's covered
market on Saturday morning had increased and multiplied till the whole
town echoed with the news. Anna's private fortune rose as high as a
quarter of a million. As for Henry Mynors, it was said that Henry
Mynors knew what he was about. After all, he was like the rest.
Money, money! Of course it was inconceivable that a fine, prosperous
figure of a man, such as Mynors, would have made up to _her_, if she
had not been simply rolling in money. Well, there was one thing to be
said for young Mynors, he would put money to good use; you might rely
he would not hoard it up same as it had been hoarded up. However, the
more saved, the more for young Mynors, so he needn't grumble. It was
to be hoped he would make her dress herself a bit better--though indeed
it hadn't been her fault she went about so shabby; the old skinflint
would never allow her a penny of her own. So tongues wagged.
