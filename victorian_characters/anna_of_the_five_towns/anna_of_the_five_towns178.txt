During the song, Mrs. Sutton beckoned with her finger to Anna to come
and occupy the stool vacated by Beatrice. Glad to leave the vicinity
of Miss Dickinson, Anna obeyed, creeping on tiptoe across the
intervening space. "I thought I would like to have you near me, my
dear," she whispered maternally. When Beatrice had sung the song and
somehow executed that accompaniment which has terrorised whole
multitudes of drawing-room pianists, there was a great deal of applause
from both rooms. Mrs. Sutton bent down and whispered in Anna's ear:
"Her voice has been very well trained, has it not?" "Yes, very," Anna
replied. But, though "Nazareth' had seemed to her wonderful, she had
neither understood it nor enjoyed it. She tried to like it, but the
effect of it on her was bizarre rather than pleasing.
