"I had a talk with your father at the creditors' meeting yesterday,"
said the Alderman. "You won't lose much. Of course you've got a
preferential claim for six months' rent." He said this reassuringly,
as though it would give satisfaction. Anna did not know what a
preferential claim might be, nor was she aware of any creditors'
meeting. She wished ardently that she might lose as much as
possible--hundreds of pounds. She was relieved when Beatrice swept in,
her mother following.
