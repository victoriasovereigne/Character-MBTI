A man, and then another, emerged from the vestry door with beaming,
happy face. These were saved; they had yielded to Christ's persuasive
invitation. Anna tried to imagine herself converted, or in the process
of being converted. She could not. She could only sit moveless, dull,
and abject. She did not stir, even when the congregation rose for
another hymn. In what did conversion consist? Was it to say the
words, "I believe'? She repeated to herself softly, "I believe; I
believe." But nothing happened. Of course she believed. She had
never doubted, or dreamed of doubting, that Jesus died on the Cross to
save her soul--_her_ soul--from eternal damnation. She was probably
unaware that any person in Christendom had doubted that fact so
fundamental to her. What, then, was lacking? What was belief? What
was faith?
