"Hum!" the old man growled, but he was obviously content. "I gave Anna
a message for ye yesterday, Mr. Mynors, but her forgot to deliver it,
wench-like. Ye might ha' been saved th' trouble o' calling. Now as
ye're here, I've summat for tell ye. It 'll be Anna's money as 'll go
into that concern o' yours. I've none by me; in fact, I'm a'most fast
for brass, but her 'll have as near two thousand as makes no matter in
a month's time, and her says her 'll go in wi' you on th' strength o'
my recommendation."
