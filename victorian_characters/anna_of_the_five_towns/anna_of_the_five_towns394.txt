Mr. Sargent, the newly-appointed second minister, was in the pulpit--a
little, earnest bachelor, who emphasised every sentence with a
continual tremor of the voice. "Brethren," he said, after the second
hymn--and his tones vibrated with a singular effect through the
half-empty building: "Before I proceed to my sermon I have one word to
say in reference to the awful event which is doubtless uppermost in the
minds of all of you. It is not for us to judge the man who is now gone
from us, ushered into the dread presence of his Maker with the crime of
self-murder upon his soul. I say it is not for us to judge him. The
ways of the Almighty are past finding out. Therefore at such a moment
we may fitly humble ourselves before the Throne, and while prostrate
there let us intercede for the poor young man who is left behind,
bereft, and full of grief and shame. We will engage in silent prayer."
He lifted his hand, and closed his eyes, and the congregation leaned
forward against the fronts of the pews. The appealing face of Willie
presented itself vividly to Anna.
