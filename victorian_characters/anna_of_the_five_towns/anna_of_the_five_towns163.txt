Anna was unable to perceive that the picture bore any resemblance to
Alderman Sutton, except in the matter of the aldermanic robe, which she
could now trace beneath the portrait's neck. The studies on the walls
pleased her much better. Their realism amazed her. One could make out
not only that here for instance, was a fish--there was no doubt that it
was a hallibut; the solid roundness of the oranges and the glitter on
the tea-trays seemed miraculously achieved. "Have you actually done
all these?" she asked, in genuine admiration. "I think they're
splendid."
