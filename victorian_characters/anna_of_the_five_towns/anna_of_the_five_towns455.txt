It was on the very night after this eager announcement that the
approaching tragedy came one step nearer. Beatrice, in a modest
evening-dress, with a white cloak--excited, hurried, and important--ran
in to speak to Anna. The carriage was waiting outside. She and her
father and mother had to attend a very important dinner at the mayor's
house at Hillport, in connection with Mr. Sutton's impending mayoralty.
Old Sarah Vodrey had just sent down a girl to say that she was unwell,
and would be grateful if Mrs. Sutton or Beatrice would visit her. It
was a most unreasonable time for such a summons, but Sarah was a
fidgety old crotchet, and knew how frightfully good-natured Mrs. Sutton
was. Would Anna mind going up to Toft End? And would Anna come out to
the carriage and personally assure Mrs. Sutton that old Sarah should be
attended to? If not, Beatrice was afraid her mother would take it into
her head to do something stupid.
