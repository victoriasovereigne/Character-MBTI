Beatrice pouted. She was evidently annoyed with both of them. She
looked from one to the other, jealous of their mutual understanding and
agreement. Mr. and Mrs. Sutton issued from the house, and the five
stood chatting till tea was ready; but the shadow remained on
Beatrice's face. Mynors made several attempts to laugh it away, and at
dusk these two went for a stroll to Port St. Mary. They returned in a
state of deep intimacy. During supper Beatrice was consciously and
elaborately angelic, and there was that in her voice and eyes, when
sometimes she addressed Mynors, which almost persuaded Anna that he
might once have loved his cousin. At night, in the bedroom, Anna
imagined that she could detect in Beatrice's attitude the least shade
of condescension. She felt hurt, and despised herself for feeling hurt.
