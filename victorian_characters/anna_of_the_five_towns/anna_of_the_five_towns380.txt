His tone was, at the best, brusque; but she breathed more easily,
divining instantly from his manner that he meant to offer no violent
objection to the engagement. She knew that only tact was needed now.
The miser had, indeed, foreseen the possibility of this marriage for
months past, and had long since decided in his own mind that Henry
would make a satisfactory son-in-law. Ephraim had no social
ambitions--with all his meanness, he was above them; he had nothing but
contempt for rank, style, luxury, and 'the theory of what it is to be a
lady and a gentleman." Yet, by a curious contradiction, Henry's
smartness of appearance--the smartness of an unrivalled commercial
traveller--pleased him. He saw in Henry a young and sedate man of
remarkable shrewdness, a man who had saved money, had made money for
others, and was now making it for himself; a man who could be trusted
absolutely to perform that feat of 'getting on'; a 'safe' and
profoundly respectable man, at the same time audacious and
imperturbable. He was well aware that Henry had really fallen in love
with Anna, but nothing would have convinced him that Anna's money was
not the primal cause of Henry's genuine passion for Anna's self.
