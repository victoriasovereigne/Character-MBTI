The warehouse was the largest place on the works, a room sixty-feet
long and twenty broad, low, whitewashed, bare and clean. Piles of ware
occupied the whole of the walls and of the immense floorspace, but
there was no trace here of the soilure and untidiness incident to
manufacture; all processes were at an end, clay had vanished into
crock: and the calmness and the whiteness atoned for the disorder,
noise and squalor which had preceded. Here was a sample of the total
and final achievement towards which the thousands of small, disjointed
efforts that Anna had witnessed, were directed. And it seemed a
miraculous, almost impossible, result; so definite, precise and regular
after a series of acts apparently variable, inexact and casual; so
inhuman after all that intensely inhuman labour; so vast in comparison
with the minuteness of the separate endeavours. As Anna looked, for
instance, at a pile of tea-sets, she found it difficult even to
conceive that, a fortnight or so before, they had been nothing but
lumps of dirty clay. No stage of the manufacture was incredible by
itself, but the result was incredible. It was the result that appealed
to the imagination, authenticating the adage that fools and children
should never see anything till it is done.
