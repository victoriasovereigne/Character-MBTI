His voice was rich and full, but at the same time sharp and decisive.
The burning eyes were shut tight, and Anna, who had a profile view of
his face, saw that every muscle of it was drawn tense. The man
possessed an extraordinary histrionic gift, and he used it with
imagination. He had two audiences, God and the congregation. God was
not more distant from him than the congregation, or less real to him,
or less a heart to be influenced. Declamatory and full of effects
carefully calculated--a work of art, in fact--his appeal showed no
error of discretion in its approach to the Eternal. There was no
minimising of committed sin, nor yet an insincere and grovelling
self-accusation. A tyrant could not have taken offence at its tone,
which seemed to pacify God while rendering the human audience still
more contrite. The conclusion of the catalogue of wickedness and swift
confident turn to Christ's Cross was marvellously impressive. The
congregation burst out into sighs, groans, blessings, and Amens; and
the pillars of distant rural conventicles who had travelled from the
confines of the circuit to its centre in order to partake of this
spiritual excitation began to feel that they would not be disappointed.
