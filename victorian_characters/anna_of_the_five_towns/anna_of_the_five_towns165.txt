As Anna, in the wake of Beatrice, entered the drawing-room, a dozen or
more women glanced at her with keen curiosity, and the even flow of
conversation ceased for a moment, to be immediately resumed. In the
centre of the room, with her back to the fire-place, Mrs. Sutton was
seated at a square table, cutting out. Although the afternoon was warm
she had a white woollen wrap over her shoulders; for the rest she was
attired in plain black silk, with a large stuff apron containing a
pocket for scissors and chalk. She jumped up with the activity of
which Beatrice had inherited a part, and greeted Anna, kissing her
heartily.
