Anna was struck by the placidity with which they covered their
apprehension. Towards noon, Beatrice, who said that she felt better,
insisted on rising. A fire was lighted at once in the parlour, and she
sat in front of it till tea-time, when she was obliged to go to bed
again. On the Wednesday morning, after a night which had been almost
sleepless for both girls, her temperature stood at 103Â°, and Henry
fetched the doctor, who pronounced it a case of influenza, severe,
demanding very careful treatment. Instantly the normal movement of the
household was changed. The sickroom became a mysterious centre round
which everything revolved, and the parlour, without the alteration of a
single chair, took on a deserted, forlorn appearance. Meals were eaten
like the passover, with loins girded for any sudden summons. Mrs.
Sutton and Anna, as nurses, grew important in the eyes of the men, who
instinctively effaced themselves, existing only like messenger-boys
whose business it is to await a call. Yet there was no alarm, flurry,
nor excitement. In the evening the doctor returned. The patient's
temperature had not fallen. It was part of the treatment that a
medicine should be administered every two hours with absolute
regularity, and Mrs. Sutton said that she should sit up through the
night.
