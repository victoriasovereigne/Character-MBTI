passed up the sky, the sense of universal quiescence increased.
Lovely, Anna had said. It was the loveliest sight her eyes had ever
beheld, a panorama of pure beauty transcending all imagined visions.
It overwhelmed her, thrilled her to the heart, this revelation of the
loveliness of the world. Her thoughts went back to Hanbridge and
Bursley and her life there; and all the remembered scenes, bathed in
the glow of a new ideal, seemed to lose their pain. It was as if she
had never been really unhappy, as if there was no real unhappiness on
the whole earth. She perceived that the monotony, the austerity, the
melancholy of her existence had been sweet and beautiful of its kind,
and she recalled, with a sort of rapture, hours of companionship with
the beloved Agnes, when her father was equable and pacific. Nothing
was ugly nor mean. Beauty was everywhere, in everything.
