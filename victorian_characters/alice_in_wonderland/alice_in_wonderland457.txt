`And that's the jury-box," thought Alice, `and those twelve
creatures," (she was obliged to say `creatures," you see, because
some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they
are the jurors." She said this last word two or three times over
to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and
rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the
meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just
as well.
