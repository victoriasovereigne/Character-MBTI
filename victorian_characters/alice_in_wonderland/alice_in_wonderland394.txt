All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his
head!" or `Off with her head!" Those whom she sentenced were
taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the
King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of
execution.
