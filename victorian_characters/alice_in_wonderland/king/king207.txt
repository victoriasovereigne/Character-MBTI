Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,"
she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,
and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went
to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it
in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down
the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the
beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.
