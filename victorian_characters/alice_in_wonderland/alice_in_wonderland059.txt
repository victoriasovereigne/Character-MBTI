This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be
getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!" and a Canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my
dears! It's high time you were all in bed!" On various pretexts
they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
