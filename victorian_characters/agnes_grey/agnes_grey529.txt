But, if those thoughts brought delight, it was a painful, troubled
pleasure, too near akin to anguish; and one that did me more injury than
I was aware of. It was an indulgence that a person of more wisdom or
more experience would doubtless have denied herself. And yet, how dreary
to turn my eyes from the contemplation of that bright object and force
them to dwell on the dull, grey, desolate prospect around: the joyless,
hopeless, solitary path that lay before me. It was wrong to be so
joyless, so desponding; I should have made God my friend, and to do His
will the pleasure and the business of my life; but faith was weak, and
passion was too strong.
