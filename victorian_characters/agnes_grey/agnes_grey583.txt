But I saw him at last. He came suddenly upon me as I was crossing a
field in returning from a visit to Nancy Brown, which I had taken the
opportunity of paying while Matilda Murray was riding her matchless mare.
He must have heard of the heavy loss I had sustained: he expressed no
sympathy, offered no condolence: but almost the first words he uttered
were,—‘How is your mother?’ And this was no matter-of-course question,
for I never told him that I had a mother: he must have learned the fact
from others, if he knew it at all; and, besides, there was sincere
goodwill, and even deep, touching, unobtrusive sympathy in the tone and
manner of the inquiry. I thanked him with due civility, and told him she
was as well as could be expected. ‘What will she do?’ was the next
question. Many would have deemed it an impertinent one, and given an
evasive reply; but such an idea never entered my head, and I gave a brief
but plain statement of my mother’s plans and prospects.
