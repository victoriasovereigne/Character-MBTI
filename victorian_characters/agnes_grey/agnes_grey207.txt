I did not invariably confine myself to these rules: it was against my
conscience to do so; but I seldom could venture to deviate from them in
the slightest degree, without incurring the wrath of my little pupil, and
subsequently of his mamma; to whom he would relate my transgressions
maliciously exaggerated, or adorned with embellishments of his own; and
often, in consequence, was I on the point of losing or resigning my
situation. But, for their sakes at home, I smothered my pride and
suppressed my indignation, and managed to struggle on till my little
tormentor was despatched to school; his father declaring that home
education was ‘no go; for him, it was plain; his mother spoiled him
outrageously, and his governess could make no hand of him at all.’
