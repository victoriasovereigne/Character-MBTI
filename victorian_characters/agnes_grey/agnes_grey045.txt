‘You will find them not very far advanced in their attainments,’ said
she, ‘for I have had so little time to attend to their education myself,
and we have thought them too young for a governess till now; but I think
they are clever children, and very apt to learn, especially the little
boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock—a generous, noble-spirited
boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always speaking
the truth. He seems to scorn deception’ (this was good news). ‘His
sister Mary Ann will require watching,’ continued she, ‘but she is a very
good girl upon the whole; though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery
as much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might
acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her crib to be placed
in your room, and if you will be so kind as to overlook her washing and
dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she need have nothing further
to do with the nursery maid.’
