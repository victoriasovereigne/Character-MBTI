I confess I was somewhat troubled at this change: I feared the
consequences of her displeasure, and even made some efforts to recover
the ground I had lostâ€”and with better apparent success than I could have
anticipated. At one time, I, merely in common civility, asked after her
cough; immediately her long visage relaxed into a smile, and she favoured
me with a particular history of that and her other infirmities, followed
by an account of her pious resignation, delivered in the usual emphatic,
declamatory style, which no writing can portray.
