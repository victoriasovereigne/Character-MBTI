I sometimes felt myself degraded by the life I led, and ashamed of
submitting to so many indignities; and sometimes I thought myself a fool
for caring so much about them, and feared I must be sadly wanting in
Christian humility, or that charity which ‘suffereth long and is kind,
seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, beareth all things, endureth
all things.’
