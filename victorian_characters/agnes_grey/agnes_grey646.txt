As we were strolling in the park, talking of what my companion had seen
and heard during her travelling experience, a gentleman on horseback rode
up and passed us. As he turned, in passing, and stared me full in the
face, I had a good opportunity of seeing what he was like. He was tall,
thin, and wasted, with a slight stoop in the shoulders, a pale face, but
somewhat blotchy, and disagreeably red about the eyelids, plain features,
and a general appearance of languor and flatness, relieved by a sinister
expression in the mouth and the dull, soulless eyes.
