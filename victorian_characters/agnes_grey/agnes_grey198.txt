I observed that while Mrs. Murray was so extremely solicitous for the
comfort and happiness of her children, and continually talking about it,
she never once mentioned mine; though they were at home, surrounded by
friends, and I an alien among strangers; and I did not yet know enough of
the world, not to be considerably surprised at this anomaly.
