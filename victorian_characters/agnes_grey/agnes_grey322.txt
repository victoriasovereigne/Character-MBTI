‘“Well,” says he, “Mr. Hatfield was quite right in telling you to
persevere in doing your duty; but in advising you to go to church and
attend to the service, and so on, he didn’t mean that was the whole of a
Christian’s duty: he only thought you might there learn what more was to
be done, and be led to take delight in those exercises, instead of
finding them a task and a burden. And if you had asked him to explain
those words that trouble you so much, I think he would have told you,
that if many shall seek to enter in at the strait gate and shall not be
able, it is their own sins that hinder them; just as a man with a large
sack on his back might wish to pass through a narrow doorway, and find it
impossible to do so unless he would leave his sack behind him. But you,
Nancy, I dare say, have no sins that you would not gladly throw aside, if
you knew how?”
