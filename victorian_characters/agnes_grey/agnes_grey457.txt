Mr. Hatfield had doubtless received a very severe blow; but his pride
impelled him to use every effort to conceal the effects of it. He had
been disappointed in his certain hope of obtaining not only a beautiful,
and, to him, highly attractive wife, but one whose rank and fortune might
give brilliance to far inferior charms: he was likewise, no doubt,
intensely mortified by his repulse, and deeply offended at the conduct of
Miss Murray throughout. It would have given him no little consolation to
have known how disappointed she was to find him apparently so little
moved, and to see that he was able to refrain from casting a single
glance at her throughout both services; though, she declared, it showed
he was thinking of her all the time, or his eyes would have fallen upon
her, if it were only by chance: but if they had so chanced to fall, she
would have affirmed it was because they could not resist the attraction.
It might have pleased him, too, in some degree, to have seen how dull and
dissatisfied she was throughout that week (the greater part of it, at
least), for lack of her usual source of excitement; and how often she
regretted having ‘used him up so soon,’ like a child that, having
devoured its plumcake too hastily, sits sucking its fingers, and vainly
lamenting its greediness.
