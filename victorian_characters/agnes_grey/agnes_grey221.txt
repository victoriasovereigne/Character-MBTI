‘Miss Grey,’ said she, one evening, a month before the all-important day,
as I was perusing a long and extremely interesting letter of my
sister’s—which I had just glanced at in the morning to see that it
contained no very bad news, and kept till now, unable before to find a
quiet moment for reading it,—‘Miss Grey, do put away that dull, stupid
letter, and listen to me! I’m sure my talk must be far more amusing than
that.’
