Now, also, I never walked home with my pupils: they said their mamma
thought it did not look well to see three people out of the family
walking, and only two going in the carriage; and, as they greatly
preferred walking in fine weather, I should be honoured by going with the
seniors. ‘And besides,’ said they, ‘you can’t walk as fast as we do; you
know you’re always lagging behind.’ I knew these were false excuses, but
I made no objections, and never contradicted such assertions, well
knowing the motives which dictated them. And in the afternoons, during
those six memorable weeks, I never went to church at all. If I had a
cold, or any slight indisposition, they took advantage of that to make me
stay at home; and often they would tell me they were not going again that
day, themselves, and then pretend to change their minds, and set off
without telling me: so managing their departure that I never discovered
the change of purpose till too late. Upon their return home, on one of
these occasions, they entertained me with an animated account of a
conversation they had had with Mr. Weston as they came along. ‘And he
asked if you were ill, Miss Grey,’ said Matilda; ‘but we told him you
were quite well, only you didn’t want to come to church—so he’ll think
you’re turned wicked.’
