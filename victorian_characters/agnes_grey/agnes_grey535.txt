She gave me a hasty kiss, and was hurrying away; but, suddenly returning,
embraced me with more affection than I thought her capable of evincing,
and departed with tears in her eyes. Poor girl! I really loved her
then; and forgave her from my heart all the injury she had done meâ€”and
others also: she had not half known it, I was sure; and I prayed God to
pardon her too.
