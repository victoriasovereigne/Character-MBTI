man of worse temper or less penetration would have been at such a refusal
of his aid. I could not deny the truth of his assertion, and so went
with him to the carriage; he even offered me his hand on getting in: an
unnecessary piece of civility, but I accepted that too, for fear of
giving offence. One glance he gave, one little smile at parting—it was
but for a moment; but therein I read, or thought I read, a meaning that
kindled in my heart a brighter flame of hope than had ever yet arisen.
