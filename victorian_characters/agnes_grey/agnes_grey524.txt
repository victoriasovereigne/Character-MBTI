No—besides my hope in God, my only consolation was in thinking that,
though he know it not, I was more worthy of his love than Rosalie Murray,
charming and engaging as she was; for I could appreciate his excellence,
which she could not: I would devote my life to the promotion of his
happiness; she would destroy his happiness for the momentary
gratification of her own vanity. ‘Oh, if he could but know the
difference!’ I would earnestly exclaim. ‘But no! I would not have him
see my heart: yet, if he could but know her hollowness, her worthless,
heartless frivolity, he would then be safe, and I should be—_almost_
happy, though I might never see him more!’
