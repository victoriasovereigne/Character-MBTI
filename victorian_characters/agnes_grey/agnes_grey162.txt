No one triumphed over my failure, or said I had better have taken his or
her advice, and quietly stayed at home. All were glad to have me back
again, and lavished more kindness than ever upon me, to make up for the
sufferings I had undergone; but not one would touch a shilling of what I
had so cheerfully earned and so carefully saved, in the hope of sharing
it with them. By dint of pinching here, and scraping there, our debts
were already nearly paid. Mary had had good success with her drawings;
but our father had insisted upon _her_ likewise keeping all the produce
of her industry to herself. All we could spare from the supply of our
humble wardrobe and our little casual expenses, he directed us to put
into the savingsâ€™-bank; saying, we knew not how soon we might be
dependent on that alone for support: for he felt he had not long to be
with us, and what would become of our mother and us when he was gone, God
only knew!
