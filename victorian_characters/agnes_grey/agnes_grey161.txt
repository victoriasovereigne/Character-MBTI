For a few months I remained peaceably at home, in the quiet enjoyment of
liberty and rest, and genuine friendship, from all of which I had fasted
so long; and in the earnest prosecution of my studies, to recover what I
had lost during my stay at Wellwood House, and to lay in new stores for
future use. My fatherâ€™s health was still very infirm, but not materially
worse than when I last saw him; and I was glad I had it in my power to
cheer him by my return, and to amuse him with singing his favourite
songs.
