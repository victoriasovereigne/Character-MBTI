At length I was called upon, one fine morning, to accompany her in a walk
to the village. Ostensibly she went to get some shades of Berlin wool,
at a tolerably respectable shop that was chiefly supported by the ladies
of the vicinity: really—I trust there is no breach of charity in
supposing that she went with the idea of meeting either with the Rector
himself, or some other admirer by the way; for as we went along, she kept
wondering ‘what Hatfield would do or say, if we met him,’ &c. &c.; as we
passed Mr. Green’s park-gates, she ‘wondered whether he was at home—great
stupid blockhead’; as Lady Meltham’s carriage passed us, she ‘wondered
what Mr. Harry was doing this fine day’; and then began to abuse his
elder brother for being ‘such a fool as to get married and go and live in
London.’
