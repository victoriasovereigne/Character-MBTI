‘I expect to like my parish better a year or two hence, when I have
worked certain reforms I have set my heart upon—or, at least, progressed
some steps towards such an achievement. But you may congratulate me now;
for I find it very agreeable to _have_ a parish all to myself, with
nobody to interfere with me—to thwart my plans or cripple my exertions:
and besides, I have a respectable house in a rather pleasant
neighbourhood, and three hundred pounds a year; and, in fact, I have
nothing but solitude to complain of, and nothing but a companion to wish
for.’
