‘Agnes, this sea air and change of scene do you no good, I think: I never
saw you look so wretched. It must be that you sit too much, and allow
the cares of the schoolroom to worry you. You must learn to take things
easy, and to be more active and cheerful; you must take exercise whenever
you can get it, and leave the most tiresome duties to me: they will only
serve to exercise my patience, and, perhaps, try my temper a little.’
