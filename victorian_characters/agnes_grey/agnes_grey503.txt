As I am in the way of confessions I may as well acknowledge that, about
this time, I paid more attention to dress than ever I had done before.
This is not saying much—for hitherto I had been a little neglectful in
that particular; but now, also, it was no uncommon thing to spend as much
as two minutes in the contemplation of my own image in the glass; though
I never could derive any consolation from such a study. I could discover
no beauty in those marked features, that pale hollow cheek, and ordinary
dark brown hair; there might be intellect in the forehead, there might be
expression in the dark grey eyes, but what of that?—a low Grecian brow,
and large black eyes devoid of sentiment would be esteemed far
preferable. It is foolish to wish for beauty. Sensible people never
either desire it for themselves or care about it in others. If the mind
be but well cultivated, and the heart well disposed, no one ever cares
for the exterior. So said the teachers of our childhood; and so say we
to the children of the present day. All very judicious and proper, no
doubt; but are such assertions supported by actual experience?
