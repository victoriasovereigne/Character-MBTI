‘Why, middling, Miss, i’ myseln—my eyes is no better, but I’m a deal
easier i’ my mind nor I have been,’ replied she, rising to welcome me
with a contented smile; which I was glad to see, for Nancy had been
somewhat afflicted with religious melancholy. I congratulated her upon
the change. She agreed that it was a great blessing, and expressed
herself ‘right down thankful for it’; adding, ‘If it please God to spare
my sight, and make me so as I can read my Bible again, I think I shall be
as happy as a queen.’
