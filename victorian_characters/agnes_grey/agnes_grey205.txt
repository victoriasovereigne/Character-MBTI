Her brother John, _alias_ Master Murray, was about eleven when I came: a
fine, stout, healthy boy, frank and good-natured in the main, and might
have been a decent lad had he been properly educated; but now he was as
rough as a young bear, boisterous, unruly, unprincipled, untaught,
unteachable—at least, for a governess under his mother’s eye. His
masters at school might be able to manage him better—for to school he was
sent, greatly to my relief, in the course of a year; in a state, it is
true, of scandalous ignorance as to Latin, as well as the more useful
though more neglected things: and this, doubtless, would all be laid to
the account of his education having been entrusted to an ignorant female
teacher, who had presumed to take in hand what she was wholly incompetent
to perform. I was not delivered from his brother till full twelve months
after, when he also was despatched in the same state of disgraceful
ignorance as the former.
