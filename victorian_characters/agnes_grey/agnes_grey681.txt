Here the conversation was interrupted by a water-cart lumbering past us,
for we were now come to the busy part of the sands; and, for the next
eight or ten minutes, between carts and horses, and asses, and men, there
was little room for social intercourse, till we had turned our backs upon
the sea, and begun to ascend the precipitous road leading into the town.
Here my companion offered me his arm, which I accepted, though not with
the intention of using it as a support.
