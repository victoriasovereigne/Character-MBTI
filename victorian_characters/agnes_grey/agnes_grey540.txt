Amid all this, let it not be imagined that I escaped without many a
reprimand, and many an implied reproach, that lost none of its sting from
not being openly worded; but rather wounded the more deeply, because,
from that very reason, it seemed to preclude self-defence. Frequently, I
was told to amuse Miss Matilda with other things, and to remind her of
her motherâ€™s precepts and prohibitions. I did so to the best of my
power: but she would not be amused against her will, and could not
against her taste; and though I went beyond mere reminding, such gentle
remonstrances as I could use were utterly ineffectual.
