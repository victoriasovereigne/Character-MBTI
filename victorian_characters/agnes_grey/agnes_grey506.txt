Now, therefore, let us return to Miss Murray. She accompanied her mamma
to the ball on Tuesday; of course splendidly attired, and delighted with
her prospects and her charms. As Ashby Park was nearly ten miles distant
from Horton Lodge, they had to set out pretty early, and I intended to
have spent the evening with Nancy Brown, whom I had not seen for a long
time; but my kind pupil took care I should spend it neither there nor
anywhere else beyond the limits of the schoolroom, by giving me a piece
of music to copy, which kept me closely occupied till bed-time. About
eleven next morning, as soon as she had left her room, she came to tell
me her news. Sir Thomas had indeed proposed to her at the ball; an event
which reflected great credit on her mammaâ€™s sagacity, if not upon her
skill in contrivance. I rather incline to the belief that she had first
laid her plans, and then predicted their success. The offer had been
accepted, of course, and the bridegroom elect was coming that day to
settle matters with Mr. Murray.
