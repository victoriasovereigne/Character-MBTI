Thus, I could not but conclude that Mr. Hatfield was one of those who
‘bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them upon men’s
shoulders, while they themselves will not move them with one of their
fingers’; and who ‘make the word of God of none effect by their
traditions, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.’ I was well
pleased to observe that the new curate resembled him, as far as I could
see, in none of these particulars.
