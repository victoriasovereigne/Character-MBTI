This was a very foolish answer, but the truth was, I considered that I
had no right to invite anyone to my mother’s house without her knowledge;
and if I had said, ‘Yes, if my mother does not object,’ it would appear
as if by his question I understood more than was expected; so,
_supposing_ she would not, I added, ‘I suppose so:’ but of course I
should have said something more sensible and more polite, if I had had my
wits about me. We continued our walk for a minute in silence; which,
however, was shortly relieved (no small relief to me) by Mr. Weston
commenting upon the brightness of the morning and the beauty of the bay,
and then upon the advantages A--- possessed over many other fashionable
places of resort.
