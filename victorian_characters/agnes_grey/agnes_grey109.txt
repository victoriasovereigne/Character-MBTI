I particularly remember one wild, snowy afternoon, soon after my return
in January: the children had all come up from dinner, loudly declaring
that they meant ‘to be naughty;’ and they had well kept their resolution,
though I had talked myself hoarse, and wearied every muscle in my throat,
in the vain attempt to reason them out of it. I had got Tom pinned up in
a corner, whence, I told him, he should not escape till he had done his
appointed task. Meantime, Fanny had possessed herself of my work-bag,
and was rifling its contents—and spitting into it besides. I told her to
let it alone, but to no purpose, of course. ‘Burn it, Fanny!’ cried Tom:
and _this_ command she hastened to obey. I sprang to snatch it from the
fire, and Tom darted to the door. ‘Mary Ann, throw her desk out of the
window!’ cried he: and my precious desk, containing my letters and
papers, my small amount of cash, and all my valuables, was about to be
precipitated from the three-storey window. I flew to rescue it.
Meanwhile Tom had left the room, and was rushing down the stairs,
followed by Fanny. Having secured my desk, I ran to catch them, and Mary
Ann came scampering after. All three escaped me, and ran out of the
house into the garden, where they plunged about in the snow, shouting and
screaming in exultant glee.
