‘Yes, Edward Weston, I could indeed be happy in a house full of enemies,
if I had but one friend, who truly, deeply, and faithfully loved me; and
if that friend were you—though we might be far apart—seldom to hear from
each other, still more seldom to meet—though toil, and trouble, and
vexation might surround me, still—it would be too much happiness for me
to dream of! Yet who can tell,’ said I within myself, as I proceeded up
the park,—‘who can tell what this one month may bring forth? I have
lived nearly three-and-twenty years, and I have suffered much, and tasted
little pleasure yet; is it likely my life all through will be so clouded?
Is it not possible that God may hear my prayers, disperse these gloomy
shadows, and grant me some beams of heaven’s sunshine yet? Will He
entirely deny to me those blessings which are so freely given to others,
who neither ask them nor acknowledge them when received? May I not still
hope and trust? I did hope and trust for a while: but, alas, alas! the
time ebbed away: one week followed another, and, excepting one distant
glimpse and two transient meetings—during which scarcely anything was
said—while I was walking with Miss Matilda, I saw nothing of him: except,
of course, at church.
