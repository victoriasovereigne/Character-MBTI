I went to get ready, and was down again in a few minutes; though, of
course, I took a little more pains with my attire than if I had merely
been going out on some shopping expedition alone. The thunder-shower had
certainly had a most beneficial effect upon the weather, and the evening
was most delightful. Mr. Weston would have me to take his arm; he said
little during our passage through the crowded streets, but walked very
fast, and appeared grave and abstracted. I wondered what was the matter,
and felt an indefinite dread that something unpleasant was on his mind;
and vague surmises, concerning what it might be, troubled me not a
little, and made me grave and silent enough. But these fantasies
vanished upon reaching the quiet outskirts of the town; for as soon as we
came within sight of the venerable old church, and theâ€”hill, with the
deep blue beyond it, I found my companion was cheerful enough.
