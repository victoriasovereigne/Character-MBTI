‘I mean to take up Mr. Weston instead of Mr. Hatfield,’ said my
companion, after a short pause, resuming something of her usual
cheerfulness. ‘The ball at Ashby Park takes place on Tuesday, you know;
and mamma thinks it very likely that Sir Thomas will propose to me then:
such things are often done in the privacy of the ball-room, when
gentlemen are most easily ensnared, and ladies most enchanting. But if I
am to be married so soon, I must make the best of the present time: I am
determined Hatfield shall not be the only man who shall lay his heart at
my feet, and implore me to accept the worthless gift in vain.’
