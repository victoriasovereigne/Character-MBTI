‘I can see better here, thank you, Nancy,’ replied I, taking my work to
the window, where she had the goodness to suffer me to remain unmolested,
while she got a brush to remove the cat’s hairs from Mr. Weston’s coat,
carefully wiped the rain from his hat, and gave the cat its supper,
busily talking all the time: now thanking her clerical friend for what he
had done; now wondering how the cat had found out the warren; and now
lamenting the probable consequences of such a discovery. He listened
with a quiet, good-natured smile, and at length took a seat in compliance
with her pressing invitations, but repeated that he did not mean to stay.
