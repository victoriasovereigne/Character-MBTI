Miss Matilda, a strapping hoyden of about fourteen, with a short frock
and trousers, shrugged her shoulders and made a slight grimace, but took
a candle and proceeded before me up the back stairs (a long, steep,
double flight), and through a long, narrow passage, to a small but
tolerably comfortable room. She then asked me if I would take some tea
or coffee. I was about to answer No; but remembering that I had taken
nothing since seven o’clock that morning, and feeling faint in
consequence, I said I would take a cup of tea. Saying she would tell
‘Brown,’ the young lady departed; and by the time I had divested myself
of my heavy, wet cloak, shawl, bonnet, &c., a mincing damsel came to say
the young ladies desired to know whether I would take my tea up there or
in the schoolroom. Under the plea of fatigue I chose to take it there.
She withdrew; and, after a while, returned again with a small tea-tray,
and placed it on the chest of drawers, which served as a dressing-table.
Having civilly thanked her, I asked at what time I should be expected to
rise in the morning.
