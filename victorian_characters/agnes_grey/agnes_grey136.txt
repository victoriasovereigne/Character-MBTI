Besides the old lady, there was another relative of the family, whose
visits were a great annoyance to me—this was ‘Uncle Robson,’ Mrs.
Bloomfield’s brother; a tall, self-sufficient fellow, with dark hair and
sallow complexion like his sister, a nose that seemed to disdain the
earth, and little grey eyes, frequently half-closed, with a mixture of
real stupidity and affected contempt of all surrounding objects. He was
a thick-set, strongly-built man, but he had found some means of
compressing his waist into a remarkably small compass; and that, together
with the unnatural stillness of his form, showed that the lofty-minded,
manly Mr. Robson, the scorner of the female sex, was not above the
foppery of stays. He seldom deigned to notice me; and, when he did, it
was with a certain supercilious insolence of tone and manner that
convinced me he was no gentleman: though it was intended to have a
contrary effect. But it was not for that I disliked his coming, so much
as for the harm he did the children—encouraging all their evil
propensities, and undoing in a few minutes the little good it had taken
me months of labour to achieve.
