I descended to the schoolroom with no remarkable eagerness to join my
pupils, though not without some feeling of curiosity respecting what a
further acquaintance would reveal. One thing, among others of more
obvious importance, I determined with myselfâ€”I must begin with calling
them Miss and Master. It seemed to me a chilling and unnatural piece of
punctilio between the children of a family and their instructor and daily
companion; especially where the former were in their early childhood, as
at Wellwood House; but even there, my calling the little Bloomfields by
their simple names had been regarded as an offensive liberty: as their
parents had taken care to show me, by carefully designating them _Master_
and _Miss_ Bloomfield, &c., in speaking to me. I had been very slow to
take the hint, because the whole affair struck me as so very absurd; but
now I determined to be wiser, and begin at once with as much form and
ceremony as any member of the family would be likely to require: and,
indeed, the children being so much older, there would be less difficulty;
though the little words Miss and Master seemed to have a surprising
effect in repressing all familiar, open-hearted kindness, and
extinguishing every gleam of cordiality that might arise between us.
