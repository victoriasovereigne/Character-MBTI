Miss Murray ordered the carriage again, in the afternoon, for herself and
her sister: she said it was too cold for them to enjoy themselves in the
garden; and besides, she believed Harry Meltham would be at church.
‘For,’ said she, smiling slyly at her own fair image in the glass, ‘he
has been a most exemplary attendant at church these last few Sundays: you
would think he was quite a good Christian. And you may go with us, Miss
Grey: I want you to see him; he is so greatly improved since he returned
from abroad—you can’t think! And besides, then you will have an
opportunity of seeing the beautiful Mr. Weston again, and of hearing him
preach.’
