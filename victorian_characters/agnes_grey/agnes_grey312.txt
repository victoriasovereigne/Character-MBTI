‘But one Sunday, when Maister Hatfield gave out about the sacrament, I
noticed where he said, “If there be any of you that cannot quiet his own
conscience, but requireth further comfort or counsel, let him come to me,
or some other discreet and learned minister of God’s word, and open his
grief!” So next Sunday morning, afore service, I just looked into the
vestry, an’ began a-talking to th’ Rector again. I hardly could fashion
to take such a liberty, but I thought when my soul was at stake I
shouldn’t stick at a trifle. But he said he hadn’t time to attend to me
then.
