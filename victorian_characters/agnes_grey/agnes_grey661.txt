Presently, I heard a snuffling sound behind me and then a dog came
frisking and wriggling to my feet. It was my own Snap—the little dark,
wire-haired terrier! When I spoke his name, he leapt up in my face and
yelled for joy. Almost as much delighted as himself, I caught the little
creature in my arms, and kissed him repeatedly. But how came he to be
there? He could not have dropped from the sky, or come all that way
alone: it must be either his master, the rat-catcher, or somebody else
that had brought him; so, repressing my extravagant caresses, and
endeavouring to repress his likewise, I looked round, and beheld—Mr.
Weston!
