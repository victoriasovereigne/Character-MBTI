But all my exhortations were in vain: they only made her somewhat more
solicitous to disguise her wishes and her thoughts from me. She talked
no more to me about the Rector; but I could see that her mind, if not her
heart, was fixed upon him still, and that she was intent upon obtaining
another interview: for though, in compliance with her motherâ€™s request, I
was now constituted the companion of her rambles for a time, she still
persisted in wandering in the fields and lanes that lay in the nearest
proximity to the road; and, whether she talked to me or read the book she
carried in her hand, she kept continually pausing to look round her, or
gaze up the road to see if anyone was coming; and if a horseman trotted
by, I could tell by her unqualified abuse of the poor equestrian, whoever
he might be, that she hated him _because_ he was not Mr. Hatfield.
