Miss Murray made several trivial observations as we passed up the park,
to which (in spite of my reluctance to let one glimpse of my feelings
appear) I could only answer by monosyllables. Whether she intended to
torment me, or merely to amuse herself, I could not tellâ€”and did not much
care; but I thought of the poor man and his one lamb, and the rich man
with his thousand flocks; and I dreaded I knew not what for Mr. Weston,
independently of my own blighted hopes.
