When we had surmounted the acclivity, I was about to withdraw my arm from
his, but by a slight tightening of the elbow was tacitly informed that
such was not his will, and accordingly desisted. Discoursing on
different subjects, we entered the town, and passed through several
streets. I saw that he was going out of his way to accompany me,
notwithstanding the long walk that was yet before him; and, fearing that
he might be inconveniencing himself from motives of politeness, I
observed—‘I fear I am taking you out of your way, Mr. Weston—I believe
the road to F--- lies quite in another direction.’
