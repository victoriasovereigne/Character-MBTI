After that, he turned the conversation to more general subjects. He did
not leave me till we had nearly reached the park-gates: he had certainly
stepped a little out of his way to accompany me so far, for he now went
back and disappeared down Moss Lane, the entrance of which we had passed
some time before. Assuredly I did not regret this circumstance: if
sorrow had any place in my heart, it was that he was gone at last—that he
was no longer walking by my side, and that that short interval of
delightful intercourse was at an end. He had not breathed a word of
love, or dropped one hint of tenderness or affection, and yet I had been
supremely happy. To be near him, to hear him talk as he did talk, and to
feel that he thought me worthy to be so spoken to—capable of
understanding and duly appreciating such discourse—was enough.
