I fear, by this time, the reader is well nigh disgusted with the folly
and weakness I have so freely laid before him. I never disclosed it
then, and would not have done so had my own sister or my mother been with
me in the house. I was a close and resolute dissemblerâ€”in this one case
at least. My prayers, my tears, my wishes, fears, and lamentations, were
witnessed by myself and heaven alone.
