I came down a little before eight, next morning, as I knew by the
striking of a distant clock. There was no appearance of breakfast. I
waited above an hour before it came, still vainly longing for access to
the library; and, after that lonely repast was concluded, I waited again
about an hour and a half in great suspense and discomfort, uncertain what
to do. At length Lady Ashby came to bid me good-morning. She informed
me she had only just breakfasted, and now wanted me to take an early walk
with her in the park. She asked how long I had been up, and on receiving
my answer, expressed the deepest regret, and again promised to show me
the library. I suggested she had better do so at once, and then there
would be no further trouble either with remembering or forgetting. She
complied, on condition that I would not think of reading, or bothering
with the books now; for she wanted to show me the gardens, and take a
walk in the park with me, before it became too hot for enjoyment; which,
indeed, was nearly the case already. Of course I readily assented; and
we took our walk accordingly.
