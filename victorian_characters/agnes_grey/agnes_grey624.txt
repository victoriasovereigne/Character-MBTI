The drawing-room was certainly an imposing apartment, and very elegantly
furnished; but I saw its young mistress glance towards me as we entered,
as if to notice how I was impressed by the spectacle, and accordingly I
determined to preserve an aspect of stony indifference, as if I saw
nothing at all remarkable. But this was only for a moment: immediately
conscience whispered, ‘Why should I disappoint her to save my pride?
No—rather let me sacrifice my pride to give her a little innocent
gratification.’ And I honestly looked round, and told her it was a noble
room, and very tastefully furnished. She said little, but I saw she was
pleased.
