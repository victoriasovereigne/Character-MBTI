To begin with the head: Mr. Murray was, by all accounts, a blustering,
roystering, country squire: a devoted fox-hunter, a skilful horse-jockey
and farrier, an active, practical farmer, and a hearty _bon vivant_. By
all accounts, I say; for, except on Sundays, when he went to church, I
never saw him from month to month: unless, in crossing the hall or
walking in the grounds, the figure of a tall, stout gentleman, with
scarlet cheeks and crimson nose, happened to come across me; on which
occasions, if he passed near enough to speak, an unceremonious nod,
accompanied by a ‘Morning, Miss Grey,’ or some such brief salutation, was
usually vouchsafed. Frequently, indeed, his loud laugh reached me from
afar; and oftener still I heard him swearing and blaspheming against the
footmen, groom, coachman, or some other hapless dependant.
