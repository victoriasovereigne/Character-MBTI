‘No matter; I should like it better if it were a boy—only that its father
will leave it no inheritance that he can possibly squander away. What
pleasure can I have in seeing a girl grow up to eclipse me, and enjoy
those pleasures that I am for ever debarred from? But supposing I could
be so generous as to take delight in this, still it is _only_ a child;
and I can’t centre all my hopes in a child: that is only one degree
better than devoting oneself to a dog. And as for all the wisdom and
goodness you have been trying to instil into me—that is all very right
and proper, I daresay, and if I were some twenty years older, I might
fructify by it: but people must enjoy themselves when they are young; and
if others won’t let them—why, they must hate them for it!’
