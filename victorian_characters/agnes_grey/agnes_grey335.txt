Already, I seemed to feel my intellect deteriorating, my heart
petrifying, my soul contracting; and I trembled lest my very moral
perceptions should become deadened, my distinctions of right and wrong
confounded, and all my better faculties be sunk, at last, beneath the
baneful influence of such a mode of life. The gross vapours of earth
were gathering around me, and closing in upon my inward heaven; and thus
it was that Mr. Weston rose at length upon me, appearing like the morning
star in my horizon, to save me from the fear of utter darkness; and I
rejoiced that I had now a subject for contemplation that was above me,
not beneath. I was glad to see that all the world was not made up of
Bloomfields, Murrays, Hatfields, Ashbys, &c.; and that human excellence
was not a mere dream of the imagination. When we hear a little good and
no harm of a person, it is easy and pleasant to imagine more: in short,
it is needless to analyse all my thoughts; but Sunday was now become a
day of peculiar delight to me (I was now almost broken-in to the back
corner in the carriage), for I liked to hear himâ€”and I liked to see him,
too; though I knew he was not handsome, or even what is called agreeable,
in outward aspect; but, certainly, he was not ugly.
