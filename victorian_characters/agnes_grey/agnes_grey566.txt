But alas! that very morning, my flickering flame of hope was dismally
quenched by a letter from my mother, which spoke so seriously of my
father’s increasing illness, that I feared there was little or no chance
of his recovery; and, close at hand as the holidays were, I almost
trembled lest they should come too late for me to meet him in this world.
Two days after, a letter from Mary told me his life was despaired of, and
his end seemed fast approaching. Then, immediately, I sought permission
to anticipate the vacation, and go without delay. Mrs. Murray stared,
and wondered at the unwonted energy and boldness with which I urged the
request, and thought there was no occasion to hurry; but finally gave me
leave: stating, however, that there was ‘no need to be in such agitation
about the matter—it might prove a false alarm after all; and if not—why,
it was only in the common course of nature: we must all die some time;
and I was not to suppose myself the only afflicted person in the world;’
and concluding with saying I might have the phaeton to take me to O---.
‘And instead of _repining_, Miss Grey, be thankful for the _privileges_
you enjoy. There’s many a poor clergyman whose family would be plunged
into ruin by the event of his death; but you, you see, have influential
friends ready to continue their patronage, and to show you every
consideration.’
