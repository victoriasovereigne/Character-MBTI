On another occasion, I pretended to forget the whole affair; and talked
and played with her as usual, till night, when I put her to bed; then
bending over her, while she lay all smiles and good humour, just before
departing, I said, as cheerfully and kindly as before—‘Now, Mary Ann,
just tell me that word before I kiss you good-night. You are a good girl
now, and, of course, you will say it.’
