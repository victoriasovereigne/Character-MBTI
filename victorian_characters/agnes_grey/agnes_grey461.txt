Amid all this, I confess, I wondered, too, in secret, whether we should
meet, or catch a glimpse of somebody else; and as we passed his lodgings,
I even went so far as to wonder whether he was at the window. On
entering the shop, Miss Murray desired me to stand in the doorway while
she transacted her business, and tell her if anyone passed. But alas!
there was no one visible besides the villagers, except Jane and Susan
Green coming down the single street, apparently returning from a walk.
