But, with time and patience, matters began to be slightly ameliorated:
slowly, it is true, and almost imperceptibly; but I got rid of my male
pupils (that was no trifling advantage), and the girls, as I intimated
before concerning one of them, became a little less insolent, and began
to show some symptoms of esteem. ‘Miss Grey was a queer creature: she
never flattered, and did not praise them half enough; but whenever she
did speak favourably of them, or anything belonging to them, they could
be quite sure her approbation was sincere. She was very obliging, quiet,
and peaceable in the main, but there were some things that put her out of
temper: they did not much care for that, to be sure, but still it was
better to keep her in tune; as when she was in a good humour she would
talk to them, and be very agreeable and amusing sometimes, in her way;
which was quite different to mamma’s, but still very well for a change.
She had her own opinions on every subject, and kept steadily to them—very
tiresome opinions they often were; as she was always thinking of what was
right and what was wrong, and had a strange reverence for matters
connected with religion, and an unaccountable liking to good people.’
