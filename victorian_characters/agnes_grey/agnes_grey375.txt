We now approached a stile communicating with a footpath that conducted to
a farm-house, where, I suppose, Mr. Weston purposed to make himself
‘useful;’ for he presently took leave of me, crossed the stile, and
traversed the path with his usual firm, elastic tread, leaving me to
ponder his words as I continued my course alone. I had heard before that
he had lost his mother not many months before he came. She then was the
last and dearest of his early friends; and he had _no home_. I pitied
him from my heart: I almost wept for sympathy. And this, I thought,
accounted for the shade of premature thoughtfulness that so frequently
clouded his brow, and obtained for him the reputation of a morose and
sullen disposition with the charitable Miss Murray and all her kin.
‘But,’ thought I, ‘he is not so miserable as I should be under such a
deprivation: he leads an active life; and a wide field for useful
exertion lies before him. He can _make_ friends; and he can make a home
too, if he pleases; and, doubtless, he will please some time. God grant
the partner of that home may be worthy of his choice, and make it a happy
one—such a home as he deserves to have! And how delightful it would be
to—’ But no matter what I thought.
