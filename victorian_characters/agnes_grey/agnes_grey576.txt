Mary offered to lend the little she possessed; but my mother declined it,
saying that we must begin on an economical plan; and she hoped that the
whole or part of mine, added to what we could get by the sale of the
furniture, and what little our dear papa had contrived to lay aside for
her since the debts were paid, would be sufficient to last us till
Christmas; when, it was hoped, something would accrue from our united
labours. It was finally settled that this should be our plan; and that
inquiries and preparations should immediately be set on foot; and while
my mother busied herself with these, I should return to Horton Lodge at
the close of my four weeksâ€™ vacation, and give notice for my final
departure when things were in train for the speedy commencement of our
school.
