I thanked her for her ‘consideration,’ and flew to my room to make some
hurried preparations for my departure. My bonnet and shawl being on, and
a few things hastily crammed into my largest trunk, I descended. But I
might have done the work more leisurely, for no one else was in a hurry;
and I had still a considerable time to wait for the phaeton. At length
it came to the door, and I was off: but, oh, what a dreary journey was
that! how utterly different from my former passages homewards! Being too
late for the last coach to ---, I had to hire a cab for ten miles, and
then a car to take me over the rugged hills.
