The 31st of January was a wild, tempestuous day: there was a strong north
wind, with a continual storm of snow drifting on the ground and whirling
through the air. My friends would have had me delay my departure, but
fearful of prejudicing my employers against me by such want of
punctuality at the commencement of my undertaking, I persisted in keeping
the appointment.
