I showed this strange epistle to my mother, and consulted her on what I
ought to do. She advised me to go; and I went—willing enough to see Lady
Ashby, and her baby, too, and to do anything I could to benefit her, by
consolation or advice; for I imagined she must be unhappy, or she would
not have applied to me thus—but feeling, as may readily be conceived,
that, in accepting the invitation, I made a great sacrifice for her, and
did violence to my feelings in many ways, instead of being delighted with
the honourable distinction of being entreated by the baronet’s lady to
visit her as a friend. However, I determined my visit should be only for
a few days at most; and I will not deny that I derived some consolation
from the idea that, as Ashby Park was not very far from Horton, I might
possibly see Mr. Weston, or, at least, hear something about him.
