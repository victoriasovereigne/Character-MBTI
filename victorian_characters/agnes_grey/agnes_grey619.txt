its shelves, but, I daresay, it is full of wise books; and you may go and
burrow among them whenever you please. And now you shall have some

dine at one, you would perhaps like better to have a cup of tea about
this time, and to dine when we lunch: and then, you know, you can have
your tea in this room, and that will save you from having to dine with
Lady Ashby and Sir Thomas: which would be rather awkward—at least, not
awkward, but rather—a—you know what I mean. I thought you mightn’t like
it so well—especially as we may have other ladies and gentlemen to dine
with us occasionally.’
