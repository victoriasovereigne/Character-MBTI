‘Oh, yes; very much indeed,’ replied I; for I had now discovered that it
was Harry Meltham she meant, not Mr. Weston. That gentleman had eagerly
come forward to speak to the young ladies: a thing he would hardly have
ventured to do had their mother been present; he had likewise politely
handed them into the carriage. He had not attempted to shut me out, like
Mr. Hatfield; neither, of course, had he offered me his assistance (I
should not have accepted it, if he had), but as long as the door remained
open he had stood smirking and chatting with them, and then lifted his
hat and departed to his own abode: but I had scarcely noticed him all the
time. My companions, however, had been more observant; and, as we rolled
along, they discussed between them not only his looks, words, and
actions, but every feature of his face, and every article of his apparel.
