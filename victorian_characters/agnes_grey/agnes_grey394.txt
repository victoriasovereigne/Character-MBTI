‘But why can’t she read it in the park or the garden?—why should she go
into the fields and lanes? And how is it that that Mr. Hatfield so often
finds her out? She told me last week he’d walked his horse by her side
all up Moss Lane; and now I’m sure it was he I saw, from my dressing-room
window, walking so briskly past the park-gates, and on towards the field
where she so frequently goes. I wish you would go and see if she is
there; and just gently remind her that it is not proper for a young lady
of her rank and prospects to be wandering about by herself in that
manner, exposed to the attentions of anyone that presumes to address her;
like some poor neglected girl that has no park to walk in, and no friends
to take care of her: and tell her that her papa would be extremely angry
if he knew of her treating Mr. Hatfield in the familiar manner that I
fear she does; and—oh! if you—if _any_ governess had but half a mother’s
watchfulness—half a mother’s anxious care, I should be saved this
trouble; and you would see at once the necessity of keeping your eye upon
her, and making your company agreeable to— Well, go—go; there’s no time
to be lost,’ cried she, seeing that I had put away my drawing materials,
and was waiting in the doorway for the conclusion of her address.
