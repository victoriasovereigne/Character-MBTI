So saying—urged by a sense of duty—at the risk of both making myself sick
and incurring the wrath of my employers—I got a large flat stone, that
had been reared up for a mouse-trap by the gardener; then, having once
more vainly endeavoured to persuade the little tyrant to let the birds be
carried back, I asked what he intended to do with them. With fiendish
glee he commenced a list of torments; and while he was busied in the
relation, I dropped the stone upon his intended victims and crushed them
flat beneath it. Loud were the outcries, terrible the execrations,
consequent upon this daring outrage; uncle Robson had been coming up the
walk with his gun, and was just then pausing to kick his dog. Tom flew
towards him, vowing he would make him kick me instead of Juno. Mr.
Robson leant upon his gun, and laughed excessively at the violence of his
nephew’s passion, and the bitter maledictions and opprobrious epithets he
heaped upon me. ‘Well, you _are_ a good ’un!’ exclaimed he, at length,
taking up his weapon and proceeding towards the house. ‘Damme, but the
lad has some spunk in him, too. Curse me, if ever I saw a nobler little
scoundrel than that. He’s beyond petticoat government already: by God!
he defies mother, granny, governess, and all! Ha, ha, ha! Never mind,
Tom, I’ll get you another brood to-morrow.’
