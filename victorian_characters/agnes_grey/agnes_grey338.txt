The next visit I paid to Nancy Brown was in the second week in March:
for, though I had many spare minutes during the day, I seldom could look
upon an hour as entirely my own; since, where everything was left to the
caprices of Miss Matilda and her sister, there could be no order or
regularity. Whatever occupation I chose, when not actually busied about
them or their concerns, I had, as it were, to keep my loins girded, my
shoes on my feet, and my staff in my hand; for not to be immediately
forthcoming when called for, was regarded as a grave and inexcusable
offence: not only by my pupils and their mother, but by the very servant,
who came in breathless haste to call me, exclaiming, ‘You’re to go to the
schoolroom _directly_, mum, the young ladies is WAITING!!’ Climax of
horror! actually waiting for their governess!!!
