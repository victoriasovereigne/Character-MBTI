When her lessons were over, however, her ill-humour was generally over
too: while riding her spirited pony, or romping with the dogs or her
brothers and sister, but especially with her dear brother John, she was
as happy as a lark. As an animal, Matilda was all right, full of life,
vigour, and activity; as an intelligent being, she was barbarously
ignorant, indocile, careless and irrational; and, consequently, very
distressing to one who had the task of cultivating her understanding,
reforming her manners, and aiding her to acquire those ornamental
attainments which, unlike her sister, she despised as much as the rest.
Her mother was partly aware of her deficiencies, and gave me many a
lecture as to how I should try to form her tastes, and endeavour to rouse
and cherish her dormant vanity; and, by insinuating, skilful flattery, to
win her attention to the desired objectsâ€”which I would not do; and how I
should prepare and smooth the path of learning till she could glide along
it without the least exertion to herself: which I could not, for nothing
can be taught to any purpose without some little exertion on the part of
the learner.
