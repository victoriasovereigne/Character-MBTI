My task of instruction and surveillance, instead of becoming easier as my
charges and I got better accustomed to each other, became more arduous as
their characters unfolded. The name of governess, I soon found, was a
mere mockery as applied to me: my pupils had no more notion of obedience
than a wild, unbroken colt. The habitual fear of their father’s peevish
temper, and the dread of the punishments he was wont to inflict when
irritated, kept them generally within bounds in his immediate presence.
The girls, too, had some fear of their mother’s anger; and the boy might
occasionally be bribed to do as she bid him by the hope of reward; but I
had no rewards to offer; and as for punishments, I was given to
understand, the parents reserved that privilege to themselves; and yet
they expected me to keep my pupils in order. Other children might be
guided by the fear of anger and the desire of approbation; but neither
the one nor the other had any effect upon these.
