In stature he was a little, a very little, above the middle size; the
outline of his face would be pronounced too square for beauty, but to me
it announced decision of character; his dark brown hair was not carefully
curled, like Mr. Hatfield’s, but simply brushed aside over a broad white
forehead; the eyebrows, I suppose, were too projecting, but from under
those dark brows there gleamed an eye of singular power, brown in colour,
not large, and somewhat deep-set, but strikingly brilliant, and full of
expression; there was character, too, in the mouth, something that
bespoke a man of firm purpose and an habitual thinker; and when he
smiled—but I will not speak of that yet, for, at the time I mention, I
had never seen him smile: and, indeed, his general appearance did not
impress me with the idea of a man given to such a relaxation, nor of such
an individual as the cottagers described him. I had early formed my
opinion of him; and, in spite of Miss Murray’s objurgations: was fully
convinced that he was a man of strong sense, firm faith, and ardent
piety, but thoughtful and stern: and when I found that, to his other good
qualities, was added that of true benevolence and gentle, considerate
kindness, the discovery, perhaps, delighted me the more, as I had not
been prepared to expect it.
