Her sister was slightly offended; but the event proved Matilda was right:
the disappointed lover performed his pastoral duties as usual. Rosalie,
indeed, affirmed he looked very pale and dejected: he might be a little
paler; but the difference, if any, was scarcely perceptible. As for his
dejection, I certainly did not hear his laugh ringing from the vestry as
usual, nor his voice loud in hilarious discourse; though I did hear it
uplifted in rating the sexton in a manner that made the congregation
stare; and, in his transits to and from the pulpit and the
communion-table, there was more of solemn pomp, and less of that
irreverent, self-confident, or rather self-delighted imperiousness with
which he usually swept along—that air that seemed to say, ‘You all
reverence and adore me, I know; but if anyone does not, I defy him to the
teeth!’ But the most remarkable change was, that he never once suffered
his eyes to wander in the direction of Mr. Murray’s pew, and did not
leave the church till we were gone.
