‘Oh, I don’t mind his being wicked: he’s all the better for that; and as
for disliking him—I shouldn’t greatly object to being Lady Ashby of Ashby
Park, if I must marry. But if I could be always young, I would be always
single. I should like to enjoy myself thoroughly, and coquet with all
the world, till I am on the verge of being called an old maid; and then,
to escape the infamy of that, after having made ten thousand conquests,
to break all their hearts save one, by marrying some high-born, rich,
indulgent husband, whom, on the other hand, fifty ladies were dying to
have.’
