Ceremony was quickly dropped between us: Mr. Weston came as an expected
guest, welcome at all times, and never deranging the economy of our
household affairs. He even called me ‘Agnes:’ the name had been timidly
spoken at first, but, finding it gave no offence in any quarter, he
seemed greatly to prefer that appellation to ‘Miss Grey;’ and so did I.
How tedious and gloomy were those days in which he did not come! And yet
not miserable; for I had still the remembrance of the last visit and the
hope of the next to cheer me. But when two or three days passed without
my seeing him, I certainly felt very anxious—absurdly, unreasonably so;
for, of course, he had his own business and the affairs of his parish to
attend to. And I dreaded the close of the holidays, when _my_ business
also would begin, and I should be sometimes unable to see him, and
sometimes—when my mother was in the schoolroom—obliged to be with him
alone: a position I did not at all desire, in the house; though to meet
him out of doors, and walk beside him, had proved by no means
disagreeable.
