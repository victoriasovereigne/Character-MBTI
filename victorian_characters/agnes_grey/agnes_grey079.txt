Master Tom, not content with refusing to be ruled, must needs set up as a
ruler, and manifested a determination to keep, not only his sisters, but
his governess in order, by violent manual and pedal applications; and, as
he was a tall, strong boy of his years, this occasioned no trifling
inconvenience. A few sound boxes on the ear, on such occasions, might
have settled the matter easily enough: but as, in that case, he might
make up some story to his mother which she would be sure to believe, as
she had such unshaken faith in his veracity—though I had already
discovered it to be by no means unimpeachable—I determined to refrain
from striking him, even in self-defence; and, in his most violent moods,
my only resource was to throw him on his back and hold his hands and feet
till the frenzy was somewhat abated. To the difficulty of preventing him
from doing what he ought not, was added that of forcing him to do what he
ought. Often he would positively refuse to learn, or to repeat his
lessons, or even to look at his book. Here, again, a good birch rod
might have been serviceable; but, as my powers were so limited, I must
make the best use of what I had.
