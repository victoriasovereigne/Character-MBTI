‘Just for all the world!’ exclaimed his wife; ‘an’ about a three wik
sin’, when he seed how poor Jem shivered wi’ cold, an’ what pitiful fires
we kept, he axed if wer stock of coals was nearly done. I telled him it
was, an’ we was ill set to get more: but you know, mum, I didn’t think o’
him helping us; but, howsever, he sent us a sack o’ coals next day; an’
we’ve had good fires ever sin’: and a great blessing it is, this winter
time. But that’s his way, Miss Grey: when he comes into a poor body’s
house a-seein’ sick folk, he like notices what they most stand i’ need
on; an’ if he thinks they can’t readily get it therseln, he never says
nowt about it, but just gets it for ’em. An’ it isn’t everybody ’at ’ud
do that, ’at has as little as he has: for you know, mum, he’s nowt at all
to live on but what he gets fra’ th’ Rector, an’ that’s little enough
they say.’
