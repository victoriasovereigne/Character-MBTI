Ashby Park was certainly a very delightful residence. The mansion was
stately without, commodious and elegant within; the park was spacious and
beautiful, chiefly on account of its magnificent old trees, its stately
herds of deer, its broad sheet of water, and the ancient woods that
stretched beyond it: for there was no broken ground to give variety to
the landscape, and but very little of that undulating swell which adds so
greatly to the charm of park scenery. And so, this was the place Rosalie
Murray had so longed to call her own, that she must have a share of it,
on whatever terms it might be offeredâ€”whatever price was to be paid for
the title of mistress, and whoever was to be her partner in the honour
and bliss of such a possession! Well I am not disposed to censure her
now.
