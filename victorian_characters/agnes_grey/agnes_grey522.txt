It was no use beginning to dispute with such indulged, unreasoning
creatures: so I held my peace. I was accustomed, now, to keeping silence
when things distasteful to my ear were uttered; and now, too, I was used
to wearing a placid smiling countenance when my heart was bitter within
me. Only those who have felt the like can imagine my feelings, as I sat
with an assumption of smiling indifference, listening to the accounts of
those meetings and interviews with Mr. Weston, which they seemed to find
such pleasure in describing to me; and hearing things asserted of him
which, from the character of the man, I knew to be exaggerations and
perversions of the truth, if not entirely false—things derogatory to him,
and flattering to them—especially to Miss Murray—which I burned to
contradict, or, at least, to show my doubts about, but dared not; lest,
in expressing my disbelief, I should display my interest too. Other
things I heard, which I felt or feared were indeed too true: but I must
still conceal my anxiety respecting him, my indignation against them,
beneath a careless aspect; others, again, mere hints of something said or
done, which I longed to hear more of, but could not venture to inquire.
So passed the weary time. I could not even comfort myself with saying,
‘She will soon be married; and then there may be hope.’
