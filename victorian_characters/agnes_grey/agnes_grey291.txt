I made many and various attempts to deliver my pupils from these delusive
notions without alarming their pride—which was easily offended, and not
soon appeased—but with little apparent result; and I know not which was
the more reprehensible of the two: Matilda was more rude and boisterous;
but from Rosalie’s womanly age and lady-like exterior better things were
expected: yet she was as provokingly careless and inconsiderate as a
giddy child of twelve.
