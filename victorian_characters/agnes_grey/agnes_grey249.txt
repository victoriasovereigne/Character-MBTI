‘No, but I really was—at least so mamma said—and Brown and Williamson.
Brown said she was sure no gentleman could set eyes on me without falling
in love that minute; and so I may be allowed to be a little vain. I know
you think me a shocking, conceited, frivolous girl; but then, you know, I
don’t attribute it _all_ to my personal attractions: I give some praise
to the hairdresser, and some to my exquisitely lovely dress—you must see
it to-morrow—white gauze over pink satin—and so _sweetly_ made! and a
necklace and bracelet of beautiful, large pearls!’
