‘He did not strike me as being particularly so; I don’t dislike that cast
of countenance: but the only thing I particularly noticed about him was
his style of reading; which appeared to me good—infinitely better, at
least, than Mr. Hatfield’s. He read the Lessons as if he were bent on
giving full effect to every passage; it seemed as if the most careless
person could not have helped attending, nor the most ignorant have failed
to understand; and the prayers he read as if he were not reading at all,
but praying earnestly and sincerely from his own heart.’
