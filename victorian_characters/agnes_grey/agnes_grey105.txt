I returned, however, with unabated vigour to my work—a more arduous task
than anyone can imagine, who has not felt something like the misery of
being charged with the care and direction of a set of mischievous,
turbulent rebels, whom his utmost exertions cannot bind to their duty;
while, at the same time, he is responsible for their conduct to a higher
power, who exacts from him what cannot be achieved without the aid of the
superior’s more potent authority; which, either from indolence, or the
fear of becoming unpopular with the said rebellious gang, the latter
refuses to give. I can conceive few situations more harassing than that
wherein, however you may long for success, however you may labour to
fulfil your duty, your efforts are baffled and set at nought by those
beneath you, and unjustly censured and misjudged by those above.
