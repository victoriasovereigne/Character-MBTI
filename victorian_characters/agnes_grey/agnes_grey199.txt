Miss Murray, otherwise Rosalie, was about sixteen when I came, and
decidedly a very pretty girl; and in two years longer, as time more
completely developed her form and added grace to her carriage and
deportment, she became positively beautiful; and that in no common
degree. She was tall and slender, yet not thin; perfectly formed,
exquisitely fair, though not without a brilliant, healthy bloom; her
hair, which she wore in a profusion of long ringlets, was of a very light
brown inclining to yellow; her eyes were pale blue, but so clear and
bright that few would wish them darker; the rest of her features were
small, not quite regular, and not remarkably otherwise: but altogether
you could not hesitate to pronounce her a very lovely girl. I wish I
could say as much for mind and disposition as I can for her form and
face.
