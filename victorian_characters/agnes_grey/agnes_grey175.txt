‘No, but still it is very unpleasant to live with such unimpressible,
incomprehensible creatures. You cannot love them; and if you could, your
love would be utterly thrown away: they could neither return it, nor
value, nor understand it. But, however, even if I should stumble on such
a family again, which is quite unlikely, I have all this experience to
begin with, and I should manage better another time; and the end and aim
of this preamble is, let me try again.’
