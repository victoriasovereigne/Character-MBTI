‘Well, I know it’s very wrong;—but never mind! I mean to be good some
time—only don’t preach now, there’s a good creature. I haven’t told you
half yet. Let me see. Oh! I was going to tell you how many
unmistakeable admirers I had:—Sir Thomas Ashby was one,—Sir Hugh Meltham
and Sir Broadley Wilson are old codgers, only fit companions for papa and
mamma. Sir Thomas is young, rich, and gay; but an ugly beast,
nevertheless: however, mamma says I should not mind that after a few
months’ acquaintance. Then, there was Henry Meltham, Sir Hugh’s younger
son; rather good-looking, and a pleasant fellow to flirt with: but
_being_ a younger son, that is all he is good for; then there was young
Mr. Green, rich enough, but of no family, and a great stupid fellow, a
mere country booby! and then, our good rector, Mr. Hatfield: an _humble_
admirer he ought to consider himself; but I fear he has forgotten to
number humility among his stock of Christian virtues.’
