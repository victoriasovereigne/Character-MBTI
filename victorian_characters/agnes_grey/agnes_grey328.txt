‘Yes, many a time; and since my eyes has been so bad, he’s sat an’ read
to me by the half-hour together: but you know, Miss, he has other folks
to see, and other things to do—God bless him! An’ that next Sunday he
preached _such_ a sermon! His text was, “Come unto me all ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,” and them two blessed
verses that follows. You wasn’t there, Miss, you was with your friends
then—but it made me _so_ happy! And I _am_ happy now, thank God! an’ I
take a pleasure, now, in doing little bits o’ jobs for my neighbours—such
as a poor old body ’at’s half blind can do; and they take it kindly of
me, just as he said. You see, Miss, I’m knitting a pair o’ stockings
now;—they’re for Thomas Jackson: he’s a queerish old body, an’ we’ve had
many a bout at threaping, one anent t’other; an’ at times we’ve differed
sorely. So I thought I couldn’t do better nor knit him a pair o’ warm
stockings; an’ I’ve felt to like him a deal better, poor old man, sin’ I
began. It’s turned out just as Maister Weston said.’
