With me, at her age, or under, neglect and disgrace were the most
dreadful of punishments; but on her they made no impression. Sometimes,
exasperated to the utmost pitch, I would shake her violently by the
shoulder, or pull her long hair, or put her in the corner; for which she
punished me with loud, shrill, piercing screams, that went through my
head like a knife. She knew I hated this, and when she had shrieked her
utmost, would look into my face with an air of vindictive satisfaction,
exclaiming,—‘_Now_, then! _that’s_ for you!’ and then shriek again and
again, till I was forced to stop my ears. Often these dreadful cries
would bring Mrs. Bloomfield up to inquire what was the matter?
