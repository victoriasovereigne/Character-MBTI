‘Mercy, how dull you must have been! I really must show you the library;
and you must ring for everything you want, just as you would in an inn,
and make yourself comfortable. I have selfish reasons for wishing to
make you happy, because I want you to stay with me, and not fulfil your
horrid threat of running away in a day or two.’
