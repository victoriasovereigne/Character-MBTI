I left Horton Lodge, and went to join my mother in our new abode at A---.
I found her well in health, resigned in spirit, and even cheerful, though
subdued and sober, in her general demeanour. We had only three boarders
and half a dozen day-pupils to commence with; but by due care and
diligence we hoped ere long to increase the number of both.
