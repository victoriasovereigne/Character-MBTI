‘Oh, they’re jogging on as usual, I suppose: but I know very little about
any of them—except Harry,’ said she, blushing slightly, and smiling
again. ‘I saw a great deal of him while we were in London; for, as soon
as he heard we were there, he came up under pretence of visiting his
brother, and either followed me, like a shadow, wherever I went, or met
me, like a reflection, at every turn. You needn’t look so shocked, Miss
Grey; I was very discreet, I assure you, but, you know, one can’t help
being admired. Poor fellow! He was not my only worshipper; though he
was certainly the most conspicuous, and, I think, the most devoted among
them all. And that detestable—ahem—and Sir Thomas chose to take offence
at him—or my profuse expenditure, or something—I don’t exactly know
what—and hurried me down to the country at a moment’s notice; where I’m
to play the hermit, I suppose, for life.’
