‘After he was gone, Hannah Rogers, one o’ th’ neighbours, came in and
wanted me to help her to wash. I telled her I couldn’t just then, for I
hadn’t set on th’ potaties for th’ dinner, nor washed up th’ breakfast
stuff yet. So then she began a-calling me for my nasty idle ways. I was
a little bit vexed at first, but I never said nothing wrong to her: I
only telled her like all in a quiet way, ’at I’d had th’ new parson to
see me; but I’d get done as quick as ever I could, an’ then come an’ help
her. So then she softened down; and my heart like as it warmed towards
her, an’ in a bit we was very good friends. An’ so it is, Miss Grey, “a
soft answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger.” It
isn’t only in them you speak to, but in yourself.’
