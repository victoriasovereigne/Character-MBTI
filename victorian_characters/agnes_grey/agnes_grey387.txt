The following day was as fine as the preceding one. Soon after breakfast
Miss Matilda, having galloped and blundered through a few unprofitable
lessons, and vengeably thumped the piano for an hour, in a terrible
humour with both me and it, because her mamma would not give her a
holiday, had betaken herself to her favourite places of resort, the
yards, the stables, and the dog-kennels; and Miss Murray was gone forth
to enjoy a quiet ramble with a new fashionable novel for her companion,
leaving me in the schoolroom hard at work upon a water-colour drawing
which I had promised to do for her, and which she insisted upon my
finishing that day.
