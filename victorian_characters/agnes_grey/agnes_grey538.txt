Sunday, however, was approaching: I should see him then: for now that
Miss Murray was gone, I could have my old corner again. I should see
him, and by look, speech, and manner, I might judge whether the
circumstance of her marriage had very much afflicted him. Happily I
could perceive no shadow of a difference: he wore the same aspect as he
had worn two months agoâ€”voice, look, manner, all alike unchanged: there
was the same keen-sighted, unclouded truthfulness in his discourse, the
same forcible clearness in his style, the same earnest simplicity in all
he said and did, that made itself, not marked by the eye and ear, but
felt upon the hearts of his audience.
