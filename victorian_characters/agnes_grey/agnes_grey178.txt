After some further discussion, my mother promised once more to assist me,
provided I would wait and be patient; and I left her to broach the matter
to my father, when and how she deemed it most advisable: never doubting
her ability to obtain his consent. Meantime, I searched, with great
interest, the advertising columns of the newspapers, and wrote answers to
every ‘Wanted a Governess’ that appeared at all eligible; but all my
letters, as well as the replies, when I got any, were dutifully shown to
my mother; and she, to my chagrin, made me reject the situations one
after another: these were low people, these were too exacting in their
demands, and these too niggardly in their remuneration.
