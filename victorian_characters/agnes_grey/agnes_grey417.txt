‘Oh, Miss Grey! do be so kind as to go and see Mark Wood, and take his
wife half-a-crown from me—I should have given or sent it a week ago, but
quite forgot. There!’ said she, throwing me her purse, and speaking very
fast—‘Never mind getting it out now, but take the purse and give them
what you like; I would go with you, but I want to finish this volume.
I’ll come and meet you when I’ve done it. Be quick, will you—and—oh,
wait; hadn’t you better read to him a bit? Run to the house and get some
sort of a good book. Anything will do.’
