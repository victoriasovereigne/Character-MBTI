When we re-entered the house it was nearly tea-time. Master Tom told me
that, as papa was from home, he and I and Mary Ann were to have tea with
mamma, for a treat; for, on such occasions, she always dined at
luncheon-time with them, instead of at six o’clock. Soon after tea, Mary
Ann went to bed, but Tom favoured us with his company and conversation
till eight. After he was gone, Mrs. Bloomfield further enlightened me on
the subject of her children’s dispositions and acquirements, and on what
they were to learn, and how they were to be managed, and cautioned me to
mention their defects to no one but herself. My mother had warned me
before to mention them as little as possible to _her_, for people did not
like to be told of their children’s faults, and so I concluded I was to
keep silence on them altogether. About half-past nine, Mrs. Bloomfield
invited me to partake of a frugal supper of cold meat and bread. I was
glad when that was over, and she took her bedroom candlestick and retired
to rest; for though I wished to be pleased with her, her company was
extremely irksome to me; and I could not help feeling that she was cold,
grave, and forbidding—the very opposite of the kind, warm-hearted matron
my hopes had depicted her to be.
