Through all our troubles, I never but once heard my mother complain of
our want of money. As summer was coming on she observed to Mary and me,
‘What a desirable thing it would be for your papa to spend a few weeks at
a watering-place. I am convinced the sea-air and the change of scene
would be of incalculable service to him. But then, you see, there’s no
money,’ she added, with a sigh. We both wished exceedingly that the
thing might be done, and lamented greatly that it could not. ‘Well,
well!’ said she, ‘it’s no use complaining. Possibly something might be
done to further the project after all. Mary, you are a beautiful drawer.
What do you say to doing a few more pictures in your best style, and
getting them framed, with the water-coloured drawings you have already
done, and trying to dispose of them to some liberal picture-dealer, who
has the sense to discern their merits?’
