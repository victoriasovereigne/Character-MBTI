As a moral agent, Matilda was reckless, headstrong, violent, and
unamenable to reason. One proof of the deplorable state of her mind was,
that from her father’s example she had learned to swear like a trooper.
Her mother was greatly shocked at the ‘unlady-like trick,’ and wondered
‘how she had picked it up.’ ‘But you can soon break her of it, Miss
Grey,’ said she: ‘it is only a habit; and if you will just gently remind
her every time she does so, I am sure she will soon lay it aside.’ I not
only ‘gently reminded’ her, I tried to impress upon her how wrong it was,
and how distressing to the ears of decent people: but all in vain: I was
only answered by a careless laugh, and, ‘Oh, Miss Grey, how shocked you
are! I’m so glad!’ or, ‘Well! I can’t help it; papa shouldn’t have
taught me: I learned it all from him; and maybe a bit from the coachman.’
