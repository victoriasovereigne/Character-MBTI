I have omitted to give a detail of his words, from a notion that they
would not interest the reader as they did me, and not because I have
forgotten them. No; I remember them well; for I thought them over and
over again in the course of that day and many succeeding ones, I know not
how often; and recalled every intonation of his deep, clear voice, every
flash of his quick, brown eye, and every gleam of his pleasant, but too
transient smile. Such a confession will look very absurd, I fear: but no
matter: I have written it: and they that read it will not know the
writer.
