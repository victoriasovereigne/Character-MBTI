Mr. Weston was now gone, and we too went on our way; but as we returned,
after having deposited the hare in a farm-house, and demolished some
spice-cake and currant-wine in exchange, we met him returning also from
the execution of his mission, whatever it might be. He carried in his
hand a cluster of beautiful bluebells, which he offered to me; observing,
with a smile, that though he had seen so little of me for the last two
months, he had not forgotten that bluebells were numbered among my
favourite flowers. It was done as a simple act of goodwill, without
compliment or remarkable courtesy, or any look that could be construed
into ‘reverential, tender adoration’ (_vide_ Rosalie Murray); but still,
it was something to find my unimportant saying so well remembered: it was
something that he had noticed so accurately the time I had ceased to be
visible.
