‘Oh, _such_ news! In the first place, you must know that Mr. Hatfield
came upon me just after you were gone. I was in such a way for fear papa
or mamma should see him; but you know I couldn’t call you back again, and
so!—oh, dear! I can’t tell you all about it now, for there’s Matilda, I
see, in the park, and I must go and open my budget to her. But, however,
Hatfield was most uncommonly audacious, unspeakably complimentary, and
unprecedentedly tender—tried to be so, at least—he didn’t succeed very
well in _that_, because it’s not his vein. I’ll tell you all he said
another time.’
