The wedding was fixed for the first of June. Between that and the
critical ball was little more than six weeks; but, with Rosalie’s
accomplished skill and resolute exertion, much might be done, even within
that period; especially as Sir Thomas spent most of the interim in
London; whither he went up, it was said, to settle affairs with his
lawyer, and make other preparations for the approaching nuptials. He
endeavoured to supply the want of his presence by a pretty constant fire
of billets-doux; but these did not attract the neighbours’ attention, and
open their eyes, as personal visits would have done; and old Lady Ashby’s
haughty, sour spirit of reserve withheld her from spreading the news,
while her indifferent health prevented her coming to visit her future
daughter-in-law; so that, altogether, this affair was kept far closer
than such things usually are.
