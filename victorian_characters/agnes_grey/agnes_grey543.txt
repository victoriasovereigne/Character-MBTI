‘Well! that is a strange confession, _however_, to come from her
_governess_! Who is to form a young lady’s tastes, I wonder, if the
governess doesn’t do it? I have known governesses who have so completely
identified themselves with the reputation of their young ladies for
elegance and propriety in mind and manners, that they would blush to
speak a word against them; and to hear the slightest blame imputed to
their pupils was worse than to be censured in their own persons—and I
really think it very natural, for my part.’
