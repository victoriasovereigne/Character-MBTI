‘But there’s one remedy for all, my dear, and that’s resignation’ (a toss
of the head), ‘resignation to the will of heaven!’ (an uplifting of the
hands and eyes). ‘It has always supported me through all my trials, and
always will do’ (a succession of nods). ‘But then, it isn’t everybody
that can say that’ (a shake of the head); ‘but I’m one of the pious ones,
Miss Grey!’ (a very significant nod and toss). ‘And, thank heaven, I
always was’ (another nod), ‘and I glory in it!’ (an emphatic clasping of
the hands and shaking of the head). And with several texts of Scripture,
misquoted or misapplied, and religious exclamations so redolent of the
ludicrous in the style of delivery and manner of bringing in, if not in
the expressions themselves, that I decline repeating them, she withdrew;
tossing her large head in high good-humour—with herself at least—and left
me hoping that, after all, she was rather weak than wicked.
