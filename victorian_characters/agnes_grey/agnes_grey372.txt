‘Oh, yes, you could,’ said he, with a thoughtful smile. ‘The ties that
bind us to life are tougher than you imagine, or than anyone can who has
not felt how roughly they may be pulled without breaking. You might be
miserable without a home, but even _you_ could live; and not so miserably
as you suppose. The human heart is like india-rubber; a little swells
it, but a great deal will not burst it. If “little more than nothing
will disturb it, little less than all things will suffice” to break it.
As in the outer members of our frame, there is a vital power inherent in
itself that strengthens it against external violence. Every blow that
shakes it will serve to harden it against a future stroke; as constant
labour thickens the skin of the hand, and strengthens its muscles instead
of wasting them away: so that a day of arduous toil, that might excoriate
a lady’s palm, would make no sensible impression on that of a hardy
ploughman.
