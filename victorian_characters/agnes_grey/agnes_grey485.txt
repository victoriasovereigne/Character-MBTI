Sometimes, such thoughts would give me trouble enough; but sometimes I
could quiet them with thinking—it is not the man, it is his goodness that
I love. ‘Whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
whatsoever things are honest and of good report, think on these things.’
We do well to worship God in His works; and I know none of them in which
so many of His attributes—so much of His own spirit shines, as in this
His faithful servant; whom to know and not to appreciate, were obtuse
insensibility in me, who have so little else to occupy my heart.
