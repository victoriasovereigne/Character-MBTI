At my feet lay a little rough terrier. It was the property of Miss
Matilda; but she hated the animal, and intended to sell it, alleging that
it was quite spoiled. It was really an excellent dog of its kind; but
she affirmed it was fit for nothing, and had not even the sense to know
its own mistress.
