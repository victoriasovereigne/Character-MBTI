About Christmas I was allowed to visit home; but my holiday was only of a
fortnight’s duration: ‘For,’ said Mrs. Bloomfield, ‘I thought, as you had
seen your friends so lately, you would not care for a longer stay.’ I
left her to think so still: but she little knew how long, how wearisome
those fourteen weeks of absence had been to me; how intensely I had
longed for my holidays, how greatly I was disappointed at their
curtailment. Yet she was not to blame in this. I had never told her my
feelings, and she could not be expected to divine them; I had not been
with her a full term, and she was justified in not allowing me a full
vacation.
