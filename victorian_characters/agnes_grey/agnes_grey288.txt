As I had now only one regular pupil—though she contrived to give me as
much trouble as three or four ordinary ones, and though her sister still
took lessons in German and drawing—I had considerably more time at my own
disposal than I had ever been blessed with before, since I had taken upon
me the governess’s yoke; which time I devoted partly to correspondence
with my friends, partly to reading, study, and the practice of music,
singing, &c., partly to wandering in the grounds or adjacent fields, with
my pupils if they wanted me, alone if they did not.
