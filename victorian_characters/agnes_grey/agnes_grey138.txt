Though not a positive drunkard, Mr. Robson habitually swallowed great
quantities of wine, and took with relish an occasional glass of brandy
and water. He taught his nephew to imitate him in this to the utmost of
his ability, and to believe that the more wine and spirits he could take,
and the better he liked them, the more he manifested his bold, and manly
spirit, and rose superior to his sisters. Mr. Bloomfield had not much to
say against it, for his favourite beverage was gin and water; of which he
took a considerable portion every day, by dint of constant sippingâ€”and to
that I chiefly attributed his dingy complexion and waspish temper.
