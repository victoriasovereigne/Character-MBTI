At her next visit to Wellwood House, I went so far as to say I was glad
to see her looking so well. The effect of this was magical: the words,
intended as a mark of civility, were received as a flattering compliment;
her countenance brightened up, and from that moment she became as
gracious and benign as heart could wishâ€”in outward semblance at least.
From what I now saw of her, and what I heard from the children, I know
that, in order to gain her cordial friendship, I had but to utter a word
of flattery at each convenient opportunity: but this was against my
principles; and for lack of this, the capricious old dame soon deprived
me of her favour again, and I believe did me much secret injury.
