‘No, Mary,’ said she, ‘if Richardson and you have anything to spare, you
must lay it aside for your family; and Agnes and I must gather honey for
ourselves. Thanks to my having had daughters to educate, I have not
forgotten my accomplishments. God willing, I will check this vain
repining,’ she said, while the tears coursed one another down her cheeks
in spite of her efforts; but she wiped them away, and resolutely shaking
back her head, continued, ‘I will exert myself, and look out for a small
house, commodiously situated in some populous but healthy district, where
we will take a few young ladies to board and educate—if we can get
them—and as many day pupils as will come, or as we can manage to
instruct. Your father’s relations and old friends will be able to send
us some pupils, or to assist us with their recommendations, no doubt: I
shall not apply to my own. What say you to it, Agnes? will you be
willing to leave your present situation and try?’
