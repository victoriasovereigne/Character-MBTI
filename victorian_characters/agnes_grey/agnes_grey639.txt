‘If I didn’t sit with her in the drawing-room while Sir Thomas is taking
his wine,’ said she, ‘she would never forgive me; and then, if I leave
the room the instant he comes—as I have done once or twice—it is an
unpardonable offence against her dear Thomas. _She_ never showed such
disrespect to _her_ husband: and as for affection, wives never think of
that now-a-days, she supposes: but things were different in _her_ time—as
if there was any good to be done by staying in the room, when he does
nothing but grumble and scold when he’s in a bad humour, talk disgusting
nonsense when he’s in a good one, and go to sleep on the sofa when he’s
too stupid for either; which is most frequently the case now, when he has
nothing to do but to sot over his wine.’
