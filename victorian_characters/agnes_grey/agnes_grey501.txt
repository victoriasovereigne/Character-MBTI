I remembered that eleven was the hour at which Mr. Weston proposed to
come to the porterâ€™s lodge; and remembering that, I beheld the whole
contrivance. Accordingly, at dinner, I was entertained with a long
account of how Mr. Weston had overtaken them as they were walking along
the road; and how they had had a long walk and talk with him, and really
found him quite an agreeable companion; and how he must have been, and
evidently was, delighted with them and their amazing condescension, &c.
&c.
