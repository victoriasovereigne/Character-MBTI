‘I settled everything with Mrs. Grey, while you were putting on your
bonnet,’ replied he. ‘She said I might have her consent, if I could
obtain yours; and I asked her, in case I should be so happy, to come and
live with us—for I was sure you would like it better. But she refused,
saying she could now afford to employ an assistant, and would continue
the school till she could purchase an annuity sufficient to maintain her
in comfortable lodgings; and, meantime, she would spend her vacations
alternately with us and your sister, and should be quite contented if you
were happy. And so now I have overruled your objections on her account.
Have you any other?’
