But this time I was not long alone. It struck me, first, as very odd,
that just as I was thinking about Mr. Weston he should come up and accost
me; but afterwards, on due reflection, I thought there was nothing odd
about it, unless it were the fact of his speaking to me; for on such a
morning and so near his own abode, it was natural enough that he should
be about; and as for my thinking of him, I had been doing that, with
little intermission, ever since we set out on our journey; so there was
nothing remarkable in that.
