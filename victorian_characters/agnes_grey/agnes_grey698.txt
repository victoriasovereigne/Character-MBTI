‘Mr. Hatfield was the rector, and Mr. Weston the curate: I used to
mention him sometimes in contradistinction to Mr. Hatfield, as being a
more efficient clergyman. However, he was on the sands this morning with
the dog—he had bought it, I suppose, from the rat-catcher; and he knew me
as well as it did—probably through its means: and I had a little
conversation with him, in the course of which, as he asked about our
school, I was led to say something about you, and your good management;
and he said he should like to know you, and asked if I would introduce
him to you, if he should take the liberty of calling to-morrow; so I said
I would. Was I right?’
