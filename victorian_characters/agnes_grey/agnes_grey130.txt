After this, Mr. Bloomfield was continually looking in to see if the
schoolroom was in order; and, as the children were continually littering
the floor with fragments of toys, sticks, stones, stubble, leaves, and
other rubbish, which I could not prevent their bringing, or oblige them
to gather up, and which the servants refused to ‘clean after them,’ I had
to spend a considerable portion of my valuable leisure moments on my
knees upon the floor, in painsfully reducing things to order. Once I
told them that they should not taste their supper till they had picked up
everything from the carpet; Fanny might have hers when she had taken up a
certain quantity, Mary Ann when she had gathered twice as many, and Tom
was to clear away the rest. Wonderful to state, the girls did their
part; but Tom was in such a fury that he flew upon the table, scattered
the bread and milk about the floor, struck his sisters, kicked the coals
out of the coal-pan, attempted to overthrow the table and chairs, and
seemed inclined to make a Douglas-larder of the whole contents of the
room: but I seized upon him, and, sending Mary Ann to call her mamma,
held him, in spite of kicks, blows, yells, and execrations, till Mrs.
Bloomfield made her appearance.
