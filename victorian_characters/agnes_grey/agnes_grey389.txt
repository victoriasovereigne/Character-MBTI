The fact was she had purchased it when but a small puppy, insisting at
first that no one should touch it but herself; but soon becoming tired of
so helpless and troublesome a nursling, she had gladly yielded to my
entreaties to be allowed to take charge of it; and I, by carefully
nursing the little creature from infancy to adolescence, of course, had
obtained its affections: a reward I should have greatly valued, and
looked upon as far outweighing all the trouble I had had with it, had not
poor Snap’s grateful feelings exposed him to many a harsh word and many a
spiteful kick and pinch from his owner, and were he not now in danger of
being ‘put away’ in consequence, or transferred to some rough,
stony-hearted master. But how could I help it? I could not make the dog
hate me by cruel treatment, and she would not propitiate him by kindness.
