But Mr. Robson and old Mrs. Bloomfield were not the only guests whose
coming to Wellwood House annoyed me; every visitor disturbed me more or
less; not so much because they neglected me (though I did feel their
conduct strange and disagreeable in that respect), as because I found it
impossible to keep my pupils away from them, as I was repeatedly desired
to do: Tom must talk to them, and Mary Ann must be noticed by them.
Neither the one nor the other knew what it was to feel any degree of
shamefacedness, or even common modesty. They would indecently and
clamorously interrupt the conversation of their elders, tease them with
the most impertinent questions, roughly collar the gentlemen, climb their
knees uninvited, hang about their shoulders or rifle their pockets, pull
the ladiesâ€™ gowns, disorder their hair, tumble their collars, and
importunately beg for their trinkets.
