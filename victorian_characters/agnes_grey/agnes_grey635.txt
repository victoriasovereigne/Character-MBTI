‘No;—my mother-in-law—and my unfortunate mistake! Instead of letting her
take herself off to some other house, as she offered to do when I
married, I was fool enough to ask her to live here still, and direct the
affairs of the house for me; because, in the first place, I hoped we
should spend the greater part of the year, in town, and in the second
place, being so young and inexperienced, I was frightened at the idea of
having a houseful of servants to manage, and dinners to order, and
parties to entertain, and all the rest of it, and I thought she might
assist me with her experience; never dreaming she would prove a usurper,
a tyrant, an incubus, a spy, and everything else that’s detestable. I
wish she was dead!’
