Fanny and little Harriet he seldom condescended to notice; but Mary Ann
was something of a favourite. He was continually encouraging her
tendency to affectation (which I had done my utmost to crush), talking
about her pretty face, and filling her head with all manner of conceited
notions concerning her personal appearance (which I had instructed her to
regard as dust in the balance compared with the cultivation of her mind
and manners); and I never saw a child so susceptible of flattery as she
was. Whatever was wrong, in either her or her brother, he would
encourage by laughing at, if not by actually praising: people little know
the injury they do to children by laughing at their faults, and making a
pleasant jest of what their true friends have endeavoured to teach them
to hold in grave abhorrence.
