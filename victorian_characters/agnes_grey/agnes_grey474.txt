But Jane and Susan Green soon reached their home. As they stood
parleying at the park-gates, attempting to persuade Miss Murray to come
in, I wished Mr. Weston would go, that she might not see him with me when
she turned round; but, unfortunately, his business, which was to pay one
more visit to poor Mark Wood, led him to pursue the same path as we did,
till nearly the close of our journey. When, however, he saw that Rosalie
had taken leave of her friends and I was about to join her, he would have
left me and passed on at a quicker pace; but, as he civilly lifted his
hat in passing her, to my surprise, instead of returning the salute with
a stiff, ungracious bow, she accosted him with one of her sweetest
smiles, and, walking by his side, began to talk to him with all
imaginable cheerfulness and affability; and so we proceeded all three
together.
