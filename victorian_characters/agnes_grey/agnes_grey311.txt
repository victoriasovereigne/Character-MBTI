‘Well, my rheumatiz got better—I know not whether wi’ going to church or
not, but one frosty Sunday I got this cold i’ my eyes. Th’ inflammation
didn’t come on all at once like, but bit by bit—but I wasn’t going to
tell you about my eyes, I was talking about my trouble o’ mind;—and to
tell the truth, Miss Grey, I don’t think it was anyways eased by coming
to church—nought to speak on, at least: I like got my health better; but
that didn’t mend my soul. I hearkened and hearkened the ministers, and
read an’ read at my prayer-book; but it was all like sounding brass and a
tinkling cymbal: the sermons I couldn’t understand, an’ th’ prayer-book
only served to show me how wicked I was, that I could read such good
words an’ never be no better for it, and oftens feel it a sore labour an’
a heavy task beside, instead of a blessing and a privilege as all good
Christians does. It seemed like as all were barren an’ dark to me. And
then, them dreadful words, “Many shall seek to enter in, and shall not be
able.” They like as they fair dried up my sperrit.
