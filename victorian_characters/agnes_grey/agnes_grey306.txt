‘But then, you know, Miss Grey, it wasn’t so. However, I telled him I’d
try. “But please, sir,” says I, “if I do go to church, what the better
shall I be? I want to have my sins blotted out, and to feel that they
are remembered no more against me, and that the love of God is shed
abroad in my heart; and if I can get no good by reading my Bible an’
saying my prayers at home, what good shall I get by going to church?”’
