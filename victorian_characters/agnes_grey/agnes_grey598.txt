And now, the last Sunday was come, and the last service. I was often on
the point of melting into tears during the sermon—the last I was to hear
from him: the best I should hear from anyone, I was well assured. It was
over—the congregation were departing; and I must follow. I had then seen
him, and heard his voice, too, probably for the last time. In the
churchyard, Matilda was pounced upon by the two Misses Green. They had
many inquiries to make about her sister, and I know not what besides. I
only wished they would have done, that we might hasten back to Horton
Lodge: I longed to seek the retirement of my own room, or some
sequestered nook in the grounds, that I might deliver myself up to my
feelings—to weep my last farewell, and lament my false hopes and vain
delusions. Only this once, and then adieu to fruitless
dreaming—thenceforth, only sober, solid, sad reality should occupy my
mind. But while I thus resolved, a low voice close beside me said—‘I
suppose you are going this week, Miss Grey?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied. I was
very much startled; and had I been at all hysterically inclined, I
certainly should have committed myself in some way then. Thank God, I
was not.
