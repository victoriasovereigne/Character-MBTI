‘He does, Miss; and I’se thankful for it. He comes to see all us poor
bodies a deal ofter nor Maister Bligh, or th’ Rector ever did; an’ it’s
well he does, for he’s always welcome: we can’t say as much for th’
Rector—there is ‘at says they’re fair feared on him. When he comes into
a house, they say he’s sure to find summut wrong, and begin a-calling ’em
as soon as he crosses th’ doorstuns: but maybe he thinks it his duty like
to tell ’em what’s wrong. And very oft he comes o’ purpose to reprove
folk for not coming to church, or not kneeling an’ standing when other
folk does, or going to the Methody chapel, or summut o’ that sort: but I
can’t say ’at he ever fund much fault wi’ me. He came to see me once or
twice, afore Maister Weston come, when I was so ill troubled in my mind;
and as I had only very poor health besides, I made bold to send for
him—and he came right enough. I was sore distressed, Miss Grey—thank
God, it’s owered now—but when I took my Bible, I could get no comfort of
it at all. That very chapter ‘at you’ve just been reading troubled me as
much as aught—“He that loveth not, knoweth not God.” It seemed fearsome
to me; for I felt that I loved neither God nor man as I should do, and
could not, if I tried ever so. And th’ chapter afore, where it says,—“He
that is born of God cannot commit sin.” And another place where it
says,—“Love is the fulfilling of the Law.” And many, many others, Miss:
I should fair weary you out, if I was to tell them all. But all seemed
to condemn me, and to show me ‘at I was not in the right way; and as I
knew not how to get into it, I sent our Bill to beg Maister Hatfield to
be as kind as look in on me some day and when he came, I telled him all
my troubles.’
