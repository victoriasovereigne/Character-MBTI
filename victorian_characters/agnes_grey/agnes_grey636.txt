She then turned to give her orders to the footman, who had been standing
bolt upright within the door for the last half minute, and had heard the
latter part of her animadversions; and, of course, made his own
reflections upon them, notwithstanding the inflexible, wooden countenance
he thought proper to preserve in the drawing-room. On my remarking
afterwards that he must have heard her, she replied—‘Oh, no matter! I
never care about the footmen; they’re mere automatons: it’s nothing to
them what their superiors say or do; they won’t dare to repeat it; and as
to what they think—if they presume to think at all—of course, nobody
cares for that. It would be a pretty thing indeed, it we were to be
tongue-tied by our servants!’
