continuance here; for small as the salary was, I still was earning

that, I did not even regret the step I had taken. I longed to show my
friends that, even now, I was competent to undertake the charge, and able
to acquit myself honourably to the end; and if ever I felt it degrading
to submit so quietly, or intolerable to toil so constantly, I would turn
towards my home, and say within myselfâ€”
