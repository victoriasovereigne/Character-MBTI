Almost immediately after the conclusion of the service, Miss Murray left
the church. We had to stand in the porch, for it was raining, and the
carriage was not yet come. I wondered at her coming forth so hastily,
for neither young Meltham nor Squire Green was there; but I soon found it
was to secure an interview with Mr. Weston as he came out, which he
presently did. Having saluted us both, he would have passed on, but she
detained him; first with observations upon the disagreeable weather, and
then with asking if he would be so kind as to come some time to-morrow to
see the granddaughter of the old woman who kept the porterâ€™s lodge, for
the girl was ill of a fever, and wished to see him. He promised to do
so.
