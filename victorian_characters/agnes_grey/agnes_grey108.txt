Sometimes, on such occasions, the thought has suddenly occurred to me—‘If
they could see me now!’ meaning, of course, my friends at home; and the
idea of how they would pity me has made me pity myself—so greatly that I
have had the utmost difficulty to restrain my tears: but I have
restrained them, till my little tormentors were gone to dessert, or
cleared off to bed (my only prospects of deliverance), and then, in all
the bliss of solitude, I have given myself up to the luxury of an
unrestricted burst of weeping. But this was a weakness I did not often
indulge: my employments were too numerous, my leisure moments too
precious, to admit of much time being given to fruitless lamentations.
