During the remainder of that day of festal sadness, I was left to my own
devices. Being too much unhinged for any steady occupation, I wandered
about with a book in my hand for several hours, more thinking than
reading, for I had many things to think about. In the evening, I made
use of my liberty to go and see my old friend Nancy once again; to
apologize for my long absence (which must have seemed so neglectful and
unkind) by telling her how busy I had been; and to talk, or read, or work
for her, whichever might be most acceptable, and also, of course, to tell
her the news of this important day: and perhaps to obtain a little
information from her in return, respecting Mr. Weston’s expected
departure. But of this she seemed to know nothing, and I hoped, as she
did, that it was all a false report. She was very glad to see me; but,
happily, her eyes were now so nearly well that she was almost independent
of my services. She was deeply interested in the wedding; but while I
amused her with the details of the festive day, the splendours of the
bridal party and of the bride herself, she often sighed and shook her
head, and wished good might come of it; she seemed, like me, to regard it
rather as a theme for sorrow than rejoicing. I sat a long time talking
to her about that and other things—but no one came.
