‘Oh, nonsense!’ cried the young lady, shaking herself with vexation.
‘You either can’t understand me, or you won’t. If I had not confidence
in your magnanimity, I should think you envied me. But you will,
perhaps, comprehend this cause of pleasure—which is as great as
any—namely, that I am delighted with myself for my prudence, my
self-command, my heartlessness, if you please. I was not a bit taken by
surprise, not a bit confused, or awkward, or foolish; I just acted and
spoke as I ought to have done, and was completely my own mistress
throughout. And here was a man, decidedly good-looking—Jane and Susan
Green call him bewitchingly handsome--I suppose they’re two of the ladies
he pretends would be so glad to have him; but, however, he was certainly
a very clever, witty, agreeable companion—not what you call clever, but
just enough to make him entertaining; and a man one needn’t be ashamed of
anywhere, and would not soon grow tired of; and to confess the truth, I
rather liked him—better even, of late, than Harry Meltham—and he
evidently idolised me; and yet, though he came upon me all alone and
unprepared, I had the wisdom, and the pride, and the strength to refuse
him—and so scornfully and coolly as I did: I have good reason to be proud
of that.’
