He next took me across the lawn to see his mole-traps, and then into the
stack-yard to see his weasel-traps: one of which, to his great joy,
contained a dead weasel; and then into the stable to see, not the fine
carriage-horses, but a little rough colt, which he informed me had been
bred on purpose for him, and he was to ride it as soon as it was properly
trained. I tried to amuse the little fellow, and listened to all his
chatter as complacently as I could; for I thought if he had any
affections at all, I would endeavour to win them; and then, in time, I
might be able to show him the error of his ways: but I looked in vain for
that generous, noble spirit his mother talked of; though I could see he
was not without a certain degree of quickness and penetration, when he
chose to exert it.
