The garden was a large one, and tastefully laid out; besides several
splendid dahlias, there were some other fine flowers still in bloom: but
my companion would not give me time to examine them: I must go with him,
across the wet grass, to a remote sequestered corner, the most important
place in the grounds, because it contained _his_ garden. There were two
round beds, stocked with a variety of plants. In one there was a pretty
little rose-tree. I paused to admire its lovely blossoms.
