She could not greatly influence her daughter-in-law against me, because,
between that lady and herself there was a mutual dislikeâ€”chiefly shown by
her in secret detractions and calumniations; by the other, in an excess
of frigid formality in her demeanour; and no fawning flattery of the
elder could thaw away the wall of ice which the younger interposed
between them. But with her son, the old lady had better success: he
would listen to all she had to say, provided she could soothe his fretful
temper, and refrain from irritating him by her own asperities; and I have
reason to believe that she considerably strengthened his prejudice
against me. She would tell him that I shamefully neglected the children,
and even his wife did not attend to them as she ought; and that he must
look after them himself, or they would all go to ruin.
