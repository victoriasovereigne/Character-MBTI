‘Yes,’ answered I; internally adding, ‘and I thought it somewhat
derogatory to his dignity as a clergyman to come flying from the pulpit
in such eager haste to shake hands with the squire, and hand his wife and
daughters into their carriage: and, moreover, I owe him a grudge for
nearly shutting me out of it’; for, in fact, though I was standing before
his face, close beside the carriage steps, waiting to get in, he would
persist in putting them up and closing the door, till one of the family
stopped him by calling out that the governess was not in yet; then,
without a word of apology, he departed, wishing them good-morning, and
leaving the footman to finish the business.
