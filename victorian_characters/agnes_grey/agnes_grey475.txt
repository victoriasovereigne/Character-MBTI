After a short pause in the conversation, Mr. Weston made some remark
addressed particularly to me, as referring to something we had been
talking of before; but before I could answer, Miss Murray replied to the
observation and enlarged upon it: he rejoined; and, from thence to the
close of the interview, she engrossed him entirely to herself. It might
be partly owing to my own stupidity, my want of tact and assurance: but I
felt myself wronged: I trembled with apprehension; and I listened with
envy to her easy, rapid flow of utterance, and saw with anxiety the
bright smile with which she looked into his face from time to time: for
she was walking a little in advance, for the purpose (as I judged) of
being seen as well as heard. If her conversation was light and trivial,
it was amusing, and she was never at a loss for something to say, or for
suitable words to express it in. There was nothing pert or flippant in
her manner now, as when she walked with Mr. Hatfield, there was only a
gentle, playful kind of vivacity, which I thought must be peculiarly
pleasing to a man of Mr. Westonâ€™s disposition and temperament.
