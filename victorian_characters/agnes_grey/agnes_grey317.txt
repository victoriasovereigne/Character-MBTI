‘But next day, afore I’d gotten fettled up—for indeed, Miss, I’d no heart
to sweeping an’ fettling, an’ washing pots; so I sat me down i’ th’
muck—who should come in but Maister Weston! I started siding stuff then,
an’ sweeping an’ doing; and I expected he’d begin a-calling me for my
idle ways, as Maister Hatfield would a’ done; but I was mista’en: he only
bid me good-mornin’ like, in a quiet dacent way. So I dusted him a
chair, an’ fettled up th’ fireplace a bit; but I hadn’t forgotten th’
Rector’s words, so says I, “I wonder, sir, you should give yourself that
trouble, to come so far to see a ‘canting old fool,’ such as me.”
