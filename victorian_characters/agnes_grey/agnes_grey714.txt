Here I pause. My Diary, from which I have compiled these pages, goes but
little further. I could go on for years, but I will content myself with
adding, that I shall never forget that glorious summer evening, and
always remember with delight that steep hill, and the edge of the
precipice where we stood together, watching the splendid sunset mirrored
in the restless world of waters at our feet—with hearts filled with
gratitude to heaven, and happiness, and love—almost too full for speech.
