But soon my trials in this quarter came to a close—sooner than I either
expected or desired; for one sweet evening towards the close of May, as I
was rejoicing in the near approach of the holidays, and congratulating
myself upon having made some progress with my pupils (as far as their
learning went, at least, for I _had_ instilled _something_ into their
heads, and I had, at length, brought them to be a little—a very
little—more rational about getting their lessons done in time to leave
some space for recreation, instead of tormenting themselves and me all
day long to no purpose), Mrs. Bloomfield sent for me, and calmly told me
that after Midsummer my services would be no longer required. She
assured me that my character and general conduct were unexceptionable;
but the children had made so little improvement since my arrival that Mr.
Bloomfield and she felt it their duty to seek some other mode of
instruction. Though superior to most children of their years in
abilities, they were decidedly behind them in attainments; their manners
were uncultivated, and their tempers unruly. And this she attributed to
a want of sufficient firmness, and diligent, persevering care on my part.
