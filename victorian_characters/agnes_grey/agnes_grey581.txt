We often pity the poor, because they have no leisure to mourn their
departed relatives, and necessity obliges them to labour through their
severest afflictions: but is not active employment the best remedy for
overwhelming sorrow—the surest antidote for despair? It may be a rough
comforter: it may seem hard to be harassed with the cares of life when we
have no relish for its enjoyments; to be goaded to labour when the heart
is ready to break, and the vexed spirit implores for rest only to weep in
silence: but is not labour better than the rest we covet? and are not
those petty, tormenting cares less hurtful than a continual brooding over
the great affliction that oppresses us? Besides, we cannot have cares,
and anxieties, and toil, without hope—if it be but the hope of fulfilling
our joyless task, accomplishing some needful project, or escaping some
further annoyance. At any rate, I was glad my mother had so much
employment for every faculty of her action-loving frame. Our kind
neighbours lamented that she, once so exalted in wealth and station,
should be reduced to such extremity in her time of sorrow; but I am
persuaded that she would have suffered thrice as much had she been left
in affluence, with liberty to remain in that house, the scene of her
early happiness and late affliction, and no stern necessity to prevent
her from incessantly brooding over and lamenting her bereavement.
