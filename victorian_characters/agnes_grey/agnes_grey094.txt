In vain I expressed my sorrow; in vain I lingered for some symptom of
contrition; she really ‘didn’t care,’ and I left her alone, and in
darkness, wondering most of all at this last proof of insensate
stubbornness. In _my_ childhood I could not imagine a more afflictive
punishment than for my mother to refuse to kiss me at night: the very
idea was terrible. More than the idea I never felt, for, happily, I
never committed a fault that was deemed worthy of such penalty; but once
I remember, for some transgression of my sister’s, our mother thought
proper to inflict it upon her: what _she_ felt, I cannot tell; but my
sympathetic tears and suffering for her sake I shall not soon forget.
