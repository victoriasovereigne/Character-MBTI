She certainly looked very charming as she strolled, lingering along under
the budding horse-chestnut trees that stretched their long arms over the
park-palings; with her closed book in one hand, and in the other a
graceful sprig of myrtle, which served her as a very pretty plaything;
her bright ringlets escaping profusely from her little bonnet, and gently
stirred by the breeze, her fair cheek flushed with gratified vanity, her
smiling blue eyes, now slyly glancing towards her admirer, now gazing
downward at her myrtle sprig. But Snap, running before me, interrupted
her in the midst of some half-pert, half-playful repartee, by catching
hold of her dress and vehemently tugging thereat; till Mr. Hatfield, with
his cane, administered a resounding thwack upon the animal’s skull, and
sent it yelping back to me with a clamorous outcry that afforded the
reverend gentleman great amusement: but seeing me so near, he thought, I
suppose, he might as well be taking his departure; and, as I stooped to
caress the dog, with ostentatious pity to show my disapproval of his
severity, I heard him say: ‘When shall I see you again, Miss Murray?’
