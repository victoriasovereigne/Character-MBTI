The advertisement was quickly written and despatched. Of the two parties
who answered it, but one would consent to give me fifty pounds, the sum
my mother bade me name as the salary I should require; and here, I
hesitated about engaging myself, as I feared the children would be too
old, and their parents would require some one more showy, or more
experienced, if not more accomplished than I. But my mother dissuaded me
from declining it on that account: I should do vastly well, she said, if
I would only throw aside my diffidence, and acquire a little more
confidence in myself. I was just to give a plain, true statement of my
acquirements and qualifications, and name what stipulations I chose to
make, and then await the result. The only stipulation I ventured to
propose, was that I might be allowed two monthsâ€™ holidays during the year
to visit my friends, at Midsummer and Christmas. The unknown lady, in
her reply, made no objection to this, and stated that, as to my
acquirements, she had no doubt I should be able to give satisfaction; but
in the engagement of governesses she considered those things as but
subordinate points; as being situated in the neighbourhood of O---, she
could get masters to supply any deficiencies in that respect: but, in her
opinion, next to unimpeachable morality, a mild and cheerful temper and
obliging disposition were the most essential requisities.
