At eighteen, Miss Murray was to emerge from the quiet obscurity of the
schoolroom into the full blaze of the fashionable world—as much of it, at
least, as could be had out of London; for her papa could not be persuaded
to leave his rural pleasures and pursuits, even for a few weeks’
residence in town. She was to make her début on the third of January, at
a magnificent ball, which her mamma proposed to give to all the nobility
and choice gentry of O--- and its neighbourhood for twenty miles round.
Of course, she looked forward to it with the wildest impatience, and the
most extravagant anticipations of delight.
