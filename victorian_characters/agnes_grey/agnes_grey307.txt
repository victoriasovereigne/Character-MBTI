‘“The church,” says he, “is the place appointed by God for His worship.
It’s your duty to go there as often as you can. If you want comfort, you
must seek it in the path of duty,”—an’ a deal more he said, but I cannot
remember all his fine words. However, it all came to this, that I was to
come to church as oft as ever I could, and bring my prayer-book with me,
an’ read up all the sponsers after the clerk, an’ stand, an’ kneel, an’
sit, an’ do all as I should, and take the Lord’s Supper at every
opportunity, an’ hearken his sermons, and Maister Bligh’s, an’ it ’ud be
all right: if I went on doing my duty, I should get a blessing at last.
