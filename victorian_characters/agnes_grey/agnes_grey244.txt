Rosalie remonstrated, and I thought I should have been torn in pieces
between them; but Miss Matilda having the loudest voice, her sister at
length gave in, and suffered her to tell her story first: so I was doomed
to hear a long account of her splendid mare, its breeding and pedigree,
its paces, its action, its spirit, &c., and of her own amazing skill and
courage in riding it; concluding with an assertion that she could clear a
five-barred gate ‘like winking,’ that papa said she might hunt the next
time the hounds met, and mamma had ordered a bright scarlet hunting-habit
for her.
