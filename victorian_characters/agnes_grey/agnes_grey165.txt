‘Why, nobody shall that isn’t thankful for them. Wasn’t I penniless when
you took me? and you _pretended_, at least, to be vastly pleased with
your acquisition. But it’s no matter whether they get married or not: we
can devise a thousand honest ways of making a livelihood. And I wonder,
Richard, you can think of bothering your head about our _poverty_ in case
of your death; as if _that_ would be anything compared with the calamity
of losing you—an affliction that you well know would swallow up all
others, and which you ought to do your utmost to preserve us from: and
there is nothing like a cheerful mind for keeping the body in health.’
