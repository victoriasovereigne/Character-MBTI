‘And so you think I would lay myself out for his amusement! No: that’s
not _my_ idea of a wife. It’s the husband’s part to please the wife, not
hers to please him; and if he isn’t satisfied with her as she is—and
thankful to possess her too—he isn’t worthy of her, that’s all. And as

reform. But I’m sorry I left you so long alone, Miss Grey. How have you
passed the time?’
