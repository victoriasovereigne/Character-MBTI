Though riches had charms, poverty had no terrors for an inexperienced
girl like me. Indeed, to say the truth, there was something exhilarating
in the idea of being driven to straits, and thrown upon our own
resources. I only wished papa, mamma, and Mary were all of the same mind
as myself; and then, instead of lamenting past calamities we might all
cheerfully set to work to remedy them; and the greater the difficulties,
the harder our present privations, the greater should be our cheerfulness
to endure the latter, and our vigour to contend against the former.
