However, as I have said, Matilda at length yielded in some degree to her
mother’s authority (pity it had not been exerted before); and being thus
deprived of almost every source of amusement, there was nothing for it
but to take long rides with the groom and long walks with the governess,
and to visit the cottages and farmhouses on her father’s estate, to kill
time in chatting with the old men and women that inhabited them. In one
of these walks, it was our chance to meet Mr. Weston. This was what I
had long desired; but now, for a moment, I wished either he or I were
away: I felt my heart throb so violently that I dreaded lest some outward
signs of emotion should appear; but I think he hardly glanced at me, and
I was soon calm enough. After a brief salutation to both, he asked
Matilda if she had lately heard from her sister.
