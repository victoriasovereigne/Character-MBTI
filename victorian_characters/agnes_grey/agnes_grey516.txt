One morning, having sought and waylaid Mr. Weston, they returned in high
glee to give me an account of their interview. ‘And he asked after you
again,’ said Matilda, in spite of her sister’s silent but imperative
intimation that she should hold her tongue. ‘He wondered why you were
never with us, and thought you must have delicate health, as you came out
so seldom.’
