Right glad was I to get into the house, and find myself alone once more
in my own room. My first impulse was to sink into the chair beside the
bed; and laying my head on the pillow, to seek relief in a passionate
burst of tears: there was an imperative craving for such an indulgence;
but, alas! I must restrain and swallow back my feelings still: there was
the bell—the odious bell for the schoolroom dinner; and I must go down
with a calm face, and smile, and laugh, and talk nonsense—yes, and eat,
too, if possible, as if all was right, and I was just returned from a
pleasant walk.
