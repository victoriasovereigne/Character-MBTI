‘Now, Miss Grey, I’m Lady Ashby!’ she exclaimed. ‘It’s done, my fate is
sealed: there’s no drawing back now. I’m come to receive your
congratulations and bid you good-by; and then I’m off for Paris, Rome,
Naples, Switzerland, London—oh, dear! what a deal I shall see and hear
before I come back again. But don’t forget me: I shan’t forget you,
though I’ve been a naughty girl. Come, why don’t you congratulate me?’
