By these means I hoped in time both to benefit the children and to gain
the approbation of their parents; and also to convince my friends at home
that I was not so wanting in skill and prudence as they supposed. I knew
the difficulties I had to contend with were great; but I knew (at least I
believed) unremitting patience and perseverance could overcome them; and
night and morning I implored Divine assistance to this end. But either
the children were so incorrigible, the parents so unreasonable, or myself
so mistaken in my views, or so unable to carry them out, that my best
intentions and most strenuous efforts seemed productive of no better
result than sport to the children, dissatisfaction to their parents, and
torment to myself.
