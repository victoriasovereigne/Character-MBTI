On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.
Lorry came in late, from Tellsonâ€™s, and sat himself down by Lucie and
her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were
all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the
lightning from the same place.
