Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame
Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.

Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saintâ€™s mercies. The lamps across his streets had a
portentously elastic swing with them.
