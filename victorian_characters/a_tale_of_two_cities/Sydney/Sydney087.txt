The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some
half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once

regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages.
