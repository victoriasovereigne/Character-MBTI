Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between
her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and
there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,
did Miss Havishamâ€™s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except
that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former
characteristics.
