This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with
a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers
in Miss Havishamâ€™s house on the very day of our combat, but never at any
other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever
seen me there.
