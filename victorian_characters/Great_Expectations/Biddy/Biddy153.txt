“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “then abide by your words. If he’s always
right (which in general he’s more likely wrong), he’s right when he says
this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you
was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know’d as J. Gargery’s
power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his
inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do
not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv’ herself a
deal o’ trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost awful dull), as I
should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should
so put it. Both of which,” said Joe, quite charmed with his logical
arrangement, “being done, now this to you a true friend, say. Namely.
You mustn’t go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your
wine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets.”
