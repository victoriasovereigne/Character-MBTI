small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and

when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you

to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old
Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year
ago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like
a bullock, as he means to drop you--hey?--when he come for to hear
that--hey?”
