Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at
one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to

I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that
any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly,
silently, and surely, to take him.
