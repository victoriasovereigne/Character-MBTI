"I have very few relations," said Ermengarde, reflectively, "and I'm
very glad of it. I don't like those I have. My two aunts are always
saying, "Dear me, Ermengarde! You are very fat. You shouldn't eat
sweets," and my uncle is always asking me things like, "When did Edward
the Third ascend the throne?" and, "Who died of a surfeit of lampreys?'"
