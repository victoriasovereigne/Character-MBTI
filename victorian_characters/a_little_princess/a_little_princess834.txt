I hope you will not think it is impolite that I should write this note
to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret. Please believe I do
not mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all; only I want
to thank you for being so kind to me--so heavenly kind--and making
everything like a fairy story. I am so grateful to you, and I am so
happy--and so is Becky. Becky feels just as thankful as I do--it is
all just as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me. We used to
be so lonely and cold and hungry, and now--oh, just think what you have
done for us! Please let me say just these words. It seems as if I
OUGHT to say them. THANK you--THANK you--THANK you!
