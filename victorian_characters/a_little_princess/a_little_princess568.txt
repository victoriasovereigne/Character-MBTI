The winter was a wretched one. There were days on which Sara tramped
through snow when she went on her errands; there were worse days when
the snow melted and combined itself with mud to form slush; there were
others when the fog was so thick that the lamps in the street were
lighted all day and London looked as it had looked the afternoon,
several years ago, when the cab had driven through the thoroughfares
with Sara tucked up on its seat, leaning against her father's shoulder.
On such days the windows of the house of the Large Family always looked
delightfully cozy and alluring, and the study in which the Indian
gentleman sat glowed with warmth and rich color. But the attic was
dismal beyond words. There were no longer sunsets or sunrises to look
at, and scarcely ever any stars, it seemed to Sara. The clouds hung
low over the skylight and were either gray or mud-color, or dropping
heavy rain. At four o'clock in the afternoon, even when there was no
special fog, the daylight was at an end. If it was necessary to go to
her attic for anything, Sara was obliged to light a candle. The women
in the kitchen were depressed, and that made them more ill-tempered
than ever. Becky was driven like a little slave.
