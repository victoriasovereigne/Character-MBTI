"'Twarn't for you, miss," she said hoarsely to Sara one night when she
had crept into the attic--"'twarn't for you, an' the Bastille, an'
bein' the prisoner in the next cell, I should die. That there does
seem real now, doesn't it? The missus is more like the head jailer
every day she lives. I can jest see them big keys you say she carries.
The cook she's like one of the under-jailers. Tell me some more,
please, miss--tell me about the subt'ranean passage we've dug under the
walls."
