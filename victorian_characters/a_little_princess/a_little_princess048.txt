"It was full of petticoats with lace frills on them--frills and
frills," she whispered to her friend Jessie as she bent over her

Miss Amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous
for a child. My mamma says that children should be dressed simply. She
has got one of those petticoats on now. I saw it when she sat down."
