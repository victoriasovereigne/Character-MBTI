How poor Becky stared at her! In fact, she had never heard such a
nice, friendly sound in anyone's voice before. She was used to being
ordered about and scolded, and having her ears boxed. And this one--in
her rose-colored dancing afternoon splendor--was looking at her as if
she were not a culprit at all--as if she had a right to be tired--even
to fall asleep! The touch of the soft, slim little paw on her shoulder
was the most amazing thing she had ever known.
