"I dare say it is rather hard to be a rat," she mused. "Nobody likes
you. People jump and run away and scream out, "Oh, a horrid rat!" I
shouldn't like people to scream and jump and say, "Oh, a horrid Sara!"
the moment they saw me. And set traps for me, and pretend they were
dinner. It's so different to be a sparrow. But nobody asked this rat
if he wanted to be a rat when he was made. Nobody said, "Wouldn't you
rather be a sparrow?'"
