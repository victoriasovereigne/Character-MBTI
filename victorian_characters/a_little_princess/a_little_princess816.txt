Very naturally, even Becky was beginning to look plumper and less
frightened. She could not help it. She had her share in the secret
fairy story, too. She had two mattresses, two pillows, plenty of
bed-covering, and every night a hot supper and a seat on the cushions
by the fire. The Bastille had melted away, the prisoners no longer
existed. Two comforted children sat in the midst of delights.
Sometimes Sara read aloud from her books, sometimes she learned her own
lessons, sometimes she sat and looked into the fire and tried to
imagine who her friend could be, and wished she could say to him some
of the things in her heart.
