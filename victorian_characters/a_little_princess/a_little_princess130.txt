So the younger children adored Sara. More than once she had been known
to have a tea party, made up of these despised ones, in her own room.
And Emily had been played with, and Emily's own tea service used--the
one with cups which held quite a lot of much-sweetened weak tea and had
blue flowers on them. No one had seen such a very real doll's tea set
before. From that afternoon Sara was regarded as a goddess and a queen
by the entire alphabet class.
