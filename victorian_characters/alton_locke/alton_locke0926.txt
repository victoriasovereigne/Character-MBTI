I took home the diary; but several days elapsed before I had courage to
open it. Let the words I read there be as secret as the misery which
dictated them. I had broken my mother's heart!--no! I had not!--The

narrower than her own--that God could hate his creature, not for its sins,
but for the very nature which he had given it--that, that had killed her.
