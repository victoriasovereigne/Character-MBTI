"Oh! but yon's amazing like Tom Sheridan's answer to his father. "Tom,"
says the auld man, "I'm thinking ye maun tak a wife." "Verra weel, father,"
says the puir skellum; 'and wha's wife shall I tak?" Wha's style shall I
tak? say all the callants the noo. Mak a style as ye would mak a wife, by
marrying her a' to yoursel; and ye'll nae mair ken what's your style till
it's made, than ye'll ken what your wife's like till she's been mony a year
by your ingle."
