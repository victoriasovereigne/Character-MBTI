the poor fellows' pawn-tickets, and Crossthwaite and I took the things

holding the door open, in their fear lest we should be locked up, or
entrapped in some way. Their spirits seemed utterly broken. Some three or

to work. That, even that dungeon, was their only home--their only hope--as
it is of thousands of "free" Englishmen at this moment.
