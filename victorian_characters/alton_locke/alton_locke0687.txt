Fearing lest many words might betray my rank--and, strange to say, though
I should not have been afraid of confessing myself an artisan before the
"gentlemen" who had just left the room, I was ashamed to have my low estate

them--I answered, "Anything--I really don't care," in as aristocratic and
off-hand a tone as I could assume.
