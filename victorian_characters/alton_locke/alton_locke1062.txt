"I dare say they are liable, like other men, to confound the thing with its
abuses; but if they hadn't some dim notion that the thing might be made a

those abuses so fiercely." (The reader may see that I had not forgotten my
conversation with Miss Staunton.) "And," thought I to myself, "is it not

that one really cannot tell which is which, and longs to shove the whole
thing aside as rotten to the core, and make a trial of something new?"
