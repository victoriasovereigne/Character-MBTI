"Not so--I trust that you have still a work to do. But if not, promise me
that, whatever be the event of your voyage, you will publish, in good time,
an honest history of your life; extenuating nothing, exaggerating nothing,
ashamed to confess or too proclaim nothing. It may perhaps awaken some rich
man to look down and take pity on the brains and hearts more noble than
his own, which lie struggling in poverty and misguidance among these foul
sties, which civilization rears--and calls them cities. Now, once again,
farewell!"
