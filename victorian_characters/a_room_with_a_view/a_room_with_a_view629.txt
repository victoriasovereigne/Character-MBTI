“Yes--really in a better way. I want you to have your own thoughts even

quick--there’s no time for us to talk now--come to me as you came in the
spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain. I have cared
for you since that man died. I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I
thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all
the world is glorious water and sun. As you came through the wood I
saw that nothing else mattered. I called. I wanted to live and have my
chance of joy.”
