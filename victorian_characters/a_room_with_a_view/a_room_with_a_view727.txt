She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little
again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station. It had poured
all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of
water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy. Leaning forward, she looked
out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a
search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful. “The
crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked. For
they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been
dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old
mother. “We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and
yet it isn’t raining. Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the
horse’s hoofs--“He has not told--he has not told.” That melody was
blurred by the soft road. “CAN’T we have the hood down?” she demanded,
and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop
the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with
the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck. But now
that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have
missed--there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round
the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
