They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five oâ€™clock. That amiable
hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do

sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably. Mr. Beebe saw that
Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be
dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces. They would hand
the child her food through the window. Thus he was incidentally enabled
to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
