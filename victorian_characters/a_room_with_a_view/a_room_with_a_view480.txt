“She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily. The remark was a happy one,
for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands
of females. She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women
who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety
by print. Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be
written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil
yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his
plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath. But
soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the
darkness. There were too many ghosts about. The original ghost--that
touch of lips on her cheek--had surely been laid long ago; it could be
nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once. But it
had begotten a spectral family--Mr. Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter,
Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets--and one or other of these was bound to
haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes. It was Miss Bartlett who returned
now, and with appalling vividness.
