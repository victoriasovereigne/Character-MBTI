“I don’t mean exactly that. But you will question me, though I beg you
not to, and I must say something. It is that, more or less. When we
were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always
protecting me.” Her voice swelled. “I won’t be protected. I will choose
for myself what is ladylike and right. To shield me is an insult. Can’t
I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through

she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”--she
rose to her feet--“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may
understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you
wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up
me. I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are
more glorious, and you hide them from me. That’s why I break off my
engagement. You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when
you came to people--” She stopped.
