“I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly. “I might have
known there would have been these dreadful explanations. Of course,
it isn’t the tennis--that was only the last straw to all I have been
feeling for weeks. Surely it was better not to speak until I felt
certain.” She developed this position. “Often before I have wondered if
I was fitted for your wife--for instance, in London; and are you fitted
to be my husband? I don’t think so. You don’t like Freddy, nor my
mother. There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all
our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good
mentioning it until--well, until all things came to a point. They have
to-day. I see clearly. I must speak. That’s all.”
