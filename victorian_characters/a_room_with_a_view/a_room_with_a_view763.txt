“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the
world. It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound
so dreadful. It is on my muddles that I look back with horror--on the
things that I might have avoided. We can help one another but little. I
used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know
better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware
of muddle. Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be
annoyed with me and weren’t? Do you remember before, when you refused
the room with the view? Those were muddles--little, but ominous--and I
am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent. “Don’t trust me,
Miss Honeychurch. Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.”
She was still silent. “‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public
performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you
go along.’ I think he puts it well. Man has to pick up the use of his
functions as he goes along--especially the function of Love.” Then he
burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean. You love George!”
And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like
waves from the open sea.
